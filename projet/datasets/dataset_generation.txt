Praying Mantis Aliens - where, when and how did they evolve?
Apologies if this seems off-topic. This could be knowledge that reptilians have, and I know next to nothing about relations between reptilians and mantis-like aliens and beings.

Are any known stars and planets in this galaxy or universe known to be home to praying mantis aliens?
reptilian
in a world long forgotten by history, there lived a race of beings known as reptilian humanoids. They were a proud and ancient species, with a rich culture and history stretching back thousands of years. They lived in harmony with nature and worshipped the gods of the earth, air, and sky.

One of their most revered myths was the story of a woman named Lilith, who was gifted with knowledge and wisdom by a wise and benevolent lizard man. The story went that the lizard man appeared before Lilith and offered her an apple, which she accepted. As she ate the fruit, she felt a strange and powerful energy coursing through her veins, and her mind expanded to encompass a vast and timeless understanding of the universe.

For centuries, the story of Lilith and the lizard man was passed down from generation to generation, and it became a symbol of the power of knowledge and wisdom. It was told in song and dance, and was the subject of countless works of art, including a stunning painting that was said to have been created over 3,000 years ago.

The painting, which was discovered in the ruins of an ancient temple in 1450 BC, depicts the moment of Lilith's transformation. It shows the lizard man, with his proud and noble features, offering the apple to the woman, who stands before him with an expression of wonder and awe. The colors are rich and vibrant, and the detail is extraordinary, capturing the moment of transformation in vivid detail.

However, as time passed and the original story was lost to the ages, the painting and the myth of Lilith and the lizard man were misinterpreted and became distorted. Over time, the lizard man was reimagined as a snake, and the story became one of temptation and sin, rather than enlightenment and knowledge.

And so it was that the tale of Lilith and the lizard man became the story of Adam and Eve, and the snake in the Garden of Eden. But despite this misinterpretation, the original story lived on, hidden away in the shadows of history, waiting to be rediscovered and remembered for the powerful and inspiring tale that it truly was.

Aliens, Antarctica and our Crisis and their (alien) Crisis Part 1

Something interesting Happened today.
I put the noose around my neck and said the last words that life was unfair to me, that no one wants me, that I experienced more pain than pleasure. And when I was about to fall, I heard: "No". The voice seemed to be my nephew's, but there was no one in the yard, I put down my rope and went to my room, after two or three minutes, the nephew and his father, come home, he enters the room (I hate the nephew, it's annoying) and his father leaves. If I fell, they would have found me and called an ambulance and I probably would have survived and I would have been much more destroyed than I am now.
These Reptilians controlled them,they sent them to stop me.These aliens gave me these thoughts to kill myself,they control people around me such as my family, relatives to annoy me,to make me  wants to kill myself.When I want to do it,to  hang myself,they stop me.I can't take it anymore,I should be dead right now,I deserve death!

I would like to let you know, I have gotten a lot of negative feedback in this community, I don't think you very much realize this but this subreddit is not about being against the reptilian people It's about just factthey exist That's all it's about If anything it's about the science of the reptilian people in their existence, Period ! 

My point to this post, Is if you really hate their people you need to make your own subreddit Absolutely everybody on the entire website of Reddit can make their own subreddit, No matter your karma score. 

Go make a subreddit called : R/Anti-Reptilian

And leave this one alone Absolutely, Any of you and every one of you can make this up right at any time you want You do not have the loiter around in this subreddit and be toxic hateful gunk shots at people who like reptilians. 

I am not an admin of this subreddit, I am a Participant here though. 



.  .  . End of my point, You can stop Reading this now .  .  . 




Go make your own community absolutely everybody can do one I'm not being offensive I'm not being toxic I'm not being derogative and not being belligent I'm literally telling you if you don't like the content I put here in other people to go make your own supper against the reptilian people.

And I Think u forgot about Big Brother.

Side Note : I've Already made the r/Pro-Reptilian Subreddit. 

I've already made it with a Smile, I'll be Uploading or they Need there so the people can eventually come on in praise reptilian people love the reptilian people If they are reptilian people they can have a positive and safe Environment. 

And I'm I'm fully aware how dark predatory aggressive dominant power loving and some of them extremely sadistic in their nature, Dogs are also very sadistic vicious and extremely predatory, If you think cats are little angels they are the most murderous violent animal in the animal kingdom, cats are bigger let's just say homicidal Animal than snakes and dogs combine. 

üòê 

The kitty may be pretty, but it's kill Count is a pity.

And on top of that fact, reptiles nor canines nor cats are the biggest takers of human life What it really is is mosquitoes, ü¶üü¶üü¶ü !

Because the arthropods are far more evil and far more dangerous but keep listening to the snarling, growling reptile. While the whole town full of people get abducted by the Gray Alien's and you never never seen never again That actually happens That literally happens whole towns go missing, entire towns of people go missing 411.

The Sacred Serpent : Since the Beginning of Time In All Cultures Everywhere in the World

All, Hail Jesus Christ !

I had a vision of a Reptilian
A couple of months ago let‚Äôs say around May or June of last year I went to sleep around 10-11 pm and I had this weird dream, vision or abduction with a tall 7-8 feet reptilian he was very tall, ge had this brownish sand color of his skin, and he couldn‚Äôt talk he just could communicate telepathically. He just told me that by 2030 the world was going to be fully dominated by them (Reptilians). 

The strangest thing about this dream, vision or abduction is that I felt very calm I didn‚Äôt feel fear nor nothing similar. I still remember it took place outside of my house in my backyard, it was at night as well. 

I wonder why was the reason of telling me that message that by 2030 they where going to conquer the world? I have read about the Reptilian race some say they are good and some say they are bad, I got a mix feeling about them as well.

How Reptilians shapeshift.
Reptilians are basically evolved from the ancient Raptor dinosaur.

The Reptile body is dense and the connection to their heart is harder to access which makes them able to do certain things human mammalians would never do. There are great Reptilians too of course like David Icke who exposes them.

The reason they can shape shift is because older species have more powers than younger species like humans.

The way they do it is by entering into the 2D flat plane of life and then coming back into 3D as the newly shapeshifted hologram being. 3D is a hologram. 2D is the projector.

This is why when they shift, it looks like a media glitch. They have to stay focused on their human form or else they zoom back to their original form. It‚Äôs harder to focus on the eyes part which is why eyes shift more.

Tonight while taking my kids diapers out to the bin I saw said neighbour walk from his front porch into the garage. Only thing is there is a wall. No door!

Justin Bieber Caught ‚ÄòShapeshifting into a Reptilian‚Äô By Hundreds Of Fans

Clones and why
So, clones. Particularly entertainment clones. I would like to hear your thoughts.

"Why?" is my first question, and "Where do they fit into the agenda? Are the Reptilians cloning them or is it a purely human endeavor? Do they clone them just in order to make attractive, talented superhuman-like entertainers, or is there something more to it?"

Also, in light of the recent claims that both Adele and Bieber have shapeshifted in public, how does that fit in with cloning? Are they hybrids? Why? I keep asking that question of "Why?" because I truly cannot understand right now how it fits together. Does it have something to do with energy feeding?

Kid Buu says CloneAid (sp?) in Canada produced him. This guy is not lying to my eyes. In fact, I think his subtle "I-can't-believe-you-are-just-going-along-with-this-you-dumb-shit-you-must-think-I'm-high-or-stupid" reactions in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJc5pZCD9u0) video to the interviewer's lack of reaction are telling.

Cloning capabilities are nothing new or profound. We all know technology is much further advanced than what is shown to the public. It doesn't even phase me hearing anything like this at this point. It's just something I have come to accept.

I myself saw what I believe to be an advanced aircraft on MT-41S in August 2005 at approximately 45.6553507,-112.2312604. This technology has yet to be revealed to the public, but I believe it was being tested at the time I spotted it. I was in vehicle with 5 other people at the time. While they initially all remembered the sighting, a year later some of them had altered mismatching memories of the event and after 3 years their memories were non existent. I myself have a very strong resistance to being hypnotized, although I'm not bullet proof. I have been able to keep the memory intact only because I made a sketch of the craft directly after seeing it and committed it to my long term memory, despite factthat none of our disposable cameras were working while we were parked beneath the craft. The point I'm making here is that what the public sees and thinks they know is nothing but smoke and mirrors and the USA has technological capabilities that exceed what even most conspiracy theorists can gather, although recent speculation regarding just what the OWG (One Word Gov) is capable of is probably more accurate than we realize or even want to accept. And I already believe we are well past the one-world-government stage, probably soon or directly after WW2.

I have a strong suspicion that Lady Gaga is a clone from Amy Winehouse's DNA. Not that I care or that it matters to me personally, but it's just something I take note of.

Britney Spears has come out multiple times saying she's a clone and even had [this animated music video "Break the Ice"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQFIKP9rGhQ) made for her where it shows her breaking out of the cloning facility.

And the Kid Buu guy could easily be explained away that he was "on something" but regardless of whether this guy was stoned during his interview doesn't matter to me in the slightest. To me, this guy is just dropping truth bombs left and right and the interviewer isn't too bright.

Anyway Mods, if this isn't appropriate for this board I understand and you can delete it.

I am non-violent, teachable, and desire good relations with your species. I am on a personal quest for wisdom and desire to know everything I possibly can about the universe. Thank you. You're awesome.**

It's a good day to be alive.

Some more food for thought. What if vampires is a constructed story made up by Reptilians
OK my theory today think about it. The vampires are phenomenal beings that can do Shapeshifting and have certain powers as long as they maintain drinking human blood. Now they have Dracula Dracula to me sounds a lot like Draco and if you look at Dracula and what his powers are is he is a Shapeshifter. He can shape shift from a rat or a bat or a wolf or human form. He can live forever as long as he continues to drink human blood. A lot of these things sounded very very similar to Reptilians. And the story of Dracula is really old really really old. So what if the story of Dracula was made up by Reptilians? Say it‚Äôs another one of those subliminal consciousness just to keep you knowing in your head that they exist so you can get that energy out there. I don‚Äôt know sounds like a theory. Could all just be craziness but I did some thinking about it and I was just thinking Dracula and Draco and then I started to think about all the features and I was like wow everything similar

Hi does anyone on this sub have a 1st or 2nd hand encounter story?

it'sI'm sick and tired of people thinking everything that gets posted about reptilian draconian means that not liked or appreciated...
Reptilian's have been the most influential culture for me throughout most my life, I love hard-core punk, and any other music that takes experiencing trauma to fully understand, and appreciate. It's my own fault it's taken so long to obtain a understanding that I've caused all of my horrific trauma by withstanding the ownership of being a victim.
LOL the sheep have no idea that our reptilian overlords and no interest in providing us even a raindrop of happiness. Once you realize the world is controlled by aliens/reptilians that hate us/eat us, it all makes sense.

Slow dripping reptilian culture subliminally to our kids?
So I was thinking about this today. I'm sure most of you are sure what slow dripping to the  media is. For the others who don't look it up cause my text device is busted so I won't get into that part . But the movie monsters inc. after thinking I'm starting to think it's a metaphor for children being tortured for their adrenachrome. Think about it.. main villain is reptile like that can basically shape shift or morph into it's surroundings and it operates in a top secret facility in a different dimension that comes into our dimension to scare little children because their screams produce energy for their dimension.

What reptilians do to keep awakened people trapped
 

\- They promote New Age/Buddhism/Hinduism as superior to soul trap, prison planet, gnosticism, dualist religions and philosophies, and just about anything else. If you don't read the vedas or subscribe to the buddhist tenets, if you don't like the Ra material, Eckhart Tolle, Dolores Cannon - you are wrong, negative, and stuck in duality and victimhood. If you talk too much about soul trap and reptilians/archons, too much for these people's liking that is, you are feeding reptilians your loosh/attracting them/refusing to heal you trauma/trapping yourself/rejecting source's love for you and all beings. As the ultimate twisted damage control move, they will sometimes go so far as to say prison planet and soul trap is what reptilians want you to believe and be focused on, and so instead you should be focused on whatever these people promote and make it all about positivity, love, oneness. (*Bottom line here is they try to censor this subject matter, make it look inferior, and control how invested other people are in it. As arguments they use exaggeration - and so might say something like "people here blame archons for everything", are "hyper-focused on the trap/only focused on the negative", are "depressed and live in fear"; or baseless assumptions about those who research this or disagree with new age, buddhism, etc. - so they will assume and confidently state these people are not going within, not doing the work, not healing their traumas, not trying to better their lives and environment, not tapping into their inner or higher knowing when they say something - because of course only they do those things.*)
what's the best images you guys have got of a reptilian/or otherwise?
I always hear people talk about finding images of reptilians or Demons in the deep web or an obscure website, but they're so disturbing to look at people get nauseous from them. Now I don't wanna be nauseous but I love seeing images of shit (ufos, shape-shifting, etc.) and I was hoping someone here had some or knew where to look

Many of you are Reptilians. I say 80% atleast of the members here. This is why you are subconsciously attracted to this subject. You've been told that the Reptilians created a matrix planet and trapped humans. Yet you see all of the videos with everyday people, media, up to royalty shapeshift... You are in prison but not by a stranger but your kind. You rebelled from  the "dragon god or queen" so you are living out your days mentally wiped and imprisoned in a 3d human body. Your are seeing possessed human beings, but you are the culprit. That reptile you are seeing is the real entity's whike the human is the biobot prison.That's why we gave them reptilian brains in the first place.

Also sometimes while tripping on high doses, I find myself in this other layer of reality, where everything is more real and sensible than this one. I find that I‚Äôm likened to some sort of alien-like being while there. Wondering if I‚Äôm a reptilian, but they‚Äôre evil so maybe not.

Did I meet a reptilian?
 Back in high school we would have a quick 5 minute meeting with some mental health counselor kinda person for a school mandated mental health program after multiple mental breakdowns from students and teachers. This person was never at the school before. 

During my 5 minute meeting(1 on 1 only) it felt very sinister and had a feeling of ‚Äúunhuman‚Äù. I‚Äôve never felt that before in my life about someone. 

Was that guy a reptilian or just a VERY powerful archon? 

I‚Äôve felt bad vibes about people but never ‚Äúunhuman‚Äù as a feeling. I didn‚Äôt notice anything weird about his eyes or neck or anything like that.

Asking for a friend üëÄ
Jeffrey Dahmer is an example of a reptilian host.
I have seen on Netflix the story of Jeffrey Dahmer and in the first episode when he watched the movie"Exorcist" he liked the scene when the demon-possessed someone ,because Dahmer felt possessed too, he was kinda in a trance when he watched the movie.
Dahmer didn't know why he killed those people, he didn't hate them, it's kinda like Smeagol from "Lord of the Rings" when he was Smeagol, he was good, when was golem he was evil. Maybe Dahmer had moments when the human side was turned on and later the human side turned off and the reptilian controlled his body to kill those people.
Jeffrey Dahmer used to eat the flesh of the corpses, I've checked his zodiac and Jeffrey Dahmer's Chinese zodiac was the rat, rats eat the flesh of corpses too.
Jeffrey Dahmer's favourite colour was blue, he was obsessed with blue colour, Lord Shiva's skin colour is blue and Shiva is a reptilian. On a website that's called"Joy of Satan," they say that blue colour is the colour of Satan.
Sometimes I wonder if these murderers were evil all the time,I believe in Parallel Universes and when you dream, you see yourself different, you see yourself from a parallel universe.I had a dream, in that dream, I was an assassin, I know because I saw guns in my house, special forces came and I killed them, so if in this Universe I'm good then in a Parallel Universe I could be evil. In this life, we make our preparations for the next life, but in this life the system we aren't healthy, we eat junk food, drink alcohol, we kill our soul because of the system.Dahmer was an alcoholic, then certainly he was alcoholic in his previous life too, alcohol kills your soul, Dahmer was corrupted so much by the system in his previous life that he ended up killing his soul.When he was born in this Universe that we are right now, Dahmer was empty, he was like a robot, you could see that he seemed soulless. These serial killers Dahmer, Ted Bundy may were good people in their previous life, but the system killed their soul and made them be puppets of the reptilians.

am i a reptilian? im a halfjewish trans woman with neurological disorders
hi, im a trans woman with tourette syndrome, autism and OCD (officially diagnosed). my dad is jewish by descent (he went to hebrew school when he was a kid) though now he is religiously catholic. 

i wanna know if i am a reptilian because i want to shapeshift into a pretty lady, but i dont know how (right now i am a bit ugly). how do reptilians shapeshift? am i capable of doing it?

my tourette syndrome has had a symptom called ‚ÄúRage Attacks‚Äù since i was a little kid. Here is an article about it: https://movementdisorders.ufhealth.org/2015/07/07/anger-outbursts-and-tourette-syndrome/ basically, i randomly get overwhelmed by minor irritations and blow up/have meltdowns every once in a while. it‚Äôs not as bad as it used to be because i take strong antipsychotics now. i dont like having meltdowns, it feels very bad.

my family on my dad‚Äôs side is a bit weird. for instance, my aunt (my dad‚Äôs sister) is very weird. i think she might be mentally ill. also, the family tree records on my dad‚Äôs side dont go back very far because only a few generations ago, they had to abandon everythin they had and flee the soviet union.

do u think i am a reptilian? please leave a comment.
Cloaking device discovered?
I have an idea on where their cloaking tech is located. I think it‚Äôs a wristband. It may be on both wrists, but on at least one for sure.

At the 1:20 mark on [this vid](https://www.reddit.com/r/reptilians/comments/tcew4f/the_lizard_people_conspiracyfact_explained_all/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) you can see the news anchor‚Äôs hand decloak, looks like there‚Äôs a wristband there.

Will edit this later with additional popular decloak clips. But if you watch the same vid around the 1:43 mark, it is when the pastor swings the same hand that the cloak fails. Same vid again, 5:22 mark, the basketball player‚Äôs hand deforms during fast movement.

Then there‚Äôs the clips of celebrities decloaking and holding onto their wrists. (Will add links later).

Just some observations. What do you all think. Seems like rapid movements would make sense for a reason for cloaking to have errors.

Edit 1: Also, there is an interesting story from ufo researcher Preston Dennett about an Atlantean bracelet that some lady owned for which saucers were constantly harassing her. [Here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtH49ZMw4MM)

Help finding a video
Hi, I am looking for a video that I saw years ago of a reptilian caught on camera.  The circumstances were that a young boy was filming his dad who was sitting at his desk in the house, and accidentally recorded a reptilian in the house with them.  As the camera points away from Dad and this alien creature was really close up, and VERY convincing and scary looking with large eyes and detailed features.  Well, that made the news and it's actually attached to a news clip where they interview the boy about it.  If I recall correctly, this was in a latin speaking country.   I have been looking to come across this video, and it's by far the most compelling one I have ever seen regarding reptilians.  Really cool video.  Can anyone here find this for me?

What do you use to sink the shapeshifting heat?
You know, when you're shapeshifting, it sometimes gets really hot. Since we're reptiles we don't have issues with the temperature of our bodies changing often, but sometimes it just gets too hot. How do you deal with that? I'm using mostly cold water and ice cubes
Do you really believe that we aren't real?

The Anti-soul Agenda.
* The Controllers desperately want us to forget that we have Souls. Even though we exist in a material world filled to the brim with many different kinds of Souls, Spirits and Consciousness, they would like us to forget our Soul. Tyrants cannot control our mind as easily, if we know how to connect with our Soul.
Without understanding the worldwide agenda of trauma based mind control, we cannot understand our participation in the constructs put in place to keep it going. We become unknowing participants, in perpetuating these systems. It is difficult to witness how many people on the spiritual path, and how many practitioners and session providers, have this blind spot, and are unable to see the pervasiveness of this agenda.

To intentionally disconnect the existence of the mind from the existence of the soul is extremely destructive and damaging to all human beings. This fact is what contributes to the manifestation of disconnected and chronically miserable people who intentionally create harm without moral conscience.
Soul Disconnected people behave in a similar manner to artificial intelligence robots, as they are shaped by mass media to make decisions based on survival and selfish desires, with no authentic thoughts or emotional states of their own making. Disconnection conveniently pushes forward the basic agenda of Psychology to be very effective in furthering the Transhumanism agenda. Today, if people are unhappy and disconnected from their mind and soul, they are given a pharmaceutical drug to take control over their bio-neurological system functioning, which leads to lifelong pharmaceutical dependencies and addictions. Administering synthetic drugs to impair bio-neurological functioning of the brain further impairs and damages the Soul body, making it nearly impossible for a person to experience Soul embodiment or perceive the nature of their Soul.

* Unfortunately, when people are disconnected from their Soul through the rigid belief that they do not have one, they will not gain higher consciousness or higher sensory perception ability. In order to perceive beyond the illusions of the material world or third dimension, we must connect with our spiritual bodies. When we are connected to higher dimensions of consciousness while in a body, we greatly increase our capacity to perceive the many layers of the spiritual-energetic nature of our reality. Thus, we know that informed consensus between the people on the earth does not yet exist. Earthlings have not been informed of the extraterrestrial nature of our real origins, or the regular intervention and control that is made in planetary affairs by the off-worlders. When the mass population is not informed of the truth in these matters, and is continually lied to in order to base their existence on piles of mass deception, there is no such thing as informed consensus.

Thus, Scientific Atheism has a critical relevance in shaping current systems that control beliefs in the mainstream areas of Science, Medicine and Education, which unequivocally affirm that we are alone in a cosmos devoid of supernatural realms.

The Anti-Soul Agenda seeks to create division through polarization of people‚Äôs thinking into holding staunch oppositions that they will defend at all costs in order to win their argument. Their assertion is that there is no credible scientific evidence for the existence of a God, Soul or Spirit. Yet, as we are well aware, there is no acknowledgement of the scientific evidence that validates and describes:

* Why and how we fall in love, How deep emotional bonds between people communicate telepathically, Human communication with many kinds of supernatural forces and entities, Transcendental, intuitive and empathic consciousness experiences of at-one-ment, Synchronistic events, which hold deep meaning in our lives for no apparent logical reason, Near Death Experiences (NDE‚Äôs), proof of Afterlife or Soul Projection into other dimensions. Millions of people experience these kinds of consciousness experiences throughout the world every day, no matter what kind of belief system they have. Science as it is being controlled today, will never be capable of explaining these consciousness experiences related to our soul, with empirical data based on informed consensus. It is important to always remember, there are beautiful and kind people that can be found within every kind of scientific or medical field. We need to focus on our common humanitarian goals, and always be kind and Compassionate to the people involved, no matter what their belief system

Without this critical knowledge of the Soul, Psychiatrics as it exists today, covertly exacerbates the NAA spiritual abuse conditioning through its social and biological engineering methods. Thus, it functions to reinforce medical care methods that induce mental body splitting, that ultimately create soul fracturing in the human public. Social Engineering is a type of Mind Control that seeks to manipulate people from their own right to privacy, into becoming knowledgeable and self-informed, so that the social structure can exploit them with misinformation that is used to take control of their behaviors. The primary method is applied via bullying, intimidation and deception tactics through controlling perception and by generating personal or mass fears, real or imagined in their targets.

* Thus, this includes an Anti-Soul Agenda to enforce the basis of standard Psychiatric medical care to be fully governed and regulated by only western medical and military corporate conglomerate interests. These controlling interests only consider the revenue and resources generated from the physical pathologies that they have produced, in order to diagnose the public using their catalogue of pharmaceutically treatable disorders and diseases. Inducing and maintaining disease states to create lifelong medical consumers not only greatly suppresses human consciousness it generates multiple billions in revenue worldwide. The American Psychiatric Association or APA, offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM. The DSM primarily evolved out of the US Army after World War II. It is currently used by every governing agency that is intricately connected to the many laws and policies that make up the current medical establishment, such as; drug regulation agencies, pharmaceutical companies, medical insurance companies, clinicians, hospitals, the World Health Organization, as well as for military psychological profiling. Naturally, the DSM has tightly guarded copyrights that continue to make millions of dollars just from the publication and distribution of the manual itself.

* The combination of growing massive corporate medical and drug profits, damaging bio-neurological functioning through prescribed pharmaceuticals, standardizing psychiatric diagnostic categories for Dehumanization Agendas, and medically treating humans as soul-less entities, creates the perfect front for the NAA. This allows them to continue to enforce abusive standards of medical care that are intentionally used to split apart the mind from the soul, contributing to the creation of disconnected and violent humans. Medical professionals and patients are indoctrinated to commit and accept the abuse of their fellow human being as appropriate, while stripping them of their human dignity, choice and wellbeing, all in the name of health care. The obvious motivation is that this greatly weakens and confuses many human beings, making them vulnerable to every kind of deception and dark manipulation. This leads to easy forms of mind control, social conditioning to accept anti-human behavior, taking mind altering pharmaceuticals, believing that a pill will cure problems, serious suffering while in disease states, and finally dark force possession.

* When we can comprehend the larger picture of what is happening on the earth, the reasons behind this dehumanization agenda in the psychiatric and medical field becomes clearer and clearer. Why would these structures be put in place with the image that they are designed to heal and help people, when the primary motivation of the structure is to make money from the continued suffering and disease of others? Have you noticed the reversals inside these structures, compared to what they are actually marketed to represent? As an example, a medical research organization may represent them selves as devoting millions of dollars in grant money, from drug companies, toward finding a cure for cancer, but in reality they do not want to find a cure because it‚Äôs not profitable to the drug companies. It basically becomes a shell company to move money around to the people that play ball with the NAA. The answers lie behind the mechanisms that are used in society to disconnect people from their direct spiritual relationship with Soul, through the same tactics used in Satanic Ritual Abuse SRA.

* The current 3D timeline in which humans have existed on the earth over the last hundred years, has been socially engineered through technological Mind Control, violent entertainment and predictive programming in the media to promote a death culture. Social Engineering is a type of mind control that seeks to manipulate people from their own right to privacy by controlling the way they access information. Controlling what it means to be knowledgeable and self-informed, so the fabricated social structure can exploit them with misinformation, making it easier to control of their behaviors. Thus, today, many people are unable to identify and recognize the clear signs of death culture programming as a result of the Controller Anti-Soul Agendas, because it has been interwoven into many of the day to day structures that make up the fabric of society. Why do the Controller structures promote and financially reward all organizations and media that promote death culture programming into our world? Death Culture produces the myopic mental polarization of attention upon purely physical sensations and material pursuits. It does not look deeper towards taking any responsibility. There is no accountability, moral or ethical consideration towards the consequences of actions that are directly related to increasing world pain and human suffering. Instead, the mainstream death culture programming thrives in producing, marketing and exploiting human suffering, pain and trauma, therefore, spreading the destructive lifestyles that lead to mass killing, disease and slavery. If we cannot identify or recognize how the death culture programming has generated great harm to impact our personal lives, children, families, communities, businesses and nations, we will not understand what we must change inside ourselves in order to heal our society.

* The Anti-Human Agenda is to deny the existence of Individualism and individual Soul, and to refuse to treat people as unique individuals capable of autonomy and Self-Leadership. To become unified as a species, it requires that we remove the many societal labels and manufactured classifications and be able to see people as unique individuals with their own individual behavior based upon their unique soul Blueprint. Individuals should be considered competent based upon their own demonstrated behaviors and personal merits, and to know that all unique souls on the earth belong to the human race and are worthy of respect, dignity and opportunity. Simultaneously, barbaric and cruel behaviors which have been made acceptable within poverty stricken, survival orientated and violent cultures must be corrected through re-education. As well, there must be consequences for violent behavior and that which is directing intentional harm, in an enlightened society that protects freedom and values human lives.

Negative Aliens.
* The main groups of Negative Aliens, the Annunaki, Drakonians, Zetas and Necromitons that source out of the Phantom Matrix spaces in the parallel systems, formed alliances with the Fallen Angelic Annunaki Groups to take control over the earth, which are referred to as the NAA. These groups used technology to open Wormholes that were blended together to create the power required to attempt to pull the earth body into the Black Hole System leading into the phantom matrix where they exist, and then could gain total control over the planet and humanity. The parallel system of which these entities came from is called the Wesa system. This is a universal time matrix and its parallel of which many of the Anunnaki and their hybrids originate from the Wesedak system, while the Drakonians species are coming from antiparticle universe called the Wesedrak system. 

They joined together to run energetic reversals in the planet in order to realign the earth with their system through the wormholes and black hole system they created for that purpose.

* They joined with the Fallen Angelics to counteract and destroy the Christiac Human Guardian Race for control and domination of this Time Vector in this Universal Time Matrix. These are also called the Black Suns or Black Sun Agenda.

* Reptile Insectoid Collective:

* Dragon Moth from Orion Black hole system.
* Necromiton beetle hominid
* Men in Black from Nibiruian lines.
* Marduk Omicron (sound familiar?) from Alpha Centuari.
* Centaur Hybrids from Omega Centauri.
* Zeta from Rigel, Zeta Drakonian Agendas.
* Zeta From Zeta Reticuli.

* The Zetas are interested in Breeding Programs to create Zeta human hybrids in order to maintain control over the earth in the future timelines. Thus, they formed covert agreements with the world governments and allied forces during World War II in order to reproduce their own race, and through which they could use the Zeta Hive Mind to more effectively mind control the population of the earth. During World War II treaties were made with the allied government, and as a result, several organizations, black operations and covert groups such as Majestic 12 were set up to further administer to these treaties, while secretly testing out assorted alien technologies, weaponry while reverse engineering space craft, and these activities are what began the Compartmentalization process to set up different factions for the Secret Space Programs as well as build deep underground complexes for high level testing of these alien technologies carried out by the Military Industrial Complex.

* The most aggressive and violent of the Zeta groups are those that come from the star system Rigel, and thus are called Rigelians or Zeta Drakonian Rigelians. They are extremely dangerous to humans as they endorse aggressive genocidal and eugenicist agendas to takeover the earth, and present themselves as Guardians or benevolent humanoids in order to seduce earth humans to further their invasion and hybridization agendas. They generally prefer to use a Nordic blond fair skinned human body, or Tall White when they are masquerading as a human being. Therefore, they are known to be one of the most hostile of the NAA intruding entity groups, they can shape-shift into appearing human like and are referred to as H.A.V.'s, placed in the category of Hostile Alien Visitors.

* The Negative Alien agenda NAA is to force the planet to serve another multiple species Controller agenda, through imposing false replicated time fields using bio-warfare technology such as Holographic Inserts, AI and Mind Control, namely created under genetic reptilian-insectoid Archon extraterrestrials, at the expense and life force of the human race and the kingdoms under the human domain. Much of the NAA is veiled in the shadow levels of the ET and human military industrial complex, the primary takeover access in the naval forces and in the underground bases of the earth. It appears earth was invaded several times by hostile Negative Aliens with a major shift occurring 26,000 years ago during the Luciferian Rebellion, Atlantian Cataclysm and leading to the latest event during the Sumerian-Egypt Invasion. These agendas are still in effect today and impact all human and earthly life as a enforced enslavement on a Prison Planet, being harvested for a variety of resources to send back to off planet Controllers, such as collecting energetic quanta of human life force and earthly minerals.

The Black Sun DNA is a reversal base 10 genetic template that is sourced originally from Fallen Seraphim and the Orion Winged Draconian reptilians in the tenth dimensional layers as the result of the damage incurred in the Universal Time Matrix, which further generated several hybrid lines. The Black Sun genetic template does not allow for natural biological ascension or cellular transmutation of the consciousness body or organic movement into other timelines. This is the main reason they chose immortality through parasitism and control over humanity, which necessitated building the phantom worlds in the reversal base 10 template, and creating the blended reality system in order to exist in the three-dimensional consciousness on earth. The dark archangels are the fallen counterparts of the original Gold Order Seraphim, which became infiltrated by Orion Winged Dracs and the Azriel lineage of dark angelics. Throughout the lower dimensions, this contributed to proliferation of the Black Sun DNA in the Zeta groups and reptilian insectoid collectives, that over time digressed their DNA even further, unable to procreate in their race lines. Shortly after the Thothian Luciferians orchestrated the Essene Massacre and institution of hybrid breeding programs, the Black Suns infiltrated the material realm with the same goal to take over the earth stargates and gain control from the Belial group, which had just orchestrated their final takeover event after the Atlantian Cataclysm.

* The Black Sun lineages have since been working towards their ultimate goal of centralized world domination through the management of many crusades and wars that were designed for the biological extermination of the Essene lineages of the original incarnated Taran human souls, to prevent their rise to power. They then placed themselves in the most powerful positions within the majority of the world governments, world banking institutions, federal reserve, global organizations for policy making and further inserted themselves into the majority of the ruling class Power Elite bloodlines that are still actively operating today. The Black Sun lines that infiltrated the earth over the last ten thousand years made agreements with the Zeta and Drakonians during the 1930‚Äôs, which brought them much more power and reinforcement from off planet sources and began their dominance in colonizing other planets. This set up from NAA Black Sun sources allowed them to dominate the management of the largest and richest multinational corporations and pharmaceutical industries, which were effective storefronts to cover up many crimes against humanity. As well as setting up the shadow military industrial complex in which to develop an assortment of covert weaponry to subdue and manipulate humanity. The evidence for the assortment of weaponized electromagnetic technologies in usage today, such as the weaponization of smart phones, are beginning to be sensed directly and their results made much more visible for those that are awakening during the ascension cycle.

* The Orion Group is a Satanic force that has a predatorial ideology that uses females as slaves or breeders, while seeking territorial dominion on other planets within their warring and killing culture. Their position in the NAA and its consortium of Negative Aliens is called the Black Sun Program. They are a predator force with a predator mind which is mainly responsible for creating much of the Negative Ego in humanity through Mind Control programming and they have introduced financial and Debt Enslavement to planet earth through the banking cartels, which require Blood Sacrifice.

* The direction of life force [collected through the NRG Grids] is hierarchical and managed by the Alpha Draconis system that spans between the Draco constellation and the Orion Constellation, however multiple conflicts exist within the system and the fight for its resources exist among many species, the reptilian and draconian levels of contingents. There is a vast system of bottom feeders and defectors.

* The Orion Group is a Satanic force that has a predatorial ideology that uses females as slaves or breeders, while seeking territorial dominion on other planets within their warring and killing culture. Their position in the NAA and its consortium of Negative Aliens is called the Black Sun Program. They are a predator force with a predator mind which is mainly responsible for creating much of the Negative Ego in humanity through Mind Control programming and they have introduced financial and Debt Enslavement to planet earth through the banking cartels.

* Additionally the Nordics are blond looking humans from Orion and are also predatorial, this species is responsible for spreading racism, genetic discrimination, genetic experimentation, such in the Nazi ideology and they are proponents of promoting their belief system of "genetic superiority" through spiritually abusive methods of Eugenics. This Nordic group was directly involved with Hitler's Germany and World War II.

* Dracos species are potentially capable of shape-shifting and have extremely developed Psionic abilities, which allow them to possess or enter bodies through consciousness projection. Therefore, as they originate form a Phantom Matrix system of Satanic based AI infected entities, many of these Draco entities are confused by people as the devil or believing they are Satan, as an individual figure.

Deadly 'Reptilian' Encounters Uncovered in Pennsylvania Coal Mines

They are killing my soul.
They managed to stop me from practising Yoga Hatha, Kundalini...etc.These beings always find a way to put you down. Im once again in the place that I was before(Drinking soda, not exercising and so on). I want to change! I experienced not being in my comfort zone, but these reptilians send me back to the place where I was before.

If reincarnation wouldn't exist, I would kill myself right now. Now they make to not know what to write, I'm possessed by some creature from astral.

I havet a vision that came out of nowhere, it was me, I had a white shirt(The white colour isn't a lucky one for me)and my mouth kinda had blood, the shape of my mouth was üîº with sharp teeth and red eyes. That was the creature who is attached to my astral body, it showed me that is killing my soul. I notice that it's killing me slowly, most people don't notice the mess that they are in. I know that I'm doomed, others don't know that they are the food for these beings.

It's hard to say something when you have an alien attachment to your astral body, I can't express myself clearly because of this alien that it's killing me.
These reptilians could remove this creature very easily from me, but they don't, because they are the ones that allowed the creature to attach to my astral body.
After the alien kills your soul, your body will belong to the alien.The ending of "Unknown" from " Tekken tag 2 " gives you an idea what will happen to you after your  soul die, that wasn't an ocean where the Unknown was, but the astral.The angel(Alien) came and took everything from Jin's mother and let her go deep into that black portal which represents a portal that send you into a parallel Universe.This is what happens after you die, you are born in a Parallel Universe  and experience pain once again.
Did you saw this in Tekken Tag 2?
A long time ago I didn't know what the "Unknown" ending means, but now I know and it's the painful fate that awaits us after death.
She is drowning(It seems that she's in Astral) the angel(Alien Nordic) makes a light, came and takes the power from Jin's mother, she leaves and lets her go deep.

It's been said that after you die, you will see a light, if you go into the light, you will reincarnate, but she didn't go into the light, the alien who come from the light, takes the power from Jun(Unknown)her unknown form symbolises the occult knowledge, strength...etc.
The alien took the power from her and she's naked like she's a baby. After the alien leaves her, Unknown seems to go into a black portal.
It's been said that after you die, you will reincarnate into a parallel universe. That Black portal sends her to a Parallel Universe, being naked means that she's a üë∂ who will be born once again in the matrix. We, humans are born naked, so makes a lot of sense! The bad alien took everything from her, power, knowledge and memories(We humans are born without knowing where we came from).
It's not a happy ending, but a doomed one.
I can't believe that I didn't saw this back then.
This is her ending:https://youtu.be/XySIU_3IY_8
The second one actually looks quite realistic!

REMOVING THE VEIL- Watch Mr.88's hologram split in half and burst!!! Are they truly angels and demons? When tech fails it looks and seems like God blurred it's TRUE face underneath...

Satan the Prince of the powers of the Air

I'm in a different place.
I'm no longer in the place that I was before. When I say "place" doesn't mean house or city, but my consciousness.
Everyone behaves differently when they are near me
It's like I'm a different person, my old self is gone!
I can't go back to the place that I was before, there is no turning back.
The more I stay in asana, the more I go to different places.It's like I travel to parallel Universes, those who knows me don't talk the same way they did when I wasn't into occult.Someone who doesn't practice meditation can't go to different places.

People feel good when they are close to someone who has a clean aura, so these meditations aren't fake!It take months or years to see results, these meditations aren't easy, you need to have great patience and be very dedicated to these meditations.
Today I was on the streets,I saw big guys, they think that they are "badass" but  I felt that they are weak.I felt like I can break these guys in half with my hands.I feel who is weak and who isn't.They are on low vibration, because they are into drugs, alcohol...etc.
Unfortunately, these beings attacked me last night! they made me feel that I'm trash, that I'm useless and I will die!My streak of practice Yoga every day come to an end, because they made me to have insomnia,i slept only 4 hours and I've was very tired to practice yoga, my head was in pain.
You can't practice yoga if you are in pain and I was supposed to stay in asana almost 4 minutes,I couldn't do it.sometimes it's better to listen to your body.Yoga isn't sport! Occult is the key to escape from this Hell, but I think that greys will kill us before to open the door.
I've seen an holographic insert
Is it from God or a reptilian ?
Can you lose your soul?
Is it possible to lose your soul?  Or for a reptilian to steal it?
oh..

Who is the enemy humans or reptilians?
I heard this thing that humans have to ban together and the enemies would be the reptilians.  What about evil humans with the reptilians?  Or would you just focus on the reptilians?
Protection from reptilians
Any advice for protection from reptilians? 

I don't know all I have is maybe low caffeine, health tips, exercise.

Any weapons that you use?
Reptilians artwork

Would've been the perfect ritual. Lot of people are noticing sightings of these cloud like jet lines in the sky. Watch out for them, you'd be surprised now many you might encounter.

I'm starting to notice that these beings are close to me.
Last night, I was on the sofa and when I got up and start walking,I felt that someone grabbed my shirt,I looked back  and no one was there. The people that are haunted by ghosts(Reptilians or Grays)are often touched by them, they left scars on them.I have many stretch marks on me, these are scars that are on the abdomen, hips, back...etc.But I have stretch marks on my arms too, if it was deeper the blood would come out(Almost holes on my arms).the website that I read about stretch marks didn't mention that you can have stretch marks on your arms,so isn't usual to have stretch marks on your arms.
Most people that are fat or athletics doesn't have stretch marks,I have stretch marks and last night I felt my shirt being grabbed by someone(i was alone in that room)there is no coincidence. I'm harassed physical and psychological  by them!These attacks are more intense now, because I've started practicing meditation, they don't want that.

They controll the sheeps and hosts make them come at me talking to me and laugh about me, a few days ago,I was walking on the streets, someone who knew me stopped his car and start talking to me(I didn't expect to see him)he was with his friends that I never saw them in my life, they were three inside the car(Grays come in number three to gang stalk people), I looked at one of them, he was smiling as he knew me before, but unfortunately for him and that guy who knew me, I'm no longer that funny guy who used to make people laugh, I made them lose their smile and he left without saying"Goodbye" or "take care".

When I was  inside the shop, his brother (Another host)came in, but he didn't recognize me.Host after host shows up in front of me to piss me off,that's why I don't enjoy going outside. These beings walk among us and they can be anyone,son isn't bad to be a hikikomori!People hate being a hikikomori, but I started liking being a hikikomori, but I still go outside to take my nephew from school, so you can't be what you want 100% because of these aliens.What I like about Hikikomori is that they are against society, this is good that they have this mentality to not like society, because in society there are many reptilians hosts who pissed you off for no reason.I will go outside after a few minutes ,I'm curious what will happen to me now, maybe they will make a ‚ö° to hit me or they can break my neck by making me slipping.
yall see this?

Would you stay at your job if your boss was a reptilian that feeds on your loosh?

I'm ready to give up
Too many of you are fake or have contradicting information. Many of you have a religious agenda. I've been looking into this for 6 years and come up empty handed. Theres just no way to know if the information presented is true. And there is so little actual information to begin with.
Help! Looking For A Resource I Once Had.
In a long forgotten Joe Rogan interview, Joe discusses how very down to earth ppl have had wild encounters.

He mentions the lead singer of one band firmly believes in reptilians. 

I googled it, and found an article where it was a person in the music industry who revealed themselves and said they wanted humans to suffer and die...

Again a person they had sex with transformed into a reptilian as well. 

Anyone remember who this was??? I‚Äôm looking for that same story again and just cannot find it...
My opinion about the gunman who killed those children in Texas.
The news about this gunman was shown even in Europe. I looked at this individual picture and he seemed soulless(Reptilians are soulless ). I admit that he had a face that I would punch every day!
He killed those children, his mother said: "He had his reason, don't judge him".That woman might be one of them too. Her son was a reptilian host who killed 19 children. He also killed animals(Cats) and he was recorded showing the dead cats(He was proud)so that bastard was a monster(Reptilian host).
These reptilians kill without mercy and anyone can be their victim.
People saw that cops aren't heroes. They killed that reptilian host, but they killed him too late. It took them nearly an hour to enter that school, so those cops were hosts too.
The movie " They Live" shows most cops being aliens, so makes sense now why they let that massacre happen.
MEDUSA!!!! Amber Heard's hair becomes a viper!!!

I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on reptilians
But I met 9 in 6 months, probably more. These beings engage in mind control and experiments on unwitting people usually helpless people in mental hospitals or prisons. I don't have any experience seeing them eat humans like some claim but I wouldn't doubt it. Everything they touch is a lie. They've made lying an artform. They extract information from you by lying to you to get you to fess up and give them whatever information they are looking for. Everything they say is a lie on top of a lie on top of a lie. They can change the vibe at your workplace with the snap of their fingers, they can make your job a living hell. They control groups of stalkers, they control the weather, traffic patterns, its insane.

Edit: forgot to say there seems to be a collective of people engaged in witchcraft that work with the reptilians
Encounter with a reptilian in a dream
So, first of all, this happened in a dream. It might be just a product of my subconscious, I often have weird, vivid dreams. This dream however, feels special, like it was not just a dream like any other, like there is more to it. An event that happened after the dream made me think, that there was really something more going on.

Before I move on to describe this encounter ‚Äì even if a contact actually was made, it doesn't mean that everything the reptilian said was true or that is trustworthy source or whatever.  Reptilians lie and deceive all the time. I don't remember some minor details either. Take whatever you want from it.

In my dream, I was walking by the lake on a sunny day, when I saw an osprey sitting on a tree branch. It was gigantic though ‚Äì more like the size of a white-tailed eagle, if not bigger. I was in awe, as I didn't expect to see such animal so close in its natural habitat. The bird flew to water, caught a fish and came back. I was still in shock and factthat my presence didn't bother it at all really surprised me. I thought to myself, that it is understandable that pagans back in the day used to worship nature if they saw such majestic animals. In that moment, the osprey looked straight into my eyes, flew down to the ground before me and transformed into a humanoid reptilian being. He was between 2 and 3 meters tall, with mainly brown and green scales, had a pair of wings and horns. He told me that he "misses those days", in reference to what I just thought about nature worship, showing his telepathic abilities. He said, that centuries ago he used to be worshipped as some kind of an eagle deity and even amongst his own kind he is considered a royal. I asked him if he is a demon and he denied. Then I asked him whether is he an earthling or an alien and he said that his species comes from Earth and lives in underground tunnels and that there are multiple layers of this reality, reptilians can move between those layers and that they interact with reality differently than humans do, and that they are also capable of interstellar travel. He also said that there are different classes of reptoids, some of them being genetically modified and others originating from other planets. He said that his class of reptilians are aristocrats amongst other reptoids, they can be distinguished mainly by their horns, wings and tail and they are often referred to as draconians. 

I suggested going to the hotel (?) and he agreed. The hotel looked very expensive and there were many rich-looking people walking around. He told me that all of those powerful people are just their puppets. We finally entered a room. This particular room didn't look as expensive and luxurious as the rest of the hotel. In the middle there was a witch with a table with a big collection of cards on it. She looked at me and told me that that I should beware of reptilians as they are evil creatures that eat humans. She said that the cards can talk and few cards will move ahead of the others and say what the person needs to hear. The person this was addressed to was the reptilian.

Unfortunately, from the few cards that spoke, I only remember what two of them said. One said that with power comes responsibility and he (the reptilian) should use it wisely. Another card said, that there is only one God and he should turn to him, humble himself and treat others with love and respect, as this is what God wants. Reptilian didn't look very pleased, but he didn't interrupt or say anything either. Then I woke up.


I think this was an interesting dream, although I wish the reptoid would have elaborated more on the origin of his species, but whatever. I also find it interesting, that he represented himself with a bird, which makes sense if you think about it, as birds are reptiles too. 

Few days after the dream, something strange and oddly specific happened. I was walking through the forest by the lake, still thinking about this dream, wondering if there was something more to it. Then I saw a bird of prey flying over the lake. I took a closer look and I'm almost entirely certain that it was an osprey! The timing, the species, it would be a really weird "coincidence". What do you think about this whole situation?

Bitchute starts to become like Youtube(Censored.)
Many good videos on Bitchute were removed.
There was a good video about  Ukraine and Russia being controlled by the same beings, but it was removed by Bitchute.
There was a man who was very good at exposing these reptilians, his channel was removed by Bitchute(The beings who controls Bitchute did it.)
There is no "freedom of speech" otherwise those videos wouldn't be removed by Bitchute.

YouTube is very censored.It was a time when Youtube was a great platform, but now Youtube remove almost everything.Youtube doesn't remove the channels of those celebrities like Logan Paul(Reptilian shapeshifter)who recorded a dead body in Japan. If you show the finger in one of your videos or start swearing, Youtube will shut down your video.
The future of this world will not be a pretty one. We already see the signs that the future will not be pretty.
They want Dystopia! We will be monitored every day, and we won't have privacy, because on the streets will be surveillance cameras everywhere you go.
China is a good example of Dystopia!
All these movies, anime shows us a future were there are only skyscrapers, robots and so on.It will happen one day.This is my opinion, no one is forced to think like me!

Truth

Reptilians hijack your dead body to use as a vessel.
Not many people understood the message of this video about the clown. They say that it's a zombie, but this is not a reference to zombies.
This dead clown that was resurrected havet a brain that he used when started cooking. A zombie wouldn't üç≥.
That house was his when he was alive, but his family wasn't there...a couple  is in his house, he killed the couple and ate them(Reptilians eat humans.)
The clown looked once again alive, he changed his clothes and went outside to see that there are many like him. There are many reptilian hosts and they walk among us.

Reptile Eye

Reptilian Agenda
I figured it out folks.

Reptilians are shapshifters with the ability to hypnotize people with their eyes. They essentially are the top of the Deep State.

The Reasons Reptilians worship the Devil is because they are demons manifested in physical form. They come from an alternative dimension commonly accessed by DMT. In this unusual dimension (that looks like a bunch of geometric shapes working together like a kaleidoscope) exists these demons who have their own leaders such as Moloch or some dragon looking entity. Here's what Moloch would look like in this dimension:

https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4754ca5d8b173fb0a4b932cda2f3e279-lq

These so called demons were originally good beings in a neighboring dimension here on Earth that were helping humanity. Around 200,000 BC, Lucifer rebelled and many of them joined the rebellion causing them to become insane. Insanity is caused by doing harm intentionally and these beings believe doing harm is acceptable in their philosophy.

When they cross dimension, they become a physical version of their interdimensional self so I guess that means they look like Reptilians.

Now consider that Reptilians are running the world government and the Babylonian Money Magic system which is literally the slave system the world is under. 

That means the demons have been running Politics and driving this world into chaos. 

Reptilians need baby blood to continue existing in the physical realm so they try to convert humans who are willing to slaughter children in exchange for money and power. These humans are instructed to become totally evil and to harvest them adrenochrome. The adrenochrome allows the Reptilians to exist or else they can end up going back to their dimension.

These beings hate Love because Love simply destroys their power hence why they attack Love all the time historically. Misery empowers them. They don't have Life Energy because they are so far form God. Life Energy is basically energy that comes from being close to God. We gain Life Energy when we sleep because we are closer to God when we sleep. Babies have more Life Energy due to their purity making them closer to God. Pedos thus commit a horrible act which transfers that Life Energy to the demons to consume and become empowered. They also get energy from dark emotions and death which is why they love misery and war.

They want to make a NWO system where they dictate everything humans do. They see us as their slave force.

They loath Jesus because the small amount of time Jesus spent teaching humans about positive Spirituality caused the Deep State to lose tons of power over us. They used to have a much tighter grip thousands of years ago.

Many celebrities like Nancy Pelosi or Howard Stern have videos of their eyes glitching giving them away as Reptilians. They can't control the eyes sometimes.

Also, their main mind control system is Cell Phone towers plus TV hypnotism and the use of suggestions. That''s how they got people to wear masks for example. They are also behind the MK ultra mind control system. Finally they can mind control by hypnotizing People with their eyes. Their pupils grow wide and reddish. The only way to avoid it is to look away. 

Vampires must be based off these beings. They are blood drinkers. They also like to eat humans but since most humans are poisoned, they still to eating babies. 

These beings also know Karma is real so they always account what they are doing to make bad karma. They try to balance their actions to create good Karma to make up for the bad so they can get away with stuff.

One of these beings on Reddit gave up some info back in 2016. He said the Triangle represents the smallest linear representation of 3D plus it represents Energy, Will Power and Knowledge. He claims demons don't have energy but humans don't have will power so they somehow match up with humanity with these faults. 

All those evil secret societies have been holding this secret for thousands of years. The Monarchs are all high level Reptilians too include Queen Elizabeth.

The Grays are like clones they use to push their agenda. These clones feed in some kind of water tank where they also sleep for 2 hours a day. I don't know much about them though.

A lot of the highest level Nazis and other evil beings are also Reptilian. They like to wear magician hats because they know magic (advanced science), they are sleight of hand tricksters and they are masters of disguise. They often appear as friends but are wolves in sheep's clothing.

They hate Christianity because they cannot push Satanism in a World with Christianity in it. The Shriners red hats represents the blood of Christians.

Their weakness is worldwide love. Their master mind control tool is the media system. Their slave system is money itself. 

Also, when they recuit humans, they often ask them to kill someone they love dearly to prove their commitment which is why so many famous People like Kanye West have relatives who died under suspicious circumstances. When they commit this evil, the Deep State welcomes them into their cult. They often use the shit out of them afterwards too which makes all the money not worth having. They usually work like slaves for the rest of their lives.

What should I call him?

The music isn't good!
I couldn't focus on one of my training because of a song that's called"Enjoy the silence." Here are its lyrics: "All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only harm"
This song shows you that words do harm and most people don't notice the words when they listen to music. It has a subliminal message and goes to your subconscious. Words are indeed unnecessary, we don't need languages, grammar...etc.
we could telepathic communicate, but these reptilians don't want that. YouTube/Alientube has a lot of music in many different languages and most of us don't even understand what that song means. We feel good when we listen to it, but we don't know what it means. They put curses in these songs to keep us on a low vibration.

Reptilians did it again.
I meditated every day for two weeks, but last night I got sick, and I couldn't meditate today. I feel really bad! My stomach is in pain and you can't train in pain, I couldn't sleep all night because I was very sick. Do yoga every day and you will see how they will stop you too. These beings are watching me, and when they see that I am getting better, they get in my way.  

I wasted much time because of them, and I regretted it. If I would be dedicated like I'm now a few years ago, then I would have had more chances of becoming psychic than I'm now because I was younger and more healthy back then, but they distracted my attention. Their Matrix does a great job of stopping us. We humans are just evolutionary tools for them. 
We are born in this Hell, because they want us to receive the programming of their matrix, so it seems that those who are awake don't correspond to their game, so they tried to fix it and make those that are awake be NPC. We are doomed!

Let's talk about Grigori Rasputin.
 Rasputin  had paranormal abilities since he was a child. He could see the future. 
He could calm the animals. 
He could heal people (He was not a doctor)
He was stabbed, and he survived. 
He was poisoned, and the poison didn't kill him. 
He was beaten and shot and still did not die.
 He eventually drowned. But before he died he left a letter to the tsar, and wrote to him that if he was killed by the nobles, then the tsar and his family would die, and they died after two years.
It's very clear that Rasputin was not a human being. 
He was a reptilian hybrid , because only a reptilian can have these psychics powers. He wasn't a Yogi, he wasn't a shaolin monk, but a drunkard and a thief. 
He wasn't into occult either, because he was a Christian, and Christians are afraid of witchcraft and so on. 
Rasputin was the one that allowed Russia to become the Soviet Union. Rasputin could stop Lenin if he wanted, but he didn't. This Rasputin havet a daughter, and his daughter looked like a reptilian too, she was a lion trainer, and most people that can train an wild animal like a lion isn't human. I mean. It's a lion
A human would be very scared to be near lion, lion would feel the fear, and the human would be attacked, but a reptilian shapeshifter make these wilds animals to be pets. 
What it's your opinion about this Rasputin?

Half of all UFO activity is related to the oceans. Legends of underworld beings like reptilians exist in every culture, as well as fables of a hidden utopia made up of advanced beings. Why are these myths so universal, and could these underworld beings be related to UFO activity on Earth?

Reptilian on Howard stern?

It's seem that isn't a good idea to provoke these reptilians.
I had a very bad day! In the morning, these reptilians really pissed me off, I swore, I'm energetically attacked every day. They use the past to make my day not a relaxing one, so today I got very angry with them, and I repeated a few times that it was their fault that I was suffering, which is true. Later came my aunt who is a host for these reptilians , her presence irritated me, she kept insisting that I need to get a job , she said that the job solves all the problems, you realize what kind of person she is, she is a sheep! She's someone who always obey to the system, and today she exposed herself as being  one of them. I said something about nuns, and after a few seconds someone came looking like a nun. And I told her" for a while, everything I say came true, manifest and so on", and she started to find excuses that  psychic powers aren't real, she was a little nervous . These reptilians do not want us to become psychic, so they will say that psychic powers are not real just to keep you away from the occult. After I left her house, I came to a train track, and there were three (Grays come in numbers of three) punks there. Those bastards were just sitting there, I was a little nervous, because there were a lot of stones down next to them, but I kept my composure and moved on. One of them got scared when he saw me , and he said "Hello" and I said "Hello" and left. If they wanted to kill me, they could do it. There were three of them, and they had many stones at their feet, and it was just me and them, there were no other people around. 
It was no coincidence! My aunt who is the host for them irritated me, and then I met three individuals in number of three, and I thought I was going to be killed, and number three is the most mysterious number on the planet. It was no coincidence! Don't provoke reptilians if you're not psychic, I'm not very psychic. I need to meditate more to become more psychic. If you do not want to be attacked by them, then do not insult them, do not provoke them, because you may suffer what I suffered.

Justin beiber turns into a reptile at the airport.
So, about 3 years ago maybe 4, I was at the office working on my computer and this pop up news had a headliner about Justin Bieber turning into a reptile at the airport (in Australia, can‚Äôt quite remember) According to the news he was coming down from the airplane while a lot of little girls were waiting for him because he was about to give a concert there and he starts shifting in front of them. The bodyguards were supposedly trying to block the view from the people and cameras while he was running out of sight. A picture was leaked and was in the article.

I had to close the website because my boss was coming to see some docs on my computer. After about 10 minutes I tried opening the website again but the article was gone. In a matter of minutes. 

Anyone else remembering this?

Singer and reptilian
In the early 2000s there was a webpage devoted to a singer who was having an affair with a reptilian. She was a semi famous singer based in New York. If I remember rightly, she was a jazz singer. She wrote the web page. From what little i remember there was a reptilian who was waiting in her dressing room, he said he listened to her singing and that he found it alluring. I'm sure it wasn't meant to be fiction, but I was a little na√Øve in those days. Does anyone else remember this? I cant find any mention of it anywhere. Browsing this subreddit triggered this memory.

Archons, Reptilians and the cult.
Archons are much older species than humans. We are toddlers and easy to abuse due to our own ignorance. They used to be good beings until they rebelled with Lucifer and became insane. Insanity stems from moving away from God‚Äôs mind. Happiness comes from moving closer to God‚Äôs mind which is Love and the branches of Love (freedom, joy, ect..). Lucifer and the Archons thought God didn‚Äôt exist at one point. They believe in God now because of their research but it‚Äôs too late now because they have become insane. To reverse insanity is a very long process. 

Reptilians are probably some Alien race who are also older than us. It appears some of them do follow Lucifer. Lucifer had about 25 planets following him 200,000 years ago during the rebellion. 

Humans were tricked into following Lucifer but overtime dumped the pagan religions as failed religions except for the secret, underground cults who infiltrated the world from below. 

So imagine the Archons, Reptilians, Grays (mostly clones), and the cult who imprisoned the World. Humans did get crushed under the weight but the pain forced us to evolve quickly to overcome the pain. Now we are now at the start of an evolutionairy step the dark forces fear which is a Spiritual awakening. This awakening brings us closer to God which greatly empowers us so we can no longer be imprisoned. The fluoride and other poisons in the water were meant to slow us down but they can‚Äôt stop evolution completely. 

Those who sold their soul for money may not evolve and have to continue trying. These are those who commit evil for money. Those who tend to aim for good will evolve. It‚Äôs happening now but should accelerate greatly like a snowball effect. 

Then we are free. The evil empires will collapse due of the natural consequences of us awakening. 

This is all interesting stuff I am trying to figure out. The Reptilians are probably among us and are using technology to hide their appearance. They don‚Äôt actually shapeshift. It‚Äôs a tech that alters our mind using cell phone towers. The original beam may be coming from Saturn. The obelisks are also antennas that use quarts and anvil. 

One thing for sure is that our politicians know all about them and never say a word. 

The one thing that is guaranteed is that we can win using good if we know how to plug into God and most of that has to do with focusing on love over fear mentally.
A clue. Riddle.
Some insiders gave clues on how to beat these reptilians or archons. 

These beings are offering us an unbeatable game. The only way out of their prison system is to win the unbeatable game. The only way to win is to not play. 

What is the game? If we know what the game is, we can stop playing it. 

The prison might be made with a DNA alteration long below that shrunk and distorted our senses so we see much less. Not sure though.
Is there just one race of Reptilian beings or more than one? Where do they dwell? What is their agenda?

If any actual real people check this sub, you might find some of these links interesting. However, if you want to do your own researching, let me help point you in the right direction...

Most main stream search engines are heavily censored so finding information can be somewhat difficult. What you need to do is use search engines like: Yandex, Startpage, mojeek, searx, whoogle, seznam, peekier, Okeano, infinity search...unfortunately, a lot of the blogs/sites you find will lead to deleted youtube channels or videos but if you're resourceful enough you can still find them if you find the title to source videos. Then all the good shit starts to come up...obviously you still need to filter through it and built ur own opinion on the subject. There is so much misinformation and conflicting info out there. Its entertaining though...much more interesting (IMO) then any fake bullshit on TV or video game.

Story of Jeffrey Alan Lash, Hybrid alien who was working as a US Agent
EDIT: Why is a bot account u/THM9000 copying and pasting my posts lol

&#x200B;

On 17 July 2015, officers from the LA Police Department made the gruesome discovery of a deceased man inside a car parked on Palisades Drive in the Pacific Palisades region of the city. The investigation into the circumstances of the man‚Äôs final moments began and it didn‚Äôt take too long to establish the identity of the corpse. It was Jeffrey Alan Lash.

At the time of his passing Lash was 60 years old and a local resident of the area. He lived with his long-time partner Catherine Nebron. Further investigation led to some startling revelations about the life of their deceased. The state of the corpse when discovered was a good indicator that Lash had been dead for some time. It turned out that death occurred about two weeks before discovery but was not reported. According to Nebron, Lash collapsed in a Santa Monica parking lot on 4 July and refused to sanction emergency assistance that was clearly required.

Efforts to counter his condition did include dousing him with fresh ice but nothing worked. Lash died shortly after. In accordance with his wishes, both Nebron and her employee, Dawn Vadbunker, placed Lash in his SUV and left for Oregon. The assumption was that Lash‚Äôs employer ‚Äì said to be the Government ‚Äì would retrieve the body. When Nebron returned from this trip, she was surprised to notice that the SUV was still parked in the same place with Lash inside. Vadbunker opted to remain in Oregon without notifying her immediate family. Vadbunker‚Äôs family were so concerned over this that they enlisted the Oxnard Police Department to launch a missing person investigation.

The more detectives delved into the case, the more bizarre things they discovered. A search of Lash‚Äôs home, one of several that he had, turned up a substantial cache of arms. This arsenal of weapons was said to be worth between $500,000 and $1 million. It consisted of over a thousand rifles, pistols, and even bows and arrows. As well as the weapons, detectives also found $230,000 in cash and registration details for 14 vehicles, including the SUV he was found in. This SUV was an enigma in itself, apparently being custom modified for use underwater. Many of the other vehicles Lash owned were reportedly combat-ready.

Lash‚Äôs death might have been a remarkable one. But his life as reported in the pages of the LA Times had the potential to prick the ears of any Hollywood executive. During his life, Lash would tell anyone that listened about how he was an undercover agent for a secret Government Agency. Before moving out in February this year, he would tell his neighbors the same thing. Lash would refer to himself using the alias ‚ÄòBob Smith‚Äô. The Apartment Manager at his former residence would also describe how Lash always dressed in black clothing and would never enter a room without first having it checked. Lash also revealed some of his covert missions for this agency included night swimming to Catalina. He also admitted to a long spell in a coma as a direct result of a gunshot wound to his head.

To date, a cause of death has not been discovered. But a prime candidate is late-stage cancer that he was suffering from. Lash‚Äôs previous home was in Sunset Mesa and the property manager there did report that Lash‚Äôs health was diminishing rapidly. The manager added that the simple act of negotiating stairs would often prove difficult for Lash. Lash believed that his cancer came from exposure to unnamed chemicals that caused nerve damage while he was on a secret mission. Even though the proper cause of death has yet to be determined, it is strongly believed to be a natural death and foul play is not really suspected. Given Lash‚Äôs apparent paranoia and the ongoing investigation, that could well change.

## How Did Jeffrey Alan Lash Amass $5 Million in Wealth

Another curious detail about the life of Jeffrey Alan Lash was the origins of his wealth. There are no reports of anyone ever seeing him work, wherever that was. There was little doubt that he was independently wealthy and was never short of cash. The young Lash had a modest upbringing and studied science at UCLA for a time before he dropped out. At his own request, UCLA kept his records private.

Although the source of Lash‚Äôs wealth has yet to be determined, there is no evidence that he was involved in any form of criminal activity. That could be the result of careful control of facts or genuine innocence in that regard. On the face of it, there is likely only one way to amass a wealth of that amount and that is diligent savings of money earned. Lash‚Äôs former property manager believes that Lash was being honest in his assertions.

Much of Lash‚Äôs life is shrouded in mystery and only came to light when it ended. Were it not for a claim made by Dawn Vadbunker, much of this might have stayed under the radar. Perhaps he would have just been cataloged as eccentric. According to her, Lash once revealed that he was, in fact, an alien-human hybrid that was sent to Earth to assist humanity. Nebron later corroborated this statement. Lash always insisted that he was a government operative, but of what government? How can someone without an apparent source of regular income manage to hoard so many material possessions?

Annunaki/Ancient Aliens
I could decipher any picture of any ancient painting or drawing which is quite simple whether anyone would believe me or not, and state how its depicting that of ancient aliens or reptillians. I've had ma y encounters of sleep paralysis and dreams where I can literally see a shadowy figure inside people of my dreams, I've awakened myself out of the Matrix have figured out mind control is real and now am strongly a targeted individual. These things have been ruling over earth for a long time, they love gold because it's a conductor, which is also in every single cell phone, and sattelites flying in the sky. Which is why the annunaki enslaved sumerians to dig for gold, for there home planet. They control the narrative, Ukraine and russia is a giant psyops but because we are all starting to wake up more they are finding harder to breed fear and loosh of us.
Possible shape shifters

Encounter with Purple Reptilian Shape-Shifting Beings in a Dream (Not Barney I promise)
To start, I tried looking for an applicable subreddit where I could share this experience I had and maybe get a discussion going in the comments to see what y'all think. Also, I wanted to share some of my beliefs that coincide with this story:
 -Reptilians are interdimensional beings
 -When you dream, you travel to the Astral Realm every night
 -These reptilian beings can project themselves into the Astral Realm

(Buckle up because this is going to be a long one...)

With that being said, in this dream I had literally last night, I felt like I was being watched by a race of alien beings that followed me throughout the duration of this story. I've recalled many dreams throughout my life and have had UFO encounters in some of these dreams, but this one sticks out like a sore thumb in my mind. What seemed like a lucid dream quickly turned into a nightmare.

 To set the setting, it was dark out and I was around multiple people at this campsite type area with a pop-up pavillion and a campfire. I was talking to one of my friends that I work with. Mid-way through in a conversation I don't remember, I started to put my hands out in front of me. I could feel this dense pulsating energy between my hands and began creating these green orb-like balls of light. I thought to myself "whoa this is cool" so I began playing around with this "ability" that I had just discovered. Shortly after, I had a feeling I was being watched and proceeded to look over my right shoulder up into the moon-lit sky to see a UFO-type spacecraft hovering about 50-75ft in the air. It almost looked like it had structures on top of it like skyscrapers, it was incredibly weird. 

Then, cut to later in the dream, it's broad daylight now in the same campsite type setting with more people sitting in camping chairs, socializing and talking. A few people I had recognized were all conversing with each other while I sat criss-cross next to one of my friends. Out of no where, I began levitating into the air while everyone around me watched looking confused. I thought to myself that maybe this is another "ability" that I just discovered, as discovering psychic abilities is a common theme for me in a lot if dreams I have. Anyway, what I thought was me levitating turned into me being lifted into the air by some unseen gravitational force, kind of like being slowly beamed up into a spacecraft. The gravitational pull started getting stronger as I started floating around this tall and dark tree with no leaves, just branches. I look to my right to see that this was ALSO happening to another guy that I didn't recognize. He was just as confused as I was that we were floating in the air 25 feet above the ground. All of a sudden, the scenery changes with what seemingly feels like being teleported into a spacecraft.

(Now we're getting to the good part in this long story) 

I come-to, and find myself standing in front of a kiosk-type desk. Now if you've ever been to a classic movie theater and gotten your movie ticket outside at the counter where the person behind the desk speaks to you through a microphone on the window, that's what it felt like. This desk in front of me was all black, and the office behind the bars was very dark and ominous. I appeared in front of a human being sitting down in a chair with short brown hair, kind of chubby. Now it seemed like it was just me and this guy, but it felt like there was two other people there with us that I couldn't see, like they were hiding themselves from me. So I'm talking with his guy when something in our conversation prompted me to say " Well yeah, I'm dreaming right now, and you're in my dream" This is where I started becoming aware of the dream I was having. When I said that, this guy looked at me with a completely puzzled look like his face was saying "What did you just say to me??" He looked shocked. I then said to him, "Yeah that's right, you're a demon..." After saying that, he began shape-shifting out of this human hologram-type form into what he really was to show himself to me. He did not like being called a demon. Next thing you know, there are THREE reptilian-like beings standing around me; one behind the kiosk, one to the left of him, and one standing right next to me. They were around 6.5 to 7 feet tall with purple scaly skin and a reptilian humanoid-like stature wearing a purple cape cloak thingy. I looked at the being to my left to see that his pupils were purple and he had a very strong and menacing energy attached to him, it was very intimidating. They were aware of how spiritually aware I was of what they were and they did not like that. I had basically called them out and they revealed their true form to me. I was incredibly terrified but tried to hold my composure because I could tell they were sensing the fear emanating from me. The reptilian to my left telepathically said to me "mmmm, feeeaaaaarrrr" in a dark Venom-like voice. The only thing I could do was mock him before I began to be constrained by some other-worldly entity and sent off to this underworld type of dungeon level where there were blue little demon babies with horns trying to kill me. 

That is the dream, and a possible encounter I had with interdimensional shape-shifting reptilians, that I had last night. I was terrifying and intense. Let me know what y'all think about it. Thank you for reading up to this point.

heed my warning..
If you value your life, please leave reptilians and conspiracies alone. I type this as I am soon to be homeless. Ive lost everything and no one to save me. My life has been consumed by this topic and conspiracies in general, as well as events in my childhood that set me up for failure. I don't believe ive ever been gangstalked but I feel like my life has been manipulated by some force that I cant explain, Ive been complaining about it for years but nobody cares . Ive made many posts on this sub on many different handles so I'm no stranger to these "aliens".

truth is, there are thousands of these "aliens" here. Politian's, celebrities, and news media...They control everything...Theres nothing u can do about it and no one cares. Sheep are so deep in a brainwash that they cant even comprehend actual reality. TV is also turning their brain to mush.

Ignore all the fearporn you see everywhere, its all bullshit. Enjoy ur life, go to school (although most the shit they teach is bullshit) get laid  (wear protection). If you wanna bring another human slave into this prison planet then more power to ya. Ignore politics, its all scripted and fake. Eat healthy, work out, and stay away from prescriptions.

Find a career you like doing so you dont feel like a slave. don't end up like me, an outcast to society.

&#x200B;

My life started to get really fuckin weird once I got into conspiracies heavy a few years ago. Also after doing DMT several times idk if ive broken my brain, but I permanently see the world different. Its like I can see the simulation for what it is and makes participating in society very difficult. I cant even watch TV anymore, all I see are fucking aliens. They're so obvious to me now...like super blatant

Aliens are living among us and manipulating society. No one gives a fuck....Go enjoy ur life...make friends, network as much as possible, and make some money.

Youve been warned...peace!

Reptilians are demons (or multiple demons in one body)
I have come to discover that Reptilians are actually demonic entities.  The one I am very familiar with is what looks to be a woman.  Behind the outer shell there is nothing resembling human or what would be considered a typical animal (lungs, heart, brain, liver, skeleton, etc). Instead this entity is made up of various spores, waste and other filth several other demons.  There may be some type of tube that has no function ... it's just bizarre and disturbing.

Depending on the entities vibration one of more of the demons inside will manifest itself and the outer human shell takes on the characteristics of the demon.  The human eye won't pick it up, but a camera will.  Change the hue and saturation and a lot of things become apparent.

Other times a hole in the neck or head appears and the demon(s) escape and manifest outside of the dominant entity (the human looking reptilian/demon).  The "shapeshift" is one of more of the demons inside manifesting and changing the human mask, it is not from a "holographic breakdown" or anything like that.    The changes happen almost exclusively in the head, face (eyes especially), neck and upper chest.  Rarely below the waist.

Small story short, this Richard Bruce guy is a youtuber who made several videos exposing reptilians in movies. He also claims to be heavily gang stalked.

There is a reason these daemons are in high ranking positions in all main stream religions.

My encounter
Hello,

I‚Äôve recently stumbled across this subreddit and I am now certain, and thoroughly creeped out, that I looked into the eyes of a reptilian.

In order to protect myself I must omit some details, but here it is;



Years ago I encountered a male who had out of the blue in front of his coworkers pulled out his pocket knife and then start to repeatedly slash his throat, trying to kill himself. By time I got to him he was covered in dried blood, enough to where I couldn‚Äôt read his tattoos on his chest and arms.

He survived. 

Then something happened that has been burned into my brain, something I could describe as feeling almost unreal.

He could not speak (he destroyed his larynx) and had to keep his head pointed down due to his injuries. I got down on one knee to look into his eyes and talk to him. 

As I looked into his eyes I felt hypnotized and like I was looking into the eyes of something‚Ä¶. Primal? More than human. 

His gaze seemed to look deep into my soul. His eyes burning bright, the color I‚Äôd describe as yellow/ amber. I can still feel and see his eyes. 

It was an intense, out of this world experience and we looked into each other‚Äôs eyes for maybe 5 seconds but it felt like we exchanged a lifetime worth of unspoken words. 



I learned a few months afterwards that he annihilated his whole family (wife, both sons and baby daughter), then the family dog before killing himself.
What if
some of us have reptilian dna. The real reason the vaccine is being pushed is because if you don‚Äôt take it, those of us that have reptilian dna are going to start morphing into our true reptilian form. What if the vaccine is allowing the reptilians the ability to hold their form. The vaccine is an adjustment to reptilians .

More issues I have with mr Icke
While I know I‚Äôll get downvoted straight to hell for this   Considering the blind loyalty I see from some on here to David I have a bit of criticism of him namely his theory on the moon being a hologram as someone who has studied space and the solar system as a whole  I do find his. Idea of the moon being a hologram to be completely absurd  for example if the moon were a hologram projected to us   It‚Äôs gravity would be nonexistent as we know in order to have gravity you must have something of a large mass like a star planet moon black hole etc. if the moon were a hologram its gravity would not exist we wouldn‚Äôt see its influence on the ocean unless somehow the oceans are being controlled by humanity to whenever the moon is out and while I do find his theory of the moon being hollow I do think it‚Äôs probable more probable than say it being a hologram we have had rovers and humans go to the moon and shocker it was a material tangible thing we‚Äôve had rocks taken from the moon and brought back to earth that and what are solar eclipses is that another projection I don‚Äôt think so if so early humans must‚Äôve had the technology for thousands of years to somehow make a hologram capable enough and frankly powerful enough to give the illusion of a solar eclipse while I agree early civilization and I really meant was far more advanced than we give it credit for I don‚Äôt think they were advanced enough to create something like that well I do appreciate icke asking questions and isn‚Äôt just blindly following the science like an obedient toady but his skepticism of it has gone from healthy skepticism to ramblings of a madman who would be like in a mental asylum for some of the crap he spews Am I saying he‚Äôs a bad man no do I believe he may be misguided and misinformed most definitely but I just wanted to share some of my critiques and concerns over the blind loyalty I see from Some  not all but definitely some of you towards him  ( I apologize if this came out like crap I‚Äôm on mobile)
Dream in which I met a reptilian, who spoke to me in a way similar to the way an entity on dmt did.
I was around 11/12 years old, pretty introverted, anxious, clingy and weird kid; but one day I had a ‚Äòdream‚Äô that kind of changed everything now that I think back on it. 

When I had it after a while of telling everyone I kinda thought I was crazy and was questioning if it even happened? But then I smoked dmt recently, and had an experience where I broke through and spoke with a feminine purple light who spoke to me by some sort of soul bonding causing a telepathic understanding of each other (best way I can explain it). And this suddenly all clicked, this is almost the exact same way he spoke to me, a little less intimate, more of a telling! Not only that but also in a similar place.

I will now explain the dream:
I find myself in a white beyond white place, almost orb shaped, oogle, orb, ooble, like 4D. I can‚Äôt remember the journey there but this place felt more like an astral projection to another plane than a dream, if not more intense than an experience like astral projection

A tall reptilian humanoid, massive, menacing, in body form, but straight away I felt a weird peace with his presence, 
Then transmitted this/his energy into mine, creating an intense vibration soaring through every single bit of me, creating an INTENSE feeling of power.. along with some sort of mercy. 

similarly to conversation with dmt entities, there were no thoughts, all I was when I was in that place was TO BE, and it was beautiful.

So I feel after this dream, it stayed/always was a part of me (maybe it could be considered the serpents energy?) and there was massive changes that occurred after, but I just chalked it up to puberty. 
I turned pretty damn sadistic, hurting people was fun, being bad was fun, I started drinking and smoking excessively, having sex W dirty sluts jus emotionally manipulating and abusing anything and everything around me. just like‚Ä¶ there was something inside me just waiting to uncoil
And it felt good to uncoil, actually LIBERATING
So why is it that although I‚Äôd rather keep my knowing of this energy, that it also brings along an itch that just can‚Äôt be scratched. 
Should have I of learnt to subject it better and to of not distorted the true nature of the message?
How do I get back in contact with it?

Everyone is talking about the reptilians but no one is mentioning the Mantis beings.
Yes David Icke tells you about reptilians, Vice news likes us to think conspiracy theorists have it from the TV serie V. that is straight up a lie or ignorance.

Reptilians have been mentioned in Sumerian religion or in Biblical beliefs as a dragon or serpent. On top of that, reptilians have been discovered through hypnotic regression done on abductees since 1920's I never knew that until I started doing research on alien abductions.

It's not only the reptiles but also Mantis beings are reported, they seem to be both in charge of a hybridization program. Grays are their offspring and half humanoid, explains their appearance.

[Races been seen through hypnotic regression.](https://preview.redd.it/ju5pe4k8ob681.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=713eafaa1c6a9616c20d2066d45718c96528456f)

The plan is to become fully looking human again through abductions and settle down as the elites in power planning the NWO. This is what hypnotic regression retrieves done on abducted people.

Are reptilians the inhabitants of agartha?
I watched a video yesterday talking about Agartha and or shambala and it sounds very much like a place the reptilians would live. Ancient texts describe the inhabitants of this city as having a bifurcated tongue so they can speak two languages at once. Sounds very reptile like to me lol. It was also speculated it could‚Äôve been the Naga people who live there who very much sound like reptilians to me.

Billy  Corgan talks to Howard Stern  about his reptilian shapeshifting  story.  Youtube will place a wikipedia  disclaimer below this video saying   reptilian's are a conspiracy  theory. Why in the heck do they feel the   need to have such a strange  disclaimer?

Here is an excerpt

Corgan: Imagine you‚Äôre doing something and suddenly you turn around and  there‚Äôs somebody else standing there.

Stern: A different human?

Corgan: Sorta. It‚Äôs hard to explain without going into detail‚ÄìI‚Äôd  rather not go into details.

Stern: But did you say to the person, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you just do here?‚Äù

Corgan: Yes, and they acknowledged it.

Stern: And what did they say they were? From another planet?

Corgan: They wouldn‚Äôt explain.

Seeing reptiles with my eyes closed
For two years now ever since I ate a edible for the first and last time! I've feel like my third eye or something is open. When I "remote view "  or whatever it's called that I'm doing I do it while awake. 

My eyes are closed but I kinda look through the eyelids it's like my eyes are open but they're closed I have to concentrate. I don't think about anything just think about opening my eyes while they're closed and look forward. I have no control of what I see. Sometimes I see objects but the inside of a object like a car steering wheel I see places like a Gothic cemetery and also people it that I get the feeling are from another dimension. These people flash like pictures from a slide show that's fast.
 
I've noticed in the past three months though a entity seems to be trying to block my vision on what ever is in my vision. I can feel it's hate and anger like physically it's awful. The Reptile hybrid looks digital not in the flesh it looks computer generated. I see it as if my eyes are opened. Please help me understand what's going on please.

How do we really know?
This has been a fun sub to follow. One show stopper for me is my following question. If reptilians really have been among us in disguise all this time, then how haven't we figured it out by now? If they really do live like we do, then they too have been in fatal car crashes, accidents, mass shootings and so on. Died in battle or by the sword. If there human form is just an illusion, how can that carry on into death? Where are the autopsy reports? I don't know, I'm probably missing some crucial information that may be able to explain it all.
I've researched the afterlife for nearly 10 years. I am convinced that Reptilian beings are REAL and that the tunnel of light that people see when they die is a trap.

Reptilians are Locusts in the Bible?
Joel 2:1-11

1 **Blow the trumpet in Zion**;sound the alarm on my holy hill.

Let all who live in the land tremble,for the day of the Lord is coming.It is close at hand‚Äî**2**¬† a day of darkness and gloom,a day of clouds and blackness.Like dawn spreading across the mountainsa large and mighty army comes,such as never was in ancient timesnor ever will be in ages to come.

**3**¬†Before them fire devours,behind them a flame blazes.Before them the land is like the garden of Eden,behind them, a desert waste‚Äînothing escapes them.**4** **They have the appearance of horses;they gallop along like cavalry.5** **With a noise like that of chariotsthey leap over the mountaintops,**like a crackling fire consuming stubble,like a mighty army drawn up for battle.

**6** **At the sight of them, nations are in anguish;every face turns pale.7** **They charge like warriors;they scale walls like soldiers.They all march in line,not swerving from their course.8** **They do not jostle each other;each marches straight ahead.They plunge through defenseswithout breaking ranks.9** **They rush upon the city;they run along the wall.They climb into the houses;like thieves they enter through the windows.**

**10**¬†Before them the earth shakes,the heavens tremble,**the sun and moon are darkened,and the stars no longer shine.** \[*See the Fourth Trumpet*\]**11** **The Lord thundersat the head of his army;his forces are beyond number,and mighty is the army that obeys his command.**The day of the Lord is great;it is dreadful.Who can endure it?

They hide truth in video games and movies.

In **Gears of War 3** the main opponent of the humans are the Locust Horde.  The Locust Horde were forced to rise from their underground lairs and invade the surface due to a civil war. The Locust Horde in the game have a Reptilian appearance to them with scales covering their body. Their origin is similar to the Reptilians conspiracy theory.

In **Independence Day** the aliens are called Harvesters and are highly intelligent race that have incredible technology.   "*I saw... its thoughts. I saw what they're planning to do. They're like locusts. They're moving from planet to planet... their whole civilization. After they've consumed every natural resource they move on... and we're next.*" - Thomas J Whitemore. This is what the president said in the movie. I find it weird how they are called harvesters. The Reptilians conspiracy theory talks about Reptilians harvesting humans for their blood because it gives them a euphoric high.

Why did Robert Bigelow say "Aliens live under right under our noses" ?

Can anyone help me?
So out of nowhere I had the urge to search ‚Äú my experience with shapeshifters‚Äù and a video uploaded 8 years ago popped up it was a video about Arizona wilder and an interview she did where she exposed all of the reptilian and shapeshifters in power among us and what they do. Interested I decided to google her death (as any conspiracy theorist does) and found absolutely nothing . Nothing at all about her . Every info page has been wiped clean all except this website ‚Äústeemit. Com‚Äù and the only info I could find was literally what the video told me‚Ä¶.it made my stomach turn . Pls tell me I‚Äôm just looking in the wrong area ???

Hollywood Hints (Jungle Cruise)

I think im a reptilian
A few months ago I decided to do a biopsy because a stupid bet, (not good method to know I almost die because a complicaron) and I discovered that there are parts of my DNA that do not match those of a normal human,

 since I was born I suspected something was wrong with me, my eyes were strange and I saw people with scaly but human skin that nobody the more I noticed in addition to looking too unpleasant, as if they were at the bottom of the disturbing valley Curiously,

 I know that it is not a matter of my autism, since when I spoke with other autists I never noticed anything strange in them or they in me, although they commented that it was rare but not in the same way as neurotypicals

 Seemingly becoming aware of this weakened the mind control already weakened by generations of reptilian-human mixing. 

And that has allowed me to ask myself many questions 

First if they are as powerful as we think and so capable of disguising themselves, how do we come to discover them in the first place? 

Second of all the planets that exist, why did they come to ours? 

Third, your mind control, how can it affect people so far away as to be affected by television? 

Fourth, if they have the ability to vibrate to deceive our senses and it does not harm them in any way, why they would stop doing it? 

But what worries me the most is that one of the people I saw scales on was David icke himself, the author who showed us this

My theory so far is the following

 The reptilians exist, but they are far from having the power that we believe, David icke, a master of disguise among them began to spread disinformation about them so that we believe that they are more powerful than they really are

 I would say they are even weaker than humans based on my own physical strength and ease of getting sick. 

I think the truth is that the reptilians came here fleeing from something worse than want them dead, since the ones I see with that aspect are usually people with anxiety or depression problems, even one had a clear post-traumatic stress disorder 

The funny thing is that apparently they really have mental control but much weaker than it seems, so that we are more receptive they put substances in the food, considering the frequency with which I saw these people with scales I would say that especially in the sweets, 

I suppose that the stimulating ability of sugar makes them work better

 If you want to know if you are a mixed reptilian, the best advice I can give you is to observe your own behavior,

 reptilians being from another planet need to consume substances that humans consider drugs, including things like nicotine or alcohol, these when being consumed by a mixed one, 

they cause greater addiction and the development of traits closer to them, the process takes decades and it is very likely that you will not realize it if you do not leave the sweets completely, assuming that it does not kill you before due to contradictory genes active at the same time or a reptilian in a desperate attack kills you (apparently they also have adrenaline or something similar)

 I am aware of this due to the behavior before the death of a cousin of mine and how his corpse looked, too green and rough for the time that had passed when I found it

 Because of this I recommend avoiding sugar and any recreational drugs, those for medical use do not seem to have an effect if used in the correct dosis and with medical supervision

 The reason I tell you this is because most purebloods are so scared of that alien species or whatever thta is that thing that they can't do anything, to be honest they seem miserable.

 They have done horrible things yes, but they have done them trying to survive like any other species including humans, 

perhaps if we can calm them down and come to their senses we can help them, their enemy from what I have seen although he is very powerful is also very cowardly and is not capable of facing constant resistance as you have done, things like trench warfare in the first world war would be unimaginable for any of them, reptilians are used to flee, that great enemy to win, humans to to persist,

 Let's try at least please

 So first off i have no proof if they were honest, it could have just been some kid with a good scientific background larping, i don't know. I am choosing to believe that they weren't lying, however, and i got some really interesting info from those conversations. If you don't believe that they were real, that's fine, but please don't comment anything negative, just scroll on. If you do however believe they were true, you can ask me about reptilian facts, or if you're knowledgeable in it we could cross reference and see if it was congruent. Cheers, guys!
Reptilians? Ancient Text & Modern Science Conclude We Have 'Skin of the Serpent'!

Curious about this idea
I'm relatively uneducated about the idea of reptilians and I have some questions if you would not mind answering them. 

Does the reptilians theory have any crossover with QAnon? Both are distrusting of the mainstream media narrative and I'm wondering if there are any other comparisons? 

Is EVERY famous/powerful person a reptilian? Does this include youtubers and people like that? Are the Trumps reptilians?

What are the worst parts about the world being run by reptilians? Can you see a future where they are no longer in power?

Anatomy of reptilians
Just sharing this post to create a discussion about different physical aspects of reptilians, not history or origins etc. Feel free to comment any takes that you have, the more the better.
Height: From what I have heard, original reptilians (not hybrids) are about 8-10 feet tall
Weight: No idea, but guessing by height and density maybe about 140-160kg
Fingers/toes: Are they similar to ours or do they have claws like reptile counterparts (crocodiles/lizards)

Dr Fauci glitch on live news? Synthetic skin? Joe Bidens not looking too great either

Weird looking visual effect of droopy skin of Dr Fauci. Or is it something else?

So I kind of had an epiphany with the lacerta files interview & the astral plains. I had heard prior to the reptilian idea that an astral plane is the bigger picture/universe we are apart of. Coexisting realities so to speak with our physical reality. Lacerta talked about that phenomenon. Wild.

Reptilian sex
Okay, I've never had anything like this happen before and I'm a bit freaked out. I was having sex and my eyes where closed. And a flash of a reptilian entered my mind. Like I jumped, I was shocked. It was crystal clear! Like wtf does that mean???
You wanna see a real reptilian ? The main actor of the 2008 crisis. The face, the tongue, the power.

What do you think about Anton Parks ?

Where to start with this belief?
Obviously there's going to be a tonne of trolls in this subreddit, but I was wondering: for someone such as myself who's looking into the subject, where would you suggest I start?

I will be totally honest, I doubt I will change my mind and become a believer, but I'm someone who wants to get educated on the subject. At this current time, it appears as if the theory originated from a work of fiction - so how has it become a theory people actually believe?
Reptilian Technology and Visions of Jesus, God, Satan, Heaven and Hell
People claim to have had visions of biblical places and beings. But what if it's all an illusion created by the reptilians for further mind control. They watch us and if it's especially dying people, they hack into our minds and implant these visions. Also along with the ability to add sensation to them, making it feel more real. I read something about a group known as the Cabal, where unknown people and beings are the true rulers of this Earth. Not presidents and politicians or mafias, but they're probably manipulated by the Cabal to do much of it's bidding. Meanwhile besides from the global problems showing up on the news. The Cabal has unknown classified bases which contain God knows what ( pun not intended). What do you think?
Is this subreddit a joke?
Or do you guys actually believe in reptilian humanoids?

Skid Row ... Reptilian Development ....
We was playing cards round the camp fire - got some nice chunks of tarmac burning from the construction site and we had a good group .,,

&#x200B;

with that couple strangers rocked up , one big guy , the other scrawny , big guy had his hood up and couldnt make him out

&#x200B;

‚Äòwhat you doin fellow ? you can‚Äôt just sit down here without someone vouching for you ‚Äò I stated ‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

‚ÄòCarmelo , drop your hood ‚Äò the little one commanded ‚Ä¶ with that we could all see him , a huge Reptilian Lizard.

&#x200B;

The group jumped back and took stance ‚Ä¶.

&#x200B;

‚Äòhang on hang on , we are not here to cause trouble , we need your help Hojo , there are many of us in the camp ‚Äò with that he let out a high pitched screelling sound and all around others flickered their red eyes , there were dozens of them in Skid Row , on our turf.

&#x200B;

‚Äòman you best be explain yourselfs good , and then get goin ,,, now , what you playing at on Skid Row ?‚Äô

&#x200B;

‚ÄòWe have been working for the celebrates in Hollywood before they discarded us , they have been eating our Reptilian bodies for rejuvination ‚Äò and the scrawny one went on to explain they have been loosing their cloaking abilities ‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

‚ÄòLook , Carmelo show them ‚Äò

&#x200B;

with that the big one broke his finger off and gave it to Jimmy the pit ‚Äò nibble it , it will rejuvenate your broken leg ‚Äò

&#x200B;

Jimmy did indeed put it into his mouth and eat the green finger

&#x200B;

His leg instantly was fixed and he jumped up dancing with his harmonica in his hand , joyful to see

&#x200B;

‚Äònow watch this , show them Carmelo ‚Äò

&#x200B;

Carmelos finger was already growing back.

&#x200B;

‚ÄòWe started as bodyguards to the rich and famous in the movies , but then they wanted more , they used our rejuvinated Lizard properties to keep themselves looking good ‚Äò

&#x200B;

‚Äòand then we were tossed aside , and we ended up on Skid Row ‚Äò Carmelo said as he looked down at the ground.

&#x200B;

‚ÄòSo what you doin tellin us ‚Äò I asked

&#x200B;

‚ÄòWe need your help Hojo , we gotta get out of Skid Row and we need money , we heard you are the guy who runs things ‚Äò

&#x200B;

‚ÄòWell not quite runs things , but I got some moves ‚Äò I replied

&#x200B;

‚ÄòPlease Hojo , speak over here alone ‚Äò , they beckoned me to leave the group and we spoke next to the toilet trees

&#x200B;

The small one stuttered ‚Äò we want you to fight Carmelo Hojo , you know , like you do , for money ‚Äò

&#x200B;

‚Äòwe want you to stage it , you lose the fight , you know everyone will bet on you Hojo to win , but if you fold the fight and let Carmelo win then we can make enough coin to leave Skid Row ‚Ä¶. and you can come with us ‚Äò

&#x200B;

‚ÄòHold on ‚Ä¶ hold on here , you want me to fold a fight ? I aint never lost no fight to no one , never ‚Äò I answered

&#x200B;

‚ÄòHojo that is why it will work , if everyone in Skid Row bets on you , just say $5 a shot then we will have tens of thousands between us

&#x200B;

‚ÄòYou want me to turn my back on my Skid Row family , to take $5 off even one of them would be a crime , that is their drinking money you are talking about , you have no morals Reptilians , now get yourselves out of here by morning ‚Äò my mind was made up

&#x200B;

‚ÄòHojo , please , please , we have no one else to ask ‚Ä¶ ‚Äò and with that he did his second whistle

&#x200B;

‚Äòthis is my wife , Helenia - you can have her Hojo , the finest Reptilian woman there ever was ;‚Äô

&#x200B;

and I have to say this was one mighty fine Reptilian woman , she came and sat on my lap , and as I grinned she asked ‚Äò you wanna see ? ‚Äò ‚Ä¶. see what ? and with that she opened her mouth and pushed out her huge tongue ‚Ä¶. man it was weird. All forked too.

&#x200B;

‚ÄòHojo , you can have her , she is yours , if you will only accept the fight with Carmelo and give us the win , we must earn enough and you are the fixer ‚Äò

&#x200B;

I felt Helenia push into me , ugh ‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs this ‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs this ‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

‚ÄòYou want to see ‚ÄòHelenia asked ?

&#x200B;

With that she stood up and unbuttoned her leather brassier , and yes that‚Äôs what happened , I saw them , I saw all three of them , there were three , three of the finest I had ever seen.

&#x200B;

‚Äòtake her Hojo , she is yours , if only you will accept the deal , you can have her and enjoy her forever ‚Äò

&#x200B;

‚Ä¶.. man , what am I gonna say ‚Ä¶ you know what I said , I gave in ‚Ä¶.

&#x200B;

The Fight is on , we is taking bets now , and Skid Row has never been so excitited , yeah I got Helenia with her three gifts but man I am letting down the people of Skid Row ‚Ä¶.

&#x200B;

I had to do it , I never thought I would find a woman like Helenia gifted with three of them - and I just had too take the fight ...

&#x200B;

I will update you guys after the fight

He is 17 foot tall and has Reptilian armour - bullets bounce off him

It is said he has gone on board the ship so that he can take over the lakes and make a 2nd Reptillian paradise on Earth

The Mysterious Case of Pier Zanfretta: The Man Who Had Several Encounters with Reptilian Humanoids

The Ancient Reptilian Monoliths that have now arrived on Earth .... Ukrainian connection intel
The Ukranian connections have urgently contacted me with intel over the Monolith.

Reptilian in origin - they flew out there to do their tests last night - what they have discovered is

contained below

The material is silver steel on the outside but what is inside the casing is incredible

There appears to be a green liquid - and it is developing , changing forming - a very deep coloured

green liquid - the thermal scale detectors when wildly out of phase when they scanned the object.

One of the Ukrainians Yuri became very dizzy whilst around the monolith and to the suprise of the

shifted

He did an involuntary shift ... not seen before ... he became a reptilian - the team jumped upon him

and injected an anti-rep serum , it put him into stasis and they were able to take him back to the base

and perform a reversal on him.

Google earth has come out showing that the monolith has been in Utah for the last four years ... or

should it be 40,000 years and it has just become activated as my connections have suggested ?

&#x200B;

There is something more .... and it is big - there appears to be a larger Monolith , several larger

Monoliths , the Ukranians have said they are on the ocean floor

&#x200B;

They are on a boat out there now and the aim is trying to open the case which holds the liquid.

Reptiliian War Crimes
By altering my CB radio and increasing its frequency range you can pick up another new bandwidth - by tuning its frequency right up you can hear high pitched noise - at first it sounds like hiss - but what i discovered is it is actually the Reptilians talking.

By putting the dialogue into a computer I was able to transpose the high noise down and what I discovered is amazing.

Anyone can do it and tune into the Reptilian bandwidth. Its on 778.88.7 bandwidth.

There are Reptilian juggernaught ships on their way to Earth , they have put down these monolith points like the one in Utah and they are homing beacons for ships. Similar monoliths have been put in NYC , Paris and Moscow and many other cities.

One of the ships , the mothership has a time signiture diameter of a whole city - its that big.

When I first tuned in I thought it was just white noise but no ... by tuning it downwards you can hear the whole dialogue of the Reptilians - I was also able to tune into the Reptilians on Earth and locate some of their bunkers.

Yesterday I went to investigate one of the signals - it was coming from near a pawn shop local to me.

I knocked the door of the shop and a strange man opened the door - once inside i could tell that the shop had something going on.

I asked to see the manager and the man acted strangely , so I made myself inconspicuous.

I just browsed the shop and hid around one of the aisles , after closing time i remained in the shop and quietly let the shop keeper leave , he locked up and i was alone in there.

Carefully i pulled out my handheld CB radio , I tuned it in to the high frequency and i could hear the Reptilians plotting something.

I followed the signal by extending my arm , this made the signal either clearer or more faint - and by pointing towards the counter i could get much clearer reception - which led me to decide i should go behind the counter , slowly i opened the door behind the shops front - and with the cb radio i could hear a whole room of Reptilians talking from behind a door.

I pushed the next door , just a little , i didnt want them to hear me ...

Thats when i saw them , they were all sat round a table , gambling , they had chips like in a casino and the air was full of cigar smoke and each had a bottle of moonshine and there were Reptilian prostitutes next to them.

I knelt down and slowly pulled out my cassette recording device which I had previously bought for evidence. I gently clicked the record button.

I got a cramp in my arm from sitting so awkwardly and then my arm knocked a broomstick over next to the cleaning cuboard and with that one of the Reptilians jumped up and said ' whos there ?'

I ran out of the store and when i got to the door pulled at it but it was locked.

I didnt know what to do and in a panic I picked up a TV set and smashed the window - I made my escape on foot , running down the back alley - looking behind me there were 6 Reptilians sprinting towards me , luckily they were so drunk that they could not catch me.

I climbed a wire fence and there was no chance they would catch me

I returned back to my underground base and told the others what I had discovered , at first they were questioning me , but then i produced my tape recordings - its just hiss they said when i hit the play button - but then i put it into the computer and downtuned the recording - the Reptilians were on tape and everyone was listening to it intensely.

They were talking about the mothership landing and the location beacons - i had it on tape , all of it.

I will be using the radio to find out more later , i must be more careful next time as i nearly got caught by the Reptilian last night.

YouTube: Reptilian Shapeshifter Shapeshifting In Drug Commercial

Reptilians drugged me
The reptilians came after me, they could imitate anyones voice and also shapeshift into different human forms. It started with dogs barking around my apartment, then they lured me to my neighbours where they were very kind and gave me some wine to drink and also food. After i went from there i went to sleep but did not wake up to my alarm. After that when i woke up a later time i were some where else in a world that looked the same. Men with very blue eyes started chasing me around and poisoned everything i ate. Eventually Police captured me and took me to a cell where they would feed me as dog food. Then they did t and they took me to a doctor where he injected something into my nose. After that everything went black and I woke up in the hospital with an altered reality.
JON MOXLEY REPTILAN PROOF

Reptilain Hideout

Theory about a reptilian Illuminati/secret cabal
I have a theory about the potential truth of 'reptilians' controlling human society. That sounds rather hammy of me, but I think my theory holds real merit and that I'm onto something even if it's purely speculation at heart.

I'll keep it simple:

The earliest known human civilization started around the Ubaid period, about 6000-5000 BC. Isn't it bizarre that after millions of years of stagnation there was this change? It could be because we stopped being hunter-gatherers and opted for settling/farming. I have a very different idea.

You can look up the Ubaid Lizardmen statues on Google Images. These are artifacts dating back to the period/area depicting humanoid characters with elongated faces, big slitted eyes and another elongation on the backs/tops of their heads. There are also the Japanese Dog≈´, prehistoric idols in a very similar vein. I think these statues aren't just ornaments or deities but a depiction of the reptile race that seeded humans or at-least human civilization.

This may sound ridiculous, but Kyle Odom is my trump card. His manifesto can be read at: [https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2754139-Kyle-Odom-Manifesto.html](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2754139-Kyle-Odom-Manifesto.html)

This could easily be dismissed as the diary of a schizophrenic, but I'm certain there is more truth to it than meets the eye. Odom speaks of unpleasantly discovering a race of 'amphibian-humanoid from Mars'. He makes bold claims about them being millions of years old/advanced, living underground and controlling their own bred human flesh puppets. He has a long, dedicated log of them impersonating humans, hiding through the church, harassing him with 'telepathy' and revealing individual parts of their true face/appearance to him. Pretty stereotypical reptilian paranoia.

This is where some of the previously mentioned stuff comes back up. Odom's drawing of a 'martian' is uncannily similar to the Ubaid/Kogu statues. There is this and the bizarre fact that most fully-fledged human civilization inexplicably came about in the past few thousand years, Odom's suggestion that the creatures were responsible for religion/the Bible, their use of religion as some kind of medium combined with the legendary story of a serpent giving mankind knowledge. What I'm trying to say is, did these supposed reptilians seed civilization? Did they somehow give us the knowledge or other requirement to grow into civilizations and could they have delivered this to humans in different continents given how we have known indigenous civilizations in other parts of the world? Mythology about dragons and snakes is also ubiquitous in different cultures. It's not unbelievable they could reside deep in the Earth, think of how unexplored the ocean and ground underneath us is as we live exclusively on the surface.

Most skeptics would be pressing for evidence but Odom does specify that his 'martians' have a tactic for blending in that makes them virtually unknowable, and that he shot Remington to draw attention to what he experienced. Some other correlations are David Icke's claim to having an epiphany in a similar vein to Odom with his meditation- quite literally:

"He claims that an inter-dimensional race of reptilian beings called the Archons (or Anunnaki) have hijacked the earth, and that a genetically modified human‚ÄìArchon hybrid race of shape-shifting reptilians known as the Babylonian Brotherhood, the Illuminati, or the "elite", manipulate global events to help keep humans in constant fear." from Wikipedia. Are we possibly just livestock for these rumored creatures?

One last little nugget of conspiracy I thought would be good to bring up is the Illuminati Card Game. There are many cards that people see as representing or predicting real world events, but the Orbital Mind Control Lasers card in particular depicts a face in what is undoubtedly the likeliness of Kyle Odom himself. Keep in mind this was published years before the shooting and his manifesto.

In a world wracked by political propaganda and this side/that side logic I feel like this realm of information has been lost or dismissed. I think the world is far stranger than we give it credit for. I would welcome any discussion or debunking.
Kardashev scale/Relationship to other species
Whereabouts on the Kardashev scale are Reptilians believed to be? I have only ever encountered Arcturian aliens, my ‚Äòapparent‚Äô starseed (I‚Äôm not sure whether this is still just my dreams but I didn‚Äôt even know anything about aliens or the word Arcturus beforehand). Are they more or less advanced than these aliens, and if so, where are they placed? Also, do the Reptilians know of the existence of all the other kardashav 2 and onwards civilizations, and is there some sort of Cold wars going on where the peaceful but more powerful aliens don‚Äôt destroy the Reptilians because of their principals to the protection of precious life forms.

Hojo was mining in Australia , he had bought a claim within the Opal mines

&#x200B;

One day , he had drilled a hole deep , only to find a cavern , and beyond that a entrance , 

&#x200B;

being an explorer ‚Ä¶. Hojo , well , explored.

&#x200B;

What he found next will again be questioned by you and probably you will try to debunk this.

&#x200B;

He came across a wall of Emerald and of course being a miner began hacking away at the rare emerald stone.

&#x200B;

Then the wall of Emerald broke in two - and he was faced by a second entrance , this time the walls were covered with a language he could not discern - it was of course later to be understood as Reptilian writings , but Hojo did not know this.

&#x200B;

Whilst exploring these new foreign tunnels he went ever deeper into the Earth and after many days came upon ....

‚Äò The Archives ‚Äò - ‚Äò The Vaults ‚Äò

&#x200B;

Here upon were the findings of Hojo and his resource of Reptilian footage and Reptilian photo stills.

&#x200B;

Many years later I fell lower in my standards and began living on Skid Row - it is from here that I have now decided to share my Reptilian footage and there are many of you that choose to question its authenticity.

&#x200B;

I can guarantee that these are real Reptilian photos and I will continue to access the Archives and bring more footage from the vaults for you all.

Reptilian film - The Slime People (trailer) 1963

Has anyone watch the TV Series "V" 2009? Im shocked with its congruence to the world we are living now. It exposes it all, From Vaccines to controlling our perceptions by Media. Now I see why the network shut it down, we are living this story. Believe it or Not, its a tough one to swallow. Research

The Final Reptilian Post From Me - Mission complete
Adrift for days , I anchored the boat , water was leaking everywhere , the engine had cut out fully

&#x200B;

Needed a rest , where was I ?

&#x200B;

Icebergs everywhere , freezing , only my ‚Äòshine to warm me up.

&#x200B;

Stood on the boat it was so silent ... occsional Icebergs broke - then it was back to silence

&#x200B;

What was I doing here ? Was I really gonna find these Reptilians ?

&#x200B;

Needed some skid row inspiration

&#x200B;

Popped one of Kennys special smokes into my dry lips and fired it up

&#x200B;

Blew out the sweet blend and thats when they appeared

They had been infront of me all the time ... Cloaked

&#x200B;

The smoke swirled around them and gave them form

&#x200B;

'Reptilians - there you are' I screamed

With that a good dozen of them de-cloaked ...

&#x200B;

'Take me to your leader , now !!! ' I roared

&#x200B;

I grabbed my harpoon gun and  marched them onto the Iceburg

&#x200B;

'Take me to your leader ... NOW !!! '

&#x200B;

I could tell they were scared ...

&#x200B;

I wanted more fear so I prodded one of them in the back - 'owww no , dont , dont ' he pleaded

&#x200B;

haha , cant take the man outta skid row

&#x200B;

So there I am in an Ice cave

It was an Emerald cave , the great Emerald tablets were displayed in a case in front of me.

‚ÄòWhat are they I asked‚Äô

‚ÄòThe history of your world‚Äô The Master Reptilian replied.

'oh ... got anything else ?'

&#x200B;

With that he called out and 3 mermaid like Reptilain women stepped from the shaddows

I centered my eyes on the most beautiful looking Reptilian , her slit eyes pierced mine

&#x200B;

'whats its name?'

'her name is Cassandra' the tall Reptilian replied

&#x200B;

'give it to me' I gasped

'and you will be on your way human?'

&#x200B;

'yeah ok ... but my ship is fkd - your gonna have to give me another vessel to get back to Skid Row

&#x200B;

'That can be done - as long as you go - you must leave human

&#x200B;

I agreed  'give me that Reptilian woman and a new boat and its a deal'

&#x200B;

'Then we must join these two in union' - The tall one bellowed !

&#x200B;

'Will you take this Reptilian Wife and honour for now until forever ?' He asked

&#x200B;

'yeah like let me have a go on it , i bin at sea for days man' - I giggled

&#x200B;

Cassandra looked at me with that sly look , kind of viscous , like i did shiver when i looked into her slit reptoid eyes , man she was hot.

&#x200B;

The Master Reptilian looked at me with disgust ‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

‚Äò And so it be , Let the Human take the Reptilian in matromony'

&#x200B;

We joined hands and wandered out into the freezing cold , 3 Reptilian guards walked behind us ...

&#x200B;

I was taken down to the Iceburgs shoreline and presented with my new boat

&#x200B;

The Master Reptilian spoke ...

&#x200B;

'This is the Nautilus submarine - You will travel the ocean and protect Atlantis - as has been the duty of the Reptilian Athousis for centuries'

&#x200B;

Now this is your job with your Reptilian wife Cassandra

&#x200B;

You are the last True Bum - You will hoover the ocean floor Bum - You will always be down there - protector of all , You are The protector of Atlantis now - go forth with good steed.

&#x200B;

And so it is today I watch the ocean , driving Nautalus at top speed , watching the mermaids and discovering the secrets of the Reptilians.

&#x200B;

I ride the Nautilus , forever the protector of Atlantis.
So many Martian rocks shaped like Reptilian skulls cannot exist in the same place, especially one being dragged into a hole by a frog-like humanoid! Why does this remind me of some "election" somewhere?

What does the Reptilian Biden Presidency mean for the USA??
So the creep Biden has managed to steal the election..I once saw a video of him..in a photo op with the family of some senator or somebody...the way he was fondling that guys teenage daughter..I knew that sec he was Reptilian Pedophile scum..feel sad for Trump...
So guys what do you think is in store for the USA the next 4 years? Civil war? WWIII?

Day 1 - Voyage to the Artic - Reporting In
Hi Guys

26 hours in now ‚Ä¶ things are not going good ‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

Rewind first

Jimmy The Dog fixed me up with the boat  - what i got is a small tug boat , rust bucket and cold as shit 

Still its meant to be an Ice Breaker - really don‚Äôt feel it - and not going to be risking that once I get there.

&#x200B;

Its weird just sat in the cabin , standing at the ships wheel is just surreal - one of those old school wooden spoke ones.

26 hours now and I‚Äôm just following the compass North to the magnetic pole.

Thought it would be harder but its straightforward.

Its lonely out here though 

&#x200B;

One minute it was the troubles of Skid Row , the noise , the police , the fighting , now its the 10 foot waves hittin the deck of the ship. 

Got a small set up below the viewing cabin , small tv with a video player - few films Im gonna watch.

Gettin moody to be straight with you. 

&#x200B;

Went to sleep , but telling you sleep out here is harder than on Skid Row - man you can have some rough nightmares on Skid Row but this is worse. 

I was seeing sea monsters , sea squids , huge sea squids and they was like just gettin under the boat and tippin it up. Heavy dreams , not good.

&#x200B;

Anyway , early days , slow headway. 

&#x200B;

Long way to go - still only day one.

&#x200B;

Will update you guys when I got some more news ,

&#x200B;

Feels like weathers really hitting it out there tonight - ships really taking a battering from the sea

&#x200B;

Got my SatNav phone that Kenny picked up for me so I‚Äôm all good for the Comms,

&#x200B;

Cheers Guys
Skid Row and The Reptilians
Skid Row , Been here half my days 

Yep , got deluded and thought I was running the mines on Alpha Draconia 

Yep , got deluded and thought I was fighting real Reptilians when actually it was steroid freaks in the ring with masks on

Yep , got deluded and thought I was gonna get myself famous for exposing the Reptilians

&#x200B;

So here I am , another cold morning on Skid Row , at least the internet connection is working and I got the Reddit to speak to my gang

Got up this morning , had a hit , little flask of moonshine from my Betty , she‚Äôs all going on about the Reptilians now ...

I started her off and now she won‚Äôt stop , she‚Äôs seeing them everywhere , wants me to do a full search of the tents as she says she‚Äôs got intel that they have set up base in Skid Row. I keep telling her it aint real , Betty , they aint here on Skid Row but she aint havin none of it , 

‚Äò They is here , I tellin you , I can hear them at night , they aint speakin english , they is all speakin in code ‚Äò

There aint no tellin her - it aint real - they aint here - she aint havin none of it.

&#x200B;

I gotta tell you guys somethin - stuff from my last fight - stuff I discovered,

Went back to the venue my last fight was held

I broke in at night and saw the control room - load of monitors - they bin streaming it across the world on the internet - taking bets on it - makin money , makin me look like a fool. Even had a name for me they broadcast  ‚Ä¶ 

‚Äò The Bum ‚Äò , a sicko poster of me in Skid Row and how I thought I was fightin Reptilians - they was mocking me - makin me a fool.

The Reptilian fight club I was involved in was never Reptilians - It was humans dressed in Reptilian masks.

And so it goes on , I gotta come to terms with things 

Gotta come to terms.

Gotta come to terms.

&#x200B;

Yeah its a big thing I tellin you , typin now from me tent - sippin me 'shine

One good thing , they paid me , paid me good for the last fight - 10k - nice fresh notes

And that 10k ? I aint gonna fritter it away on Skid Row - hell - you can spend 10k in a week on Skid Row if you aint careful - pay for the guys to get some rooms in some hotels to live it up , buy everyone a weeks drinkin juice - some smokes.

I aint doing that ‚Ä¶..

&#x200B;

I be gettin me a boat - I put the deposit down - 5k - 2 weeks rental.

Long voyage , voyage to the deep , voyage to the centre of the Earth‚Ä¶.

&#x200B;

So yeah - I‚Äôm doin it.

&#x200B;

I‚Äôm off to the Antarctic - I‚Äôm gonna see what all the fuss is about

They be Reptilians up there - there be the base I bin hearin bout hopefully

Prob take me a few days as I aint no sailor and aint got no exp with these digital maps 

Just gonna use me nose , got me round the streets ok , know every back alley round Skid Row 

I be sailing the seven seas 

&#x200B;

So anyways whilst many you‚Äôs had me down as a fool , knocked me here , called me things ‚Ä¶ 

I doin it 

Me n Betty been down Market Basket - got me a lotta tins , Betty be makin me sandwiches , lotta tinned ham , plenty of juice from Kenny been made for the voyage.

So that‚Äôs it guys - I maybe a fool to you - but I never stopped searchin for the Reptilians

&#x200B;

I for one welcome our new Reptilian overlords
Hojo buddy save me a spot on your ship
A Reptilian Photo ( from the private Historical Archives )

The Artic and The Reptilian connection
How many of us have actually navigated a boat to the Artic circle to see the Reptilian homeland ?

&#x200B;

Last year a friend and his brother chartered a lone boat to the Artic , took weeks to arrive , to a place no tourist boat goes.

&#x200B;

Upon reaching the glaciers they saw groups walking around , at first they thought they must be explorers

&#x200B;

But upon holding binoculars they saw a sight they could not believe , there were groups of Reptilians all over the place

&#x200B;

Fishing , doing sports , driving land crafts and observing the constant flow of saucer traffic arriving each hour.

&#x200B;

So my question is who else has taken this journey ? Journey to the Artic ?

&#x200B;

If I were to rent a boat , would I be likely to see the groups which my friend report ?

&#x200B;

Would I be likely to find a base ?
Hidden in plain sight?

People still wont believe this even tho they seen this video

Why yall think elon musk wanna go to mars so badüòÇ he tryna escape judgement day when the anunnaki return

Cage fighting a Reptilian - real footage

Are there reptilians that don‚Äôt know that they are?
Do they ever figure it out?
My rematch in the ring with The Reptilian.
A lot of questions about the Reptilian Fight Club , a lot‚Ä¶.

So I had my fight , wasn‚Äôt easy , wasn‚Äôt fair , wasn‚Äôt supposed to be ‚Ä¶

Pick up was at 11pm , the same old Datsun van , man I wasn‚Äôt ready for this ‚Ä¶ I was still drunk.

Bin drinking all day , heck all week. And there I was stumblin into this van in the pitch black to fight a Reptilian.

'Man you don‚Äôt look so good‚Äô the driver murmered

‚ÄòShut it , I got Reptilian scores to settle‚Äô I snapped‚Ä¶ ‚Äò Drive ‚Ä¶ you aint paid to talk , drive ‚Äò

&#x200B;

Got to the gates , big old fancy mansion house , well it had to be , it was my rematch , they had upped the clientele.

Two suited bouncers on the door , big guys , I could‚Äôve taken them , but hey , it aint about them , but still don‚Äôt like the way they eyed me up like some kinda bum.

&#x200B;

The place was empty , couldn‚Äôt hear anything , got changed in the cloakroom , what kind of outfit was this ? like gold shorts with a red a top , I aint wearing this , customised my own outfit , tore my sleeves off my shirt and ripped my jeans in half to give me something I could work with in the ring.

And that was it , a red light went off in the cloakroom , a guard nodded and I was brought out to the fight room , was looking forward to the crowds.

I‚Äôm walking through the corridor ‚Ä¶ picturing the screaming crowds , the packed stadium ‚Ä¶.

But then I hear it ‚Ä¶ I hear it ‚Ä¶ The silence ‚Ä¶

Finally I hit the end of the corridor ‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

The room is empty , Just the octagon ring with one lone robed figure stood with his back to me

I was astonished , and then he whispered ‚Äò Come hither ...‚Äô

errr i thought , i was shaking my head , still hungover ‚Ä¶ I had to ‚Ä¶ I just had too -

&#x200B;

‚ÄòReptilian , I have come here ‚Ä¶ to fuck you up‚Äô - with that he span his head with a 360 degrees spin

&#x200B;

I ran , no sprinted to the ring - 

5 rounds , like nothing ever before 

a true brawl , a reptilian vs a human

i thought he had me in round 4 ... could i go on ... i had too

it was round five my punching power was back , my timing was exact

i finnished him , i won ... i always knew i would ....

&#x200B;

I looked round the darkened stadium , no one was there ‚Ä¶ then there was one man mans lone clapping ‚Ä¶.

&#x200B;

it rang out ‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

‚Äòwell done friend ‚Ä¶ and now your prize ‚Ä¶ what do you want for your prize , name it ‚Äò he said

My head rushed through the options , an island ? a sports car ? a new home ? I could have it all.

&#x200B;

And then I said it

I said it

&#x200B;

‚Äò I want to be Reptilian ‚Äò

&#x200B;

‚Äò I want the full conversion ‚Äò

&#x200B;

‚Äò Make me Reptilian ‚Äò

Back On Skid Row - Where have The Reptilians Gone ?
Alone I woke , the Reptilians ? Gone ‚Ä¶ 

Alpha Draconia ? Gone ‚Ä¶

I had never left Skid Row ‚Ä¶ Benny was whinning next door , his tent was open , puking into a bucket as he always did

‚ÄòReptilians‚Ä¶ Reptilians‚Äô where are they I shouted ‚Ä¶ where‚Äôs the Reptilians ‚Ä¶ my wife Deoria ? Where is she ?

I heard a groan next to me , it was Betty , oh god , she‚Äôs so fat I thought - if only she could shapeshift , look at the state of her.

She found her dirty knickers and was off on her way.

&#x200B;

I opened my tent and went for a walk - but where were they ? Where were The Reptilians ?

Again I was screaming for them ! Take me back to Alpha Draconia ‚Ä¶ TAKE ME BACK !!!! TAKE ME BACK !!!!

The Police siren rang out as they did a swoop across Skid Row

I ran and climbed a wire fence , found Jimmy and Terrance - they beaconed me in , gave me a hit.

As I sat back I could not get the Reptilians off my mind , Jimmy was swigging some whiskey , cheap stuff , it burned.

Got some advice , it was all in mutters and slurs but at the end of it my buddies told me what I had to do ‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

Get myself back on my feet , ‚ÄòIf these Reptilians are real you gotta get em man ‚Äò - ‚Äòok Benny what do I do ?‚Äô

‚ÄòYou get back out there and fight , you fuck em up man , that‚Äôs what you always bin good at, you can fuck up anyone man‚Äô

So later I knew I had to get myself back in shape , find the underground fight club , show them , find them , kill them , all.

I ripped my shirt off , bare chested , a bit baggy maybe , food was never good round here.

&#x200B;

‚ÄòCome on fuckers who‚Äôs first ?‚Äô

I hated Kenny and saw him from the corner of my eye , he shuddered , scared stiff - ‚ÄòYou , you ‚Ä¶ you‚Äô I screamed ‚Ä¶

Ran over , kicked him sideways ‚Ä¶. the fists rained down , yeah he was easy opponent ‚Ä¶. not fair you say ? hey its kenny , don‚Äôt worry ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs had it coming from me for a long time 

I sat down and Betty came over and handed me a little drop of moonshine , felt lifted ‚Ä¶ Now where are these fucking Reptilians ? I want some ‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

Wandered in to South land ‚Ä¶ walked for miles ‚Ä¶ people stayed out of my way , walked across the street ‚Ä¶ I did have my shirt off and hey I got a lotta cuts 

Heard a whistle ‚Ä¶ ‚Äò hey ‚Ä¶ Jack , Jackie boy ‚Ä¶ ‚Äò and that‚Äôs when I saw HIM standing at the door of the bar ‚Ä¶ I knew him ‚Ä¶ I knew him , it was ‚Ä¶ it was HIM 

The one who took me in , the one who started all this ‚Ä¶

'You want to get back into it ‚Ä¶ some money ? ‚Äò

‚ÄòMeet me tonight ‚Ä¶ back here , get yourself together‚Äô - he looked me up and down ‚Äò Your good , your good‚Äô

&#x200B;

So as I sit here this afternoon , I‚Äôm drinking, real heavy ‚Ä¶ I gotta see them again , everything that‚Äôs happened to me ‚Ä¶ I need to see the ring again , the shifters , the Reptilians ‚Ä¶

What the fuck has happened , what am I doing back on Skid Row ‚Ä¶ I should be on Alpha Draconia in charge of the mines.

Anyways , hitting a few bags , punch bags that is ‚Ä¶

Tonight I will find out what really is going on ‚Ä¶.

Meet the fight club again ‚Ä¶ be a champion , fight for us all , become a winner , I‚Äôm no loser ‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

Anyways back in the tent , need some kip before the pick up tonight.

The Reptilian 3rd Surface
For many years I have been involved with the Reptilians

&#x200B;

Many of you have been opened to my accounts of the underground fight clubs operating in most of the main cities now. Ex Special forces and Ex MMA make up the mainstay for the tormaments - It is embarrassing to see there are now ordinary folk competing in this incredibly dangerous sport. I have seen too many good people not walk out of the fight rooms.

&#x200B;

I later told you of my groups capture of a reptilian and his return to his mothership , I was of course rewarded with a lot of money - but I was rewarded with far more ‚Ä¶ their trust.

&#x200B;

I have released the records , showing the 24th to be the pinnacle date .

&#x200B;

As many of you now know I work for the Reptilians and have a Reptilian wife - ‚ÄòDeora‚Äô - the finest Reptilian woman was given to me.

&#x200B;

I let you know of my new home , I even named it , I told you of Alpha Draconia

&#x200B;

My life on Draconia is of question to many of you , many of you are angry with

&#x200B;

me that I work the salt mines , using the humans to search for minerals ,

&#x200B;

the minerals the Reptilians hold so dear.

&#x200B;

Whilst here on Draconia I look from my window and I see a burning land , on fire , scorched earth ‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

I do not wish to return to Earth , many of you still send me offensive messages , 

but you know what ? 

Your not the guy running things on Draconia , Your not the one with the shape shifting wife , 

Your the one who‚Äôs stuck on Earth 
Alien or Reptilian?

Finding happiness on Alpha Draconia
It has been sometime since I made Alpha Draconia my home.

&#x200B;

I was accepted by The Reptilians because I had been a traitor to my own kind.

&#x200B;

I had sold out the people of Earth and as my reward was given the finest shape

&#x200B;

shifting Reptilian woman on Draconia

&#x200B;

My days were never the same , I always had a new woman at my side , she would 

&#x200B;

shift during the night and upon wakening she would always break my dreams

&#x200B;

I would never have to work the Reptilian salt mines , you see , I had brought enough

&#x200B;

humans to Draconia to work under me , my days were spent in the observation 

&#x200B;

tower , If I saw a human slacking I would think nothing of administering Electron 

&#x200B;

shock treatment.

&#x200B;

Of course when I first moved to Draconia I thought of them as my new friends , 

&#x200B;

they were better than humans , they always gifted me things , made me live in 

&#x200B;

splendour when previously I had been living on Skid Row ‚Ä¶ ahhh Skid Row , I can‚Äôt 

&#x200B;

believe how many years I spent on there.

&#x200B;

And now I sit , in my apartment , luxury apartment , I look out accross the fires of 

&#x200B;

Draconia , the whole place is on fire ‚Ä¶ we have new humans arriving this afternoon 

&#x200B;

and I must give them their induction , take them to the mines , watch over them.

&#x200B;

Do I feel guilty ? That I am a traitor who has Reptilian masters ? 

&#x200B;

The simple answer is No ‚Ä¶ the Reptilians have given me things I could never have 

&#x200B;

asked for , I will never say sorry to the humans , I will only thank the Reptilians for 

&#x200B;

all they have done and the power that I continue to yield.
Old Julia Roberts video showing sharp teeth
So back in my early conspiracy days, I stumbled upon a YT video of Julia Roberts shifting her regular perfect teeth into clear as day sharp "reptilian" teeth and it was incredibly damning and disturbing video evidence of shapeshifters among us. 

Has anyone ever seen this video? I was recently looking for it and it seems like its been completely scrubbed. All I managed to find is a pinterest screenshot of now deleted vid.

If anyone has it saved by chance I would love to retrieve it.
Share your Reptilian Evidence - We ought to all have something!
I would like to see people spread some information about Reptilians and why you think they are real. Whilst proving detail and links to other sources as well. That way we can all possibly learn something new.
Roman Reigns Reptilian Magic (POWERED BY SATAN)

Call to love
The sooner humans and reptilians realize that we complete eachother on earth and the snake of the world was their conciousness nd psyche. I believe that humans and reptilians were sent here on earth to learn from eachother as they lack love and we lack spirit/psyche. Isnt it so odd how the join or die symbol is a cut up snake? Nd what of the ouroboros; why does it eat itself? I believe we've been deceived into fighting eachother by other negative beings who thought they could take earth too but little did they know that theres a lot of love on earth and love heals all. Even they will return to the source in time because they realize how weak negativity is in comparison to positivity. Light transforms and engulfs all. Peace and love to all beings :)

This week I report on the underground phenomina of the hunting grounds

These have been reported to take place each month in both the Artic and the South American jungle.

Sound like anything you know ? .... Predator perhaps ?

Yes thats right 

Reports have come in from multiple sources that people are being tracked by Reptilian visitors and they are hunted with like sport ... 

Does this mean that the televised film version of Predator was infact based upon a very real game which has been going on unreported for millenia ?

We are asking for more of you who have had to go through the gauntlet to step forward and report what goes on .... we need the reports to build a counter protection team.
A Lot of De Cloaking of Reptilians this month - what is going on ?
The most ancient species of the Reptilians have been de cloaking - in all kinds of spaces

I was in a shopping center today and saw 3 Reptilians de cloak in plain site - they didnt even seem to care about it 

One  was by a water fountain and through the trickle of water he de cloaked -  it was magnified by the effects of the water mist and i think this was intentional.

I stood there in  amazement , stunned to see it de cloaked - it starred at me and then  this wry grin grew on the side of his face ' you see something ' ? the  freak asked ...

Man , I just ran and as I went to the glass door the shopping center assistant de cloaked and again grinned

Freaked I ran to the other door at the opposite end of the shopping center , whilst running I slipped on some water where the Janitor had been mopping the floor , whilst on the floor the janitor reached out and I heard 'anything I can do for you sir' , as I looked up it had fully de cloaked - full reptoid staring at me

I was so bothered by it , I told him I am with a ¬Æeptilian woman and that even she kept cloaked - and he said ' dont you know ... ? we dont need to be cloaked anymore ... ' and he grinned - it was so freaky

so that was three spotted on one outing de cloaking

Anyone  else seeing a lot de-cloak ? 

Is it the weather , some kind of change in  the sunlight which is making them de cloak ? or that they are more confident that the mothership is landing soon ?

would like to hear from  anyone with info. thanks.

When a Girl shows you shes Reptilian ...
found out my gfriend is reptilian.

The other night when we were in bed  she said I‚Äôve got something to show you tonight.

she shifted ‚Ä¶

showed me her true reptoid self , to say I‚Äôm still shocked is an understatement

she was covered in scales , i was so freaked she shifted back and i was freaking out , like i was leaving there and then.

so  then she blocked my way and shifted again , into a poor mans Jenifer  aniston , i wasn‚Äôt impressed , rank !!! so she shifted again , and again  , until finally she was proper mint , she was in the form of a  supermodel.

Ah I was made up , proper made up, was proper mint.

That  evening we met up with my mates down the local , and there were all  like ‚Äòmate how did you pull that , thats my dream girl ‚Äò - and I have to  admit I was loving it , I was Mr popular , getting pints bought for me  and everything. Little did they know that it was my same dolly that I‚Äôve  been with all year.

But  as the week went on , I knew it wasn‚Äôt right , not right at all , I  knew she was reptoid , and when I was in bed with her I knew she had  scales skin , but she looked so great ‚Ä¶ could i just get over it ?

I  knew I couldn‚Äôt so I told her I was leaving. With that she shifted into  her true repulsive reptilian form and she told me a big story , she had  come to Earth from Alpha Draconia , a star system which had banished her  because she had done the worst things a reptilian could do - I did feel  sorry for her cause I had done some bird myself , but still it was  fakin reptoid , she told me she could only hold her human image via a  holographic symmetry which had been rigged into my nervous system and  she is feeding off me which gives the appearance of humanoid to the rest  of the population , without my feeding her the juice she will appear  reptoid to everyone and get taken into an underground base.

I was ready to leave and then gone and done it again didn‚Äôt she ‚Ä¶ she only went and shifted into a movie star ‚Ä¶ my fave one ‚Ä¶.

So  back down the pub I was , and everyones on it , man , they are all over  me ‚Äò billy boy how do you knock up this one , you star !‚Äô and again the  drinks are flowing , I‚Äôm getting into the clubs , the restaurants , and  things are just the way I‚Äôve always wanted‚Ä¶

thing is ‚Ä¶ I know she‚Äôs a reptoid ‚Ä¶.

Anyone  else experiencing the same thing ? What did you do ? what should i do ,  stick with it , knowing i can have her shift into the besties , or  should i acknowledge I just can‚Äôt go with a reptilian ?
The Reptilian Underworld
The ¬Æreptilians , ahhh the ¬Æreptilians ‚Ä¶

For so long we have wondered where they are , and came to the conclusion they must be in the Underworld

Our thinking was they were under the earth , in the tunnels , 

they had been spotted in the sewers by the junkies , the american indians had seen them in the caves , the divers had spotted them underwater and yet still people ask for confirmation

As our exploration goes ever more intense there are those who now can see them on the television sets 

those who see them among family members and even those who discover their spouse are ¬Æreptilian 

We live in the ¬Æreptilian age ‚Ä¶

Thoughts on pleiadians?
Has anyone here had any contact with pleiadians (tall whites/nordics/'space brothers'/etc) in anyway, good or bad?

They've always fascinated me, but I've read that their either just reptilians in another form or that they're working closely with the reptilians and like them, are NOT to be trusted. I hope this isn't true and if not, than what would you guys say their connection is the reptilians?
Reptilian Knowledge
Reptilians - and all that is coming ....

For some time now I have been the one to announce the final invasion of the Reptilians on Earth

For hundreds of thousands of years they have silently been beneath the Earth - unable to reproduce due to the little known fact a species can only sporn if the species is within its own solar system

The sun is the spark of life and a human sun cannot give the spark of life to a Reptilian - only Alpha Draconias sun rays can provide the jump start spark for Reptilian life - hence the hybrids they later embarked upon.

Long ago their craft crashed in the Himalayas - and overtime human warlords took a dislike to them and sent them packing ... packing below the earth 

Unable to reproduce they were never a match for humans - they put their hybrids aboveground but the numbers were of no significance ... until recently ...

They have been building their technological cities underground and they have built their beacon

A Beacon which has been able to signal their homeworld Alpha Draconia

Finally the  signal has reached their homeworld - the other Reptilians know where the lost ancient Reptilans have been all this time 

On the 24th dec , xmas eve , the Reptilian mothership will be over NYC and they will land

Fight Club - with underground Reptilians for cash in hand
I have spent 4 months recovering from one of the most abhorant fights I have ever had ... with a reptilian

I have a lot of fighting history , semi MMA middleweight

Then I had to face a Reptilian , it was one of the most raged fights I have ever had to compete in.

Of course it had a private audience. You wont see one of these televised , ever.

Any other fighters out there who went through this ordeal ? It was rough

&#x200B;

A shady guy from the fighting buisness approached me , guy was disgraced in the business a few years back

Then there he was , I was drinking in a bar , I was broke , not a penny.

We chatted and he said he would help get me back on my feet , earn money like the big stars he said.

One month later and I was back in shape. Fight night came , I was ready.

I was expecting the limo and the enterance to vegas / the girls the fame.

But what did I get ?

An old datsun van , a dark warehouse on the outskirts , no women , just bodyguards.

Yeah I took the upfront payment , it was a lot , a lot.

And I was shown the second case , if I won the fight it was mine.

Stepped in the ring , looked around and they was all in those masks , venitian ones. Suited types , I knew there was some money in the room.

Fight was brutal , as brutal as they come , and yeah ... seeing a reptilian decloak for the fight ? well ... you gotta keep yourself together.

Would I do it again ? no way , no way.

&#x200B;

Just wondering if theres any other ex MMA on here who have done the same.

Help finding story of encounter, some kind of cult worshipping a reptilian ‚Äúgod‚Äù
Hi! Im looking for a story of a reptilian encounter and I can‚Äôt find it in any of my paranormal subs. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here remembers reading a story about someone‚Äôs reptilian encounter in a desert area? From what I remember this person was on a camping/hiking trip in the western part of the US (Utah? Nevada?) with friends/family and while they were out hiking they came across a strange sight. Some distance away they saw a small group of humans doing what looked like some kind of ritual and then a huge reptilian/humanoid appears (implied that the humans worship this reptilian like a god). But the reptilian realizes they‚Äôre being watched and disappears. 
Hope someone remembers this and can help me find it.

Thanks

I just found out this had been uploaded online. Usually you would send him a 2TB hard drive and he'd put the ark drive on it free and send it back to you but someone has uploaded it to one drive.

I think it's an important resource for everyone in these times of abhorrent censorship.

From Mark's site: "I have been online since the days before the World Wide Web became popular. Since that time, I began collecting, studying and archiving information about our world and the events that have been occurring in it. I never left it to chance that information I came across during my search would always be available online. So, whenever I found something that I thought was worthwhile, I downloaded it and backed it up offline. As you can imagine, this much data archiving would result in an enormous amount of material. Quite frankly, it would be hard for me even to describe the amount of information I have pulled from this repository of knowledge and experience that we call the Internet.

Years ago, a friend asked me if I could place the best material that I had collected onto a hard drive for him, so that he could browse it and study it according to his interests, and at his pace and leisure. I said yes, and began the task of collecting the best data that I had gathered into a huge digital library, and copied it onto the hard drive that my friend provided. I then thought, why not share this information by making it available to anyone who wants it?

The A.R.K. drive consists of over 3,400 video files, 9,500 digital books, and 26,000 audio files. These files will always be available to you for offline browsing, playback and study, with no internet connection required to access any of the data on the drive. You may then "pass it along" by sharing any or all of this information with anyone you wish.

Breaking news - The Main Reptilian Mothership will be here by Xmas - 10 Billion reptilians on Earth
I have been channeling with those from Apha Draconia and they have shown me what christmas eve holds for the planet Earth

The full , main , control Mothership will arrive on Earth at 6pm

On board will be 10 billion Reptilians

Their planet is now unliveable and they will be here to takeover our home

The Reptilans will arrive in a cloaked ship and then de cloak over NYC at 6pm - the decloaking will block the sun

They will then be sent down a chute and will then enter whichever buildings they want

They are the Reptilians and they cannot be stopped 

Should we resist or should we just agree to move to their homeworld in exchange for ours ?
How many Reptilians are with us ? new data says 60% of the world are Reptilians
New data shows that 60% of the world are now Reptilians.

Mankind has been visited by crafts , discs / triangles / cigars for decades now

They have been putting the Reptilians on the planet when they land

Most shops have Reptilian staff , most banks , most restaurants ...

Now it has been confirmed at 60% does this mean that they will colonise the planet - heating it up - making it more like their prefered Reptilian temperature.

Some of us have captured Reptilians but when we call 911 a Reptilian cop gets sent out !

What should we do ?
Just wondering about ancient civilizations and language, i want to hear your thoughts about it?
 hey guys Id like to hear your opinion, I really like the idea that GH sets, that pretty much a catastrophe reset civilization and it tried to restart itself. My question is, did they not have some sort of written language? When you hear stories of Aztecs Mayas Incas they speak about these visitors but I wonder why did they not teach them to write, assuming they did. Im wondering what you think of this?

This also gives in to my second question do you guys think our way of language and writing is the only way of communicating? I mean as in symbols to express ideas..are there other ways you think?

One way i could think is that it was more of a telepathic communication going on so in that sense maybe writing was not as necessary, but then i think how could you store such vast amount of information.

Another was maybe their communication was so advanced that it got shorter kind of the way more emojis are beign used or the way we shorten letters to mean words like LOL and so on.

Anywho drop your thoughts!

factthey have never been found is evidence they don't exist, and the reason they don't exist is because the world isn't flat.

Plate Tectonics
Does anyone know if there are any specific globe-skeptical theories regarding why continental drift occurs? It's a phenomenon that has been directly observed, and in my field of evolutionary biology, it is actually a really important factor in species distribution and paleobiology. 

I know most globe-skeptics are also young earth creationists, but there are many instances of what species/fossils are being found where which are well explained by plate tectonics, I've never heard any flat earth curiosity about such facts.

I'm obsessed with the flat earth subculture mostly because it's entertaining to me, but I've never heard this topic brought up. The explanation only works with a "globe earth" in my mind, but I'm always curious to hear the other side's explanations.

You can clearly see the curvature of the earth at around 3:00. There is no cut from liftoff to then. Checkmate.

‚ÄúHere is your exposure,‚Äù says man who doesn‚Äôt know what exposure is
Flat earthers who believe the sun is just a few miles away were very excited to see this video clip, which appears to show clouds in front of and behind it. Someone pointed out that this is probably an artifact of the sun‚Äôs bloom overpowering the less dense clouds (making them seem ‚Äúbehind‚Äù the sun) but not the more dense clouds, and that correcting the exposure would show them all to be in front of (ie, below) the sun. 

You might think flat earthers would be hip to exposure by now, since they‚Äôre reminded of it every time they ask why there are no stars in photos of the earth from space, but you would be underestimating their capacity for failure. This particular goof ‚Äúcorrected the exposure‚Äù by turning it into a negative.

wasted 2:20 minutes of my life watching this video, I am gonna explain in comments

Mt. Rainier‚Äôs (shadow) from Liberty Lake. The mountain is behind the curve, but we can see it's shadow.

Has Flatwit ever queried why Earthly mountains're are so puny of height relative to the lateral extent of the Earth: like it's about 24,000 mile around a great circle (or across a diameteter - we get the same distance) and yet the very highest mountain @all isn't even a half-dozen mile-high !?
Under Flatwit's scenario there's _no reason whatsoever_  why the land should not rise inlandwards _as steeply_ as is does up a fairly steep mountainside: say __1:8__ on-average would not be an outrageous stepth to posit ... which would result in elevation in the most distant-from-the-coast places of _hundreds of miles_  ... but _we just do not get anything even remotely approaching_  that!

... which query could reasonably be 'captured' as

#####‚ùù ¬ø¬° why is Flatwit Earth
###so very level !? ‚ùû
###
or even

###‚ùù... indeed so very flat !? ‚ùû
###
... fussing over the distinction between "level" & "flat".

It could be argued that mountains would be subject to the same height limitations  ... but Flatwit _utterly denies gravity ;  and anyway_  there could be _really strong band in-tension_ comprising the whole disc, & set at about the place where _the Dome meets_  the disc, holding it all in ... like _a corset_ , sorto-thing.

Elevation Explain This.....
 The heliocentric model claims the Earth is 25,000 miles in circumference covering at 8 inches per mile squared. A plane going 500 miles per hour would have to constantly descend at 2777 every half mile every minute it's in the air. If it didn't do so the plane would end up at 166,666 feet over and would be traveling into "outer space". Speaking of planes, if the Earth is rotating at 1,000 miles an hour... how does one travel in the direction against the spin or vice versa? Wouldn't one trip be significantly faster than the other? Or what about a hovering helicopter? Why does it stay in it's starting location without movement?

That mischievous South Star Sigma Octantis
I've seen people try to explain the North star and why it can't be seen from the southern hemisphere.  These are generally really poor and don't stand up to scrutiny but it opens up a whole new problem for flat earthers - If I look directly north on a clear sky I will see the North star and hypothetically, if I turn 180 degrees and look directly south,  I could see the south star when within range and the magical ether had cleared.  However  if I travel 1000 miles either Turnwise or Widdershins, looking south still brings me to bear on the South Star.  Even if I travel to the other side of the disk,  the south star is to my south.  And to make matters worse,  a person on the opposite side of the disk to me,  with the magic magnetic mountain between us, also looking South, away from the mountain would see the same star that I'm looking at at the exact same time.

Of course, this is perfectly explained with the globe model but we need even more powerful magic from the flat earthers.

The origin of the flat earth theory (according to Wikipedia)
The myth of the flat Earth, or the flat earth error, is a modern historical misconception that European scholars and educated people during the Middle Ages believed the Earth to be flat.

The famous "Flat Earth" Flammarion engraving originates with Flammarion's 1888 L'atmosph√®re: m√©t√©orologie populaire (p. 163).

The earliest clear documentation of the idea of a spherical Earth comes from the ancient Greeks (5th century BC). The belief was widespread in the Greek world when Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of Earth around 240 BC. This knowledge spread with Greek influence such that during the Early Middle Ages (~600‚Äì1000 AD), most European and Middle Eastern scholars espoused Earth's sphericity.[3] Belief in a flat Earth among educated Europeans was almost nonexistent from the Late Middle Ages onward, though fanciful depictions appear in art, such as the exterior panels of Hieronymus Bosch's famous triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights, in which a disc-shaped Earth is shown floating inside a transparent sphere.

According to Stephen Jay Gould, "there never was a period of 'flat Earth darkness' among scholars, regardless of how the public at large may have conceptualized our planet both then and now. Greek knowledge of sphericity never faded, and all major medieval scholars accepted the Earth's roundness as an established fact of cosmology." Historians of science David Lindberg and Ronald Numbers point out that "there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference".

Historian Jeffrey Burton Russell says the flat-Earth error flourished most between 1870 and 1920, and had to do with the ideological setting created by struggles over biological evolution. Russell claims "with extraordinary few exceptions no educated person in the history of Western Civilization from the third century B.C. onward believed that the Earth was flat", and ascribes popularization of the flat-Earth myth to histories by John William Draper, Andrew Dickson White, and Washington Irving.

Early modern period

French dramatist Cyrano de Bergerac in chapter 5 of his Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon (published two years posthumously in 1657) quotes St. Augustine as saying "that in his day and age the Earth was as flat as a stove lid and that it floated on water like half of a sliced orange." Robert Burton, in his The Anatomy of Melancholy wrote:

    Virgil, sometime bishop of Salzburg (as Aventinus anno 745 relates), by Bonifacius, bishop of Mentz, was therefore called in question, because he held antipodes (which they made a doubt whether Christ died for) and so by that means took away the seat of hell, or so contracted it, that it could bear no proportion to heaven, and contradicted that opinion of Austin [St. Augustine], Basil, Lactantius, that held the Earth round as a trencher (whom Acosta and common experience more largely confute) but not as a ball.

Thus, there is evidence that accusations of Flat Earthism, though somewhat whimsical (Burton ends his digression with a legitimate quotation of St. Augustine: "Better doubt of things concealed, than to contend about uncertainties, where Abraham's bosom is, and hell fire"[11]), were used to discredit opposing authorities several centuries before the 19th. Another early mention in literature is Ludvig Holberg's comedy Erasmus Montanus (1723). Erasmus Montanus meets considerable opposition when he claims the Earth is round, since all the peasants hold it to be flat. He is not allowed to marry his fianc√©e until he cries "The Earth is flat as a pancake". In Thomas Jefferson's book Notes on the State of Virginia (1784), framed as answers to a series of questions (queries), Jefferson uses the "Query" regarding religion to attack the idea of state-sponsored official religions. In the chapter, Jefferson relates a series of official erroneous beliefs about nature forced upon people by authority. One of these is the episode of Galileo's struggles with authority, which Jefferson erroneously frames in terms of the shape of the globe:

    Government is just as infallible too when it fixes systems in physics. Galileo was sent to the inquisition for affirming that the Earth was a sphere: the government had declared it to be as flat as a trencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This error however at length prevailed, the Earth became a globe, and Descartes declared it was whirled round its axis by a vortex.

19th century

The 19th century was a period in which the perception of an antagonism between religion and science was especially strong. The disputes surrounding the Darwinian revolution contributed to the birth of the conflict thesis,[5] a view of history according to which any interaction between religion and science would almost inevitably lead to open hostility.

What holds the Sun and Moon up over the flat Earth?
In the flat Earth model the Sun and Moon ae shown as tiny and following a circular pattern always above the Earth in an attempt to explain the day and night cycle in a way that wouldn't be disproven by the existence of time zones. Another flat Earth argument I have seen involves pouring water on a ball and saying that water can't cling to a sphere. Well I have never seen a basketball that would stay up in the air when not supported by anything and continue to fly in a circular pattern forever.

Genuine Questions
With this questions, my intention is **not to make fun of anyone's theories, beliefs and opinions**. I'm just **curious** about flat earth answers on these questions.

The force that we‚Äôre considering is called centrifugal force, which is the force that acts on objects and tends to push them away from the center of rotation. We can use a formula to calculate this force, which is:

F = m * v^2 / r

* F is what we‚Äôre solving for. It‚Äôs the centrifugal force, in Newtons.
* M is mass in kilograms. For this example it‚Äôs a person weighing 81.65kg (180lbs)
* V is the angular velocity of the object‚Äôs rotation, in radians per second. A radian sounds complex but it‚Äôs really just the radius of a circle wrapped around the outside of the circle. This equates to 57.3 degrees. Someone standing at the equator would have an angular velocity of about .0000701 radians per second due to the earth‚Äôs rotation. 
* r is the radius of the circle made by the rotation around a central point. The radius of the earth at the equator is said to be 6377km. 

Let‚Äôs plug in our numbers and see what the equation looks like: 

F = 81.65kg * (0.0000701 rad /s)^2 * 6377km

We can continue to solve and simplify according to orders of operation. 

F = 81.65kg * 4.95e-12 rad^2/s^2 * 6377km

F = 2.74 N

1 Newton is equivalent to about 0.2248 pounds, so the centrifugal force is equivalent to about 0.62 pounds. This means a 180lb person would be .62lbs lighter standing on the equator due to the rotation of the earth than if they were at one of the poles. 

Keep in mind that this equation is used to calculate the force exerted by a wide variety of things in industry such as centrifuges, pumps, governors, clutches, even merry-go-rounds. You can use it to calculate the centrifugal force on any object that spins around a central point.

Amateur radio shows the earth is round

I am an amateur radio operator (aka radio ham) and my everyday observations are consistent with the round earth model.

I take part in SOTA (Summits on the Air). I climb to the tops of hills and mountains and set up a radio station. I make contacts using various different radio bands and communicate with people both locally and over long distances.

If I use the 2m band (145MHz) I make mostly local contacts but I also manage to talk to others also on summits up to about 150km. If I switch to HF (also known as short wave) then I can communicate much further. On 40m (7MHz) contacts are usually between 500 and 1000km and on 20m (14MHz) they are 1000km to 2000km, sometimes getting as far as the US (5000km from the UK).

The round earth model can explain these observations:

VHF communication is mostly line of sight although signals can travel a little further as they are refracted by the atmosphere. For the summit to summit contacts, if I enter the altitudes of the two stations into an online calculator it will tell me the maximum line of sight range. These figures are always entirely consistent with my observations.

HF radio signals bounce off the ionosphere which is the upper atmosphere. Radiation from the sun strips electrons from the air molecules to form ions which can refract radio signals back down to earth. The degree to which this refraction happens depends on the amount of radiation from the sun, the frequency used and the angle at which the signal hits the ionosphere. If you send a radio signal straight up you can find the critical frequency. This is the highest frequency where the signal is bounced straight back down again. At the moment this is about 4MHz during the day so signals higher in frequency go straight out into space. But if the signal hits the ionosphere at a lower angle then it will be refracted, effectively reflecting it back to earth. As the frequency increases, the angle has to be lower and lower for the signal to return to earth. So this explains why my 7MHz signals can reach nearer stations than the 14MHz signals.

The time of day and year has a big impact on how far signals will go on any particular frequency. For example, during the afternoon I might be working stations around Europe. As the earth rotates and the sun's strength moves west I can no longer work Europeans but there are now Americans audible. And then at about 11 or 12 o'clock it all goes quiet and there are no more signals.

From my home location, in a valley, I can not hear many stations on VHF unless they are on a hill top. But I can still work stations far away on HF even though they are blocked by the hills around me, because they are bouncing off the ionosphere.

In the flat earth model, why would the frequency affect how far the signals travel? Why would the time of day matter? How can I still make contacts over long distances even though I live in a valley?

There is, however, something rather unsettling about this demonstration for those that are paying attention. The limit of the observable universe is approximately 10^(27) metres. Going the other way, Planck Length is about 10^(-35) metres. In other words, from the reference point of a human-sized object, the world of the very tiny extends around *eight orders of magnitude* (100 million times) beyond that of the size of the universe.

Travelers noticed changes in the sun's position in different locations.  The bottom, but not the tops of ships and caravans would vanish as they went beyond the horizon.

The problem with very ancient evidence is we don't know if it's metaphorical or literal, because a lot of records have been lost.  Flatness was used poetically in certain cases.

‚ÄúPropagation of Electromagnetic Fields Over Flat Earth‚Äù

This paper is a mathematical exercise, and involves short-range microwave propagation. The ground is modelled as flat to simplify the math. The *model* is flat, not the earth. In electronics, ‚Äúearth‚Äù is a term for electrical ground.

The troll discusses other sources, but I have not investigated others. Lies at the beginning, I don‚Äôt need more.

Flerf inconsistencies and facts that prove the Earth is Round that cant be disproven
Flerfs are inconsistent af, some say Earth is stationary, some say it is accelerating upwards at 9'8 m/s¬≤, neither make sense, Earth has been proven to move and the second doesnt make sense because they cant understand what an acceleration means

"If the Earth is round why dont planes tilt down?" Thtas what planes do, and if the Earth was flat planes would need to tilt left or right

"Clouds pass behind the Moon" that proves that ni flat earther has ever touched a telescope

Has any flat earther explained how the "atmoshperic refraction" works? They always say refraction whenever something is in the horizon

Eclipses, Northen lights, Midnight Sun, non of those work in a flat earth, they will always say it works but it doesnt, if someone is from Norway, Iceland or Greenland they now how the Sun moves, it moves from left to right, for it to work on a flat earth it should do a full circle

There, WAY MORE, astronomical phenomena that cant be disproven and they will completely ignore

Conclusion, ignore flat earthers, one day their ignorance will fire back

 Prompt: prove the earth is flat

The idea that the Earth is flat is a conspiracy theory and has been debunked by a significant amount of scientific evidence. The scientific consensus is that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is roughly spherical in shape but slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator due to its rotation. This shape has been confirmed through various forms of evidence, including:

ships disappear over the horizon in a way that is consistent with a curved Earth.
that images from space show a curved Earth.
that the Earth's shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse is curved, which can only happen if the Earth is a sphere.
 that the Earth's gravity is consistent with a spherical shape.
that Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which relies on factthat the Earth is a sphere, works accurately.

It's important to note that the evidence of a round earth is not limited to these examples and the scientific community have a wide range of evidence that confirms the earth is round.

It's worth mentioning that the flat earth theory is not supported by any scientific evidence, and the claims made by flat-Earth believers are not supported by scientific evidence or research. It's important to be critical of information and to seek out credible sources when evaluating any claim.

As an avid gamer, I think a fantasy game with a Flat Earth being part of the lore and world building would be really interesting.
I don't at all believe Flat Earth, so I hope this sub isn't just for believers. And honestly, some of the ideas flat earthers come up with are just insane... But so fascinating. Self lighting moons, a sun that's actually really close, a world with an actual edge, all kinds of insane ideas that would be extremely cool to actually see made real (well, fictional 'real') in a game. I'm thinking probably some form of an rpg would do it best, eastern or western. Make the world being flat part of the story, build the entire setting around it. Have it for into detail about how everything works, it would be a truly alien feeling world. I might not at all believe in flat earth, but some of the ideas around it are cool enough that I'd like to see it explored in an immersive game. Hell, just thought of something funny. In most games, the sky box isn't real, it's just a game design thing that is used to just look like a sky. In this kind of game, they could make the sky box ACTUALLY CANON and even build lore around it. Even make it a part of the story where you somehow escape through the sky box for some narrative reason. 

Anyway, yeah. Was reading some flat earth ideas, and just thought, yeah, this would make an awesome video game.

To all the flat earthers
The only reason the flat earth theory exists is because of its echo chamber. What is an echo chamber?  It's an insular communication space where everyone agrees with the information and no outside input is allowed. It's when you hear the same rhetoric from every scientist, teacher, institution, politician, news station, and everyone around you. It would be hard to see another perspective after being so saturated as you are. So, if globe earth could have more of a voice, maybe there would be less misunderstanding, because obviously this community has the wrong image of the globe earth theory.

some avail in it _anyway_ : but the folk who are implementing  stuff like __this__ from their h√¶riplanes, because they use frequencies @ which there must be __line-of-sight__, _and_  because the h√¶riplanes are constantly moving-about, and @ different altitudes, are _totally working with_ the curvature of the Earth as prettymuch _a directly-experienced matter_, totally routinely.

... and they're far from be√Øng the only ones who are, aswell! ... but this might be a particularly striking example ... certainly _I figure_  it is: 't'swhy I chose it.

Ironically, though, Goddard himself is notorious for perpetuating *a different* fallacy: he _absolutely would not be apprised of_  the unnecessarity of that (what we now quite rightly find to be) thoroughly bizarre way - _and_  rather messy way, plumbing-wise - of constructing the first ever liquid-fuel-befuelt rocket: ie with the exhaust nozzle _fore_  of the fuel-tanks!

A couple physics challenges for any flerf
1. Calculate the centrifugal force due to the Earth's "presupposed" spin acting on a 100 lb weight (calibrated at the north pole) at the equator. Assume all globe values. What would a bathroom scale say that weight now weighs? 

2. Construct a free-body diagram that would be used to calculate terminal velocity of a perfectly smooth sphere. Even better if you can give me the actual speed of a 5kg, 10 cm diameter sphere. 

3. How many pounds of force would a 1ft diameter beach ball filled with air produce if fully submerged in water? What formula did you use?

While I am asking, I also don't get how there can be sun in europe and south Africa at the same time if the sun is small and projects light in a circle...this would entail that the diameter of the circle of light is enormous, so it should also be light in asia at the same time no?

Petition to rename this subreddit r/foodfortrolls
Every "flerf" is just a troll and/or con artist. They need attention to thrive. Quit giving it to them.

I came here for the posts that show demonstrations of Earth's roundness, because I realized did passively accept that as fact. Thanks to the flat Earth movement I was able to engage critically with the observations and data that back up factthat Earth is a globe. I learned how our understanding of the universe has evolved, and continues to evolve.

All flerfs have are trolling and bad faith arguments. No data. No numbers backed up by measurements. No cohesive model with any predictive or useful properties. They have settled into a steady state, and nothing will change that. It's kinda pathetic, I'm sure you could psychoanalyze their behavior and explain it as a sort of sunk cost fallacy, but I have stopped caring.

Remember this the next time one of these clowns engages with you, writhing around saying batshit nonsense in order to keep your attention; that's the best thing they have to do with their time. And apparently, being trolled is the best thing that *you* have to do with *yours*. When you find yourself in such situations, I implore you do what I'm doing right now;

They say no, Earths surface isn‚Äôt pulling things down with its charge, rather it is the air around us that is positively charged or something. Idk. If any of you guys know wtf they are talking about, I‚Äôd love to understand it better (and why it is likely dumb).

I'd like to see flerfs explain this

Ship vanishing over a horizon? Don't use a P900‚Äîuse some proper kit!
If you want to film a ship going over the horizon and do it properly, a piddling little P900/1000 ain't going to cut it. You're going to need some seriously badass pro kit to do the job properly.

So we start with two of these:

[URSA Mini Pro 12K](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicursaminipro)

Then you slap this very bad boy on the front of each camera:

[Fujinon UA107](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1309393-REG/fujinon_ua107x8_4besm_4k_premier_8_4_900mm_16_8_1800mm.html)

Hire in a big industrial scissor lift with an 80' reach. Place one rig on the ground, the other on the lift. Lock both cameras to the same timecode reference, film away and then present both videos side-by-side with in-vision timecode. Compare the time differential when the ship disappears with respect to both cameras.

You could also record the AIS nav data from the ship, giving position, course and speed and do some whizzo math to calculate curvature: don't forget to record environmental conditions to account for refraction. Also don't forget to record the GPS position and height of the cameras above sea level.

Special bonus: kick in the X2 range extender on the lens which gets you to 1800mm focal length. Then take the raw 12K footage and do a 6.4:1 crop-down to 1080p in post to get you the equivalent of a 11,520mm focal length. This should allow you to see what the captain had for breakfast.

Sit back and watch flerfers desperately try to debunk the result.

A very realistic weird dream about a flat earth and Elon musk.
Last week, I had a dream that has been haunting me ever since. I saw a massive planet, frozen solid like a cheese ball, with our earth just a tiny piece of it. Each part of this planet was separated by ice, and the only way to travel between these different earths was by using Elon Musk's Falcon 9 rocket.

This dream has left me with so many questions, and I can't shake the feeling that there is more to it than just a simple dream. I can't help but wonder if this dream is actually a coded message, revealing some kind of secret conspiracy. Could it be that there are multiple earths out there, and Elon Musk is the only one who knows how to reach them?

I'm not sure what to make of all this, but one thing is for certain: this dream has left me with a deep sense of unease. I can't shake the feeling that there is something bigger at play here, and that there is more to this dream than meets the eye.

Going through the most recent posts, there's not much "illuminating" going on here.

website
there used to be a website a few years ago. it had multiple articles, it‚Äôd been around for many years, and it was all about illuminati information. different articles/threads on celebrities, signs, et cetera. it was a gold mine. i can‚Äôt find it now!! does anyone know the website i‚Äôm talking about?
Old video
I saw a video on YouTube back in 2020. It was just an audio recording, no actual video footage. It was a man who was speaking and it was recorded ( I believe ) in the mid to late 1900‚Äôs. He was describing the origins of the Illuminati and the formation of the UN. I have looked all over trying to find it again and cannot Turn it up. If anyone knows what im talking about and can provide a link I would appreciate it

Mediocre celebrities of the Illuminati
Does anyone ever notice how most (not all) of the so-called famous members of the Illuminati are "contrived", mediocre talents at best? (for the most part).."manufactured" pop-stars.

Beyonce, Jay-Z, Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Kanye West,  Justin Bieber, Alicia Keys, Lil' Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Bono, Sean "P-Diddy" Combs, Chris Brown, Celine Dion, Lionel Richie..

I get that some of them have had hit songs (that you can count on one hand, & weren't all written by them individually but by "hit-making" producers) but ultimately their careers seem contrived & fabricated by major record labels.

Meanwhile, NOT members of the Illuminati (also on major record labels):

Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Who, Queen, Pink Floyd, RUSH, Tool, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Black Sabbath, David Bowie..

You can list literally HUNDREDS of other bands, pop stars & solo artists (from the 1950s to the 2000s) who aren't members (& are WAY more talented).

Coincidence.. thoughts..?

Is Dave Grohl Illuminati..? ;-)

Astral plane
I‚Äôm told to join the Illuminati you must meet them on the astral plane to initiate. I finally astral projected but was unable to locate them. Anyone have any info on this. Specifically the pythagorean Illuminati, the only ones I recognize as legit

Cicada 3301 and the Illuminati
The cicadas are a creation of the Nist. They used a coded novel to reveal the Russians created covid-19. They used the puzzle to leak the info to the public without having to reveal to the Russians how much access they have to their info. The pythagorean Illuminati employs the use of coded novels a lot to put its messages out. It‚Äôs not a coincidence. And why does their name spelled backwards lead to the nsa‚Äôs website? Because they‚Äôre still working with the cia, the nsa, and the nist to control the worlds data. A possibly far fetched speculation I have is that they have created an egregore that navigated the Russian info and stole the info for them

I would like to join the Illuminati. I have connections that are high up in the Free Masons. I‚Äôm not sure what is the ideal route to take. I seek wisdom and provide devotion. Times are unpredictable and I want to devote myself to an alliance that is pure and can provide me more growth. Please advise

The Plan [to get myself killed AGAIN]

Maybe this book about blue blood and world rulers interest some of you guys!
The Book is about this whole "Matrix" we are in and about the people that rule this world. (I would highly recommend reading it!)

&#x200B;

The secret of blue blood explains from a scientific point of view what blue blood is. The book also reveals the background of the cabal called blue blood, as well as the origin of the bearers of that blood.

&#x200B;

The book follows the secret rulers of the world from their beginning to the present day.

&#x200B;

Moving chronologically through history, it explains who is responsible for all significant historical events, from the time of Babylon until today, exclusively from a true point of view.

&#x200B;

This book reveals who the world's rulers are, but it also reveals what means and manipulations they used to come and stay in power in various countries in the world throughout history. At the same time, it will be revealed who the actual creators of all worldwide-famous religions are, as well as who their prophets actually are.

[in depth] what exactly is ‚Äúselling your soul‚Äù / how does one do it / what does it entail? (music/fame)
So I know a lot of people are talking about this subject right now, please don‚Äôt get annoyed or mad with me. I like to think I have a clearer vision on this subject.

I believe that ‚Äúselling your soul‚Äù is not real. You can sell your soul to the industry(physically) and to negativity, but your soul truly cannot be sold. 

So I‚Äôm wondering what are all these artists talking about? Is selling your soul for musical success and fame purely to sell yourself to the agendas of higher-ups? With fame and a platform, you must push the idea of darker lower vibrational entities (ie. satanism/illuminati symbolism in art and lyrics, drugs, oversexualization, violence and killing, etc).

As someone who knows that a soul cannot be transferred, what exactly is it?

As someone (a musical artist) whose reached the brink of sanity, how can one do it? Is it really just a summoning per se? And also,

for famous people, what/who decides who lives and dies?

I know that certain celebrities (jayz/rihanna/taylor swift/kanye/lana del rey/beyonce) have ‚Äúsold their soul‚Äù but they talk of selling their soul and then gaining reparations.

So you‚Äôd think, why not? 

If you can ‚Äúsell it‚Äù while here on the physical/material plane, and then plead to ‚ÄúGod‚Äù for forgiveness, and ‚Äúgod‚Äù will always accept it,

Why not?

But at the same time, lower level rappers/pop artists lose their lives for it.

So is it actually certain rituals that famous people have to partake in? And that‚Äôs why some semi-famous people don‚Äôt want to partake in them, so then that‚Äôs when they get killed? (ie. blood rituals, devil worship, pushing negative social agenda, child trafficking to the higher ups, etc)?

Is the music industry really this awful? What‚Äôs the purpose of this agenda?

And why don‚Äôt people ever turn to angels for the same results? As above so below.

I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúthe devil‚Äù gets it done faster. Is that why?

You know nothing about the Illuminati
The original Illuminati were radical republicans, humanists and social reformists.

They were not the elite - on the contrary, they fought against the tyrants.

They defended human rights, freethought, deism and gnosis.

They were teachers, scientists, lawyers and civil servants.

Goethe, Herder, Pestalozzi, Karl Von Eckartshausen...

What is enlightenment?
Is the path of enlightenment clearly defined? If so where? If not, is it up to the interpretation of those on the path? 

How do we know if we are on the path or not? I find myself indifferent to everyone else‚Äôs problems lately, feels like they‚Äôre all distracted with things that don‚Äôt matter. 
I feel like the path of enlightenment leads me out of this echo chamber of media regurgitation we call society. I want out.
Is public debt a conspiracy by the elite?
The country increases the amount of its money with reason and fairness in mind by taking on debt when the tax revenue isn‚Äôt enough? National debt works, which proves that it was possible to increase the amount of money beneficially?

Without taking on debt important work might have gone undone? And the currency hasn‚Äôt lost all of its value?

When the amount of money is increased this way, some amount of rewards for work need to be given up in the future to pay the debt?

Increasing the quantity of money by creating it without it being debt would require central planning, which can‚Äôt be done because we don‚Äôt live in a state of complete mutual agreement?

How many of you practice the Lotus Sutra
I only ask because the significance of the Lotus goes back to the beginning of time, from Egypt to Europe to Asia, and I consider the Lotus Sutra to be the highest teaching. 

Anyone practice the essential teaching of the Lotus Sutra as a path to enlightenment?

Also, what do you know about the Lotus Cults that have popped up throughout history? The White Lotus Society specifically and different Lotus cults in ancient Egypt?

For me, when you read the teachings of Nichiren you come to realize that you are in possession of the true and correct teaching for the age.

Surely this is worth getting into, I'd love to hear people's perspective on the Lotus Sutra and just the Lotus in general.

A 2021 short film titled "Twenty Something" streaming on Disney+ follows a 21 year-old woman attempting to celebrate her birthday at a bar with her friend; the 21 year-old is portrayed as three children disguised in a trench coat attempting to fit into the crowd, order drinks, and dance with others. After being overwhelmed and retreating to the bathroom a few times, she finds her confidence; it is at this point that she becomes visually represented as a fully grown woman, while everyone else around her turns to children. The film is supposed to be a metaphor for maturation and confidence, yet it goes out of its way to show kids in highly inappropriate scenarios.

The film itself is laced with suspect imagery, in addition to featuring frequently inappropriate interactions between adults and portrayals of children. Initially, the children order drinks at the bar, but flee to the restroom once they become overwhelmed. The middle aged child then provides a motivational speech to the other two kids, saying, "We are going to go back out on that dancefloor, shake our bottoms, stay up past our bedtime, and kiss our youth goodbye cause this is Gia's night!" 

After walking out back onto the dancefloor, a man sees the three kids in the trench-coat and mistakes a hump in the disguise for the girl's butt and proceeds to cat call her in a sensual manner. She then bumps into a man on the dancefloor who finds the girl attractive; the 16 year old in the middle of the disguise rubs against the man's lower half and proclaims her wish to marry him. The 10 year old is a bit uncomfortable while the 16 year old attempts to flirt. Later, the baby of the group climbs onto the shoulders of the other two and vomits onto the face of another man. Once their disguise is uncovered,  they once again retreat to the bathroom, this time being given a pep talk by their older friend. She cites a time that she pissed herself at a concert (presumably from being drunk) and gains enough motivation to leave the bathroom, now fully appearing as an adult. As she walks through the club, other club-goers observe her confidence, and are reduced to being children. One guy making out with a girl sees an attractive, large-breasted woman pass by and attempts to flirt with her after being visually reduced to a child.

While some may think this is simply a motivational story of a woman maturing and gaining confidence in herself, it clearly passes the threshold of appropriate depictions of children. I post this to make you more aware of this type of programming, so that you may be on guard and be better prepared to filter content for your children and families.

My grandma wrote some weird things down, can anyone elaborate?

When I was around 11, I used to draw in this notepad at my grandmas house, she didn‚Äôt really use it just a random empty notepad she left laying around.

Anyway one day I was flicking through it and I see (in a pen that means it was obviously written by my grandma) a drawing of a star. 
On the top of the page was the word ‚ÄúILLUMINATI‚Äù and then ‚ÄúTHE SHINING STAR, THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT.‚Äù

I felt like I shouldn‚Äôt have seen it. I was perturbed so I destroyed it (ran it under the tap, scrunched it up, chucked it away)

She had never mentioned anything like this before or done anything similar (in front of us anyway) and I found it weird she would write that in a notepad she knew I drew horses and flowers in. Haven‚Äôt spoken to her in years as she‚Äôs a problematic narcissist.

I know it can just be that she didn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúilluminati‚Äù insinuated, and just used it as some descriptor of a bright star. But if anyone thinks there‚Äôs some other meaning to it I would love to know.

Hahahaha smart one guys

Who are the Illuminati and how/why did they become associated with grand conspiracy theory?
This is an edit/update/expansion of [a post I made in this sub](https://np.reddit.com/r/illuminati/comments/gh40cl/how_the_illuminati_came_to_be_the_catchall_term/) about a year ago.

The goal, here, is *not to fully explore the history of the Illuminati conspiracy theory development*, but rather to focus on the transition from actual historical organization to the uber-conspiracy most know it as today.

----

TL;DR for those who don't want to go through all of this: 18th century Bavarian political and philosophical society -> philosophical trends of the early 19th century -> mid-19th century academic conspiracy theories about the French Revolution -> Late 20th century pop conspiracy fiction -> fringe conspiracy terminology -> hip hop cultural adaptation -> modern social media conspiracy theory. Details follow; references at the end.

----

It's important to know, just to start that [Adam Weishaupt's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt) [Bavarian Illuminati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati) were one of many branches in the underground current of continental Europe's intellectual push against monarchy and the church in the late 18th century (around the time of the US Revolutionary War). Weishaupt was a professor of law who decided to form his own fraternity based on the many that were popular in central Europe at the time, including Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, various vestiges of chivalric (knights) orders, monastic orders and their less isolated spin-offs, etc. From these templates he built his fraternity around prevalent academic theories regarding the nature of the Greek mystery schools, especially that of Minerva (AKA Athena) from whom most of the symbolism of the Illuminati was developed.

It's often said in conspiracy circles that the Illuminati continued on after their dissolution approx. 20 years after their founding, as an intellectual tradition that informed the [Jacobites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobitism) and other similar groups in the early 19th century. This is... highly debatable, but what isn't debatable is that that intellectual movement that the Illuminati were born from (and involved several people in its founding and formation, not just Adam Weishaupt) was also formative for many other similar traditions. [*If you wish to follow the history of early Illuminati conspiracy theory regarding the Jacobites, I recommend [this article](https://theconversation.com/simoninis-letter-the-19th-century-text-that-influenced-antisemitic-conspiracy-theories-about-the-illuminati-134635)*]

But, at the time, many people didn't make that nuanced distinction, and there are letters from the time (George Washington's letter to American Freemasons being one of the most well known) where it's clear that this intellectual movement was just being called the Illuminati without explicitly referring to Weishaupt's order. Whether this was widespread is less clear, but it was very much a documented occurrence.

Because of the tumult in France during their revolution, there was significant fear among other monarchies of a similar event elsewhere and so it is likely that this was the cause of some continued popularity of the use of the name. Over time that name became a placeholder, especially in academic circles, for this larger fear of anti-monarchy and anti-clerical political and philosophical currents which could give rise to future revolution.

But it was rarely used in the mainstream until the 1970s saw the creation of Robert Anton Wilson's Illuminatus! Trilogy. This book's influence, if looked at objectively and post-facto, is absurdly large. Wilson took elements of dozens of historical organizations, conspiracy theories and intellectual traditions and blended them into a comedy/sci-fi story that became a staple of 1970s and 80s university counter-culture along with less long-term recognizable names such as the Anarchist's Cookbook, Principia Discordia and the various Bob Dobs/Church of the Subgenius materials. It was where the term Illuminati transformed from a vague notion of a political/philosophical current in 19th century Europe to the unified conspiracy theory that is widely touted today.

It had commercial help in this. Steve Jackson Games published a board/card game in the 1980s based on the book and later, during the Magic: The Gathering craze, revised the game as a collectable trading card game with updated political satire for the 1990s. Both products saw reasonable success, appearing in most hobby shops in the US during their peaks.

But it was the adoption of this mostly fringe fascination with the now completely transformed cultural meme named the Illuminati by 2000s hip hop culture that brought it out of the college dorm room and into the general public consciousness.

And that brings us to the online conspiracy culture of the 2010s where "Illuminati" was already a well-entrenched cultural meme, available to such a wide segment of society that it's probably better known at this point than any other piece of conspiracy terminology.

## The Darker Side

The preceding is a very broad-brush overview of the evolution of the references to the the "Illuminati" by name, but the development of modern, grand conspiracy theory was not merely a matter of naming. The undercurrents of these conspiracies developed from several sources ranging from the existential terror of the cold war to the counter-culture movement of the 1960s and 1970s. But one thread in modern Illuminati conspiracy theory that continues to rear its head is far darker: the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories of the early 20th century that were expanded, utilized and amplified by the Nazi regime during World War II.

These conspiracies were nothing new. Europeans had been demonizing Jews for centuries. But the vector of secret societies as a way for such anti-Semitism to divorce itself from the need for tangible evidence. After all, factthat you don't see these Jewish-influenced secret societies at work is exactly what you expect from a ***secret*** society! This enabled a post-war wave of anti-Semetic conspiracy theory which, in the face of the horrors of the Holocaust, was eagerly accepted as a mental refuge. [Wodak 2016] From this seed developed a network of conspiracy theories that placed Jewish interests, especially those associated with banking, at the center of increasingly grandiose notions.

The availability of the cryptonym of the Illuminati as a cover for anti-Semitism was further fuel for the growth of Wilson's meta-conspiracy through the darker niches of late-20th century counter-culture. [Campion-Vincent 2017]

## Freemasonry and other Fraternities

While the Bavarian Illuminati were not Freemasons, the contact between the two fraternities was extensive, though not always friendly, and this left a permanent echo of Freemasonry in much of the lore surrounding the Illuminati over the following centuries. George Washington acknowledged strains of European Freemasonry influenced by the philosophical notions of the Illuminati (though see above for the reliability of such abstract uses of the name) which then lead further credibility to this linkage.

But Freemasons are notoriously decentralized and any claim that could be made about one Lodge or even Grand Lodge (regional authority) cannot be generally applied to the loose association of Grand Lodges through mutual recognition on the international scale. The divide between "continental Freemasonry" as exemplified by the French Grand Lodge (Grand Orient de France) and the form of Freemasonry originally developed in Ireland, Scotland and England further complicates any attempt to ascribe grand conspiracies to this fractured confederation of fraternal organizations.

In the late 19th century, however, the explosion of fraternal and philosophical societies, even novel religious orders, lead to a renewed interest in conspiracy theory related to their activities. Probably the most well-known of these conspiracies was the Taxil Hoax, which asserted literally Satanic activities among Freemasons complete with highly placed insiders who were delivering private communications from Freemasons to Leo Taxil, a promoter and author in France. Taxil eventually admitted his hoax, and factthat his secretary had been writing all of the supposedly internal communications of Freemasons, but the damage was done and Taxil's hoax became one of the seeds for early 20th century conspiracy theory as it dove-tailed with the German propaganda machine. [Bronner 2019]

There were other societies whose work fueled the esoteric side of the grand conspiracies that would eventually be tied to the name "Illuminati". Two of the most prominent were the Theosophical Society and the Golden Dawn, added a dimension into the discussion: magic. Both societies claimed to teach ancient or revealed magical secrets to their members, and as such fueled the imaginations of many who wrote about them. These influences developed a spiritual dimension to the evolving conspiracy theory strains, dubbed by some researches as "conspirituality". [McLaughlin 1999]

This thread was picked up by several religious groups whose opposition to fraternal orders became a matter of imagined demonic influence, and frequently tied back into existing Illuminati-related conspiracies.

## Conclusion

This is not an exhaustive view of who the Illuminati were or what their influence on modern conspiracy has been by any stretch, but it is this author's hope that exploring the sources of these ideas will help to dispel some of the most blatant examples of bad conspiracy theory and ever so slightly elevate the expectations for those who wish to pose such theories.

I am a conspiracy theorist, a Freemason, an amatuer historian and a lover of truth. To my mind, there can be no greater cause than the quest for truth and uncovering true conspiracies while dispelling those that are false is not the end, but the very start of the journey of understanding.

Mark of beast

The society is on a mission to destroy the peace and balance in the world. They are actively recruiting members to join the satanic group of elites and slowly poison their souls. At this moment in time they are searching for the real "rosemary"
They have managed to destroy my reputation, entangle me with evil spirits and are using the veil of drug usage to explain my body changes. They are bringing officials, in high and low places. They are using body doubles and making a mockery of the justice system by trying to build a case against me by claiming I have miscarried children and am a satanist. They are proud satanists using different celebrities to fuel their agenda. I have been targeted for what reason I do not know but they are making day to day life very hard. They have bugged my home. And like I said paid even the people closest to me to play along with the narrative that I am crazy. They have summoned spirits into my home and they are playing a game with my soul. I write this to warn people to stop fueling the celebrity world. I urge people to be cautious on who you talk to, who you let in to your life. They are evil, vindictive, spiteful, full of hate, envy, and every of sin you can name. They are very sensitive to backlash and very prideful creatures. I would refer to them as humans but no human can truly with a good heart, spirit, soul, or conscious be this way. They will cover up any real truth with lies and deception. They have successfully tried to ruin me. I am not afraid or trying to ruin anyone career but they are testing my limits as a light worker. I have never been more tested in my life and they are making the very docile people even more docile by leading them into darkness. I have seen light and I know wrong from right and these people we are dealing with have worked centuries to destroy any possible bit of truth or faith we may have left. Though they believe they are doing the "right" thing they have an agenda. I have been watched since birth maybe even "groomed" to be this "rosemary" and since they have searched centuries and maybe even screwed with my birth time chart they believe it is me. And though they claim many times they will do anything to make me meet her character traits. They have the wrong person. They have summoned spirits to follow me but say I have "antagonized" them in some way. They wouldn't be following me if they had not summoned them to my exact location and given them my where abouts. My ex fiance, friends, and family have all been paid off and inducted into the society in return for such high standing in society they want to inseminate me with the spirit baby. They have managed to make it look like I miscarry each baby, in hope my reputation will be ruined. They have a body double of me who has worked her whole life to play me so when I either go to jail or am sacrificed no one will notice. They are trying to make me live a life in "isolation" in hopes I will turn cold, hateful, and spread misery when I do go into the world. They continue the narrative of I am a drug using whore who is mentally unstable and emotionally withdrawn just to retract that narrative and say I am senile. I have never done hard drugs in my life. And I have never intentionally miscarried a baby. They made me miscarry my first and only real baby when I was just 16 for what reason I do not know I was an active teen yes. But, I did nothing to miscarry it. My ex fiance has made it a point to try to ruin my reputation even more by telling people in all cities I've been in that I am a cheater and the babies I have "miscarried" were purposeful and because I can't be with him and I do not know who the father of the child is. They have tried to make me internalize these delusions and blame it on the way I dress, talk, and act. They have tried to ruin my medical history by hospitalizing me on multiple occasions because no one was validating what I was feeling and hearing. I am now entangled with a spirit that makes it look like I have a heart beat in my stomach but I have not been with anyone. They have paid people high and low to tell others that I have been with them. They use the method of ECT to get people to go along with this story so when or if asked to take a life detector test they believe their edited video of what is supposed to be my life. They have transcripts of our conversation and have altered them. The video they have of my life is edited. There is a body double of me with every birth mark, tattoo, and hair ( I wear a wig, but they want me to natural by stopping my funds so this body double will be able to look just like me.) If they don't find a way to inseminate me with a evil spirit child they will impregnate my body double and pay people to skew DNA to pin the baby on me. In doing so I would have so much psychological trauma I would repress feelings of anger, resentment, and who knows what to take out on this child that I would have no connection to, and looks nothing like me. With this trauma I would probably not be an active or fit parent so they want to try to open an investigation of child neglect, landing me in prison or begging for some kind of help from the same people who have wronged me. If this does not work they have also paid my nieces to say A)I am either their mother but have forgotten either because of drug use or ECT which they subjected me to or B) say I have groomed and molested them. They are doing everything possible to say I have also groomed my younger brother into incest from the age of 5-14 but in order for me not the make a real romantic connection with someone they change they narrative and say I am still actively have incestial relations with my brother.(I am 25 about to be 26) To add to that narrative they say I am trying to groom my youngest brother into incest because of the way I dress when home  (which is sometimes a robe or booty shorts).    They have made it seem like if I don't go along with agenda of being this "rosemary', having a baby that is not mine, or in some way being a sex slave. (Which doesn't make sense because they reiterate each day that I'm ugly and there are so many other pretty girls along with the notion that "white women are superior" fyi I am an African American woman.) In any of these scenarios or whatever narrative they give that I don't go along with what they say I would go to prison either way. I would like to go on further but this already long.  It is real. 
People I talk to (which isn't many, even though they claim I am some party girl that no one really likes but somehow gets invited to and thrown out of each party) just act naive and in harsh words "retarded' and oblivious to what is going on because they have been paid. . I would like to go on further but this already long. I know some would say speak to a therapist. I have. They have been paid off to intentionally invalidate me. This falls under free speech even though they tell me it will be considered misinformation. Any advice would help or a person to talk too would be better.

Aboriginal Shamans speak of the spirit world and other realms. Science speaks of quantum parallel universes and quantum entanglement. The latter seems to suggest that all things in the universe are one just as the Aboriginals say.

These other dimensions seem to correlate with what shamans refer to as the spirit world, to which they gain access to using psychedelics, tuning their mind to higher frequencies like a radio, and perceiving these dimensions and entities.

If we go by Terence Mckenna's stoned ape theory, it would imply that humans have been accessing these realms for thousands of years, leading to the formation of religions and spirituality. And, throughout the ages have been interpreted (based on the cultural paradigm of the time) as Fairies, Elves, Angels, Demons, and in modern times moreso than not, Aliens.

These dimensions and the beings that reside, have a direct effect on our world...Some of these beings wish to aid us, others seek to harm us. One entity in particular, a Demiurge, has been manipulating the human race, ever since the fall of the The Lost Civilization (read Graham Hancock's work and the source material he references!!!).

As farfetched as all this sounds, the evidence shows that this may very well be the truth. Cognitive Dissonance occurs when people reject reality in order to preserve their belief systems... this allows the Matrix to exist; a system designed to imprison the collective mind, a system created by the Demiurge...

The only way for us to be free, we must awaken from the matrix.

Greetings!

Substances which were controlled for political reasons have always been stigmatized in a moral sense in society. With the Volstead Act, Alcohol was demonized for years, The end result was an explosion in organized crime.  

Prohibition lost advocates as ignoring the law gained increasing social acceptance and as [organized-crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime) violence increased. By 1933, public opposition to prohibition had become overwhelming. In March of that year, Congress passed the [Cullen‚ÄìHarrison Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cullen%E2%80%93Harrison_Act), which legalized "[3.2 beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3.2_beer)" (*i.e.,* beer containing 3.2% alcohol by weight or 4% by volume) and wines of similarly low alcohol content, rather than the 0.5% limit defined by the original Volstead Act.

Congress passed the [Blaine Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaine_Act), a proposed constitutional amendment to repeal the [Eighteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) to end prohibition, in February 1933. On December 5, 1933, [Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah) became the 36th state to ratify the [Twenty-first Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment, voiding the Volstead Act and restoring control of alcohol to the states. In turn, the states have all either made alcohol legal or have passed control over alcohol legality to the counties and provinces that comprise them, leading to the creation of [dry counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_counties), most of which are in the South.

The Opium Laws are another mistake enacted due to Chinese Immigration in the United States. Because of racism, there is now a global heroin smuggling racket, which like alcohol, will continue to enrichen criminals, while legalizing it will knock down drug cartels and allow responsible adults another avenue of relief or recreation:

 

Some Chinese men started coming to the U.S. around 1820, and some larger groups appeared in the 1830s and 40s. These men were coming to America to work as merchants, to mine gold and for other work opportunities. The first Chinese woman to come to America, Afong¬†Moy, arrived [in 1834](http://ethnicstudies.berkeley.edu/documents/wcp%20paper.html). By the 1860s, Chinese immigration [became more common](http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/chinese-immigration/), and Chinese men helped build the First Transcontinental Railroad. The Chinese population on the West Coast grew quickly by the time the railroad began construction. [It is estimated](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/chinese-immigrants-united-states)¬†that between 1850 and 1889, 300,000 Chinese people immigrated to America, though many of them ended up going back to China.¬†

Chinese workers first became a perceived threat to white male workers in the 1870s¬†when [there was a work shortage](http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/chinese-immigration/). White Americans viewed these Chinese men [as racially inferior](http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/exclusion.html) and felt they were taking work away from them. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 banned Chinese immigration for 10 years, and it was extended another 10 years by the Geary Act of 1892. Prejudice against the Chinese in America remained for decades. When Congress passed the [Harrison Tax Act of 1914](http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1910/harrisonact.htm), which effectively outlawed opium nationwide, it was became another measure to gain power over the Chinese population.

**Other drugs derived from opium**¬†

Opium, and the heroin that can be created from the opium poppy, have a long medical history in the country as well. Opium was used to [calm cranky babies](https://io9.gizmodo.com/5896669/when-opium-was-for-newborns-and-bayer-sold-heroin#) in the 1830s and as a treatment for asthma. Morphine, also created from opium, was used as a pain reliever during the Civil War. In 1895, the pharmaceutical company Bayer [synthesized heroin](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/buyers/socialhistory.html) for the first time, and Bayer Heroin was released in 1898. Heroin [was actually a brand name](https://io9.gizmodo.com/5896669/when-opium-was-for-newborns-and-bayer-sold-heroin#) Bayer created, not just some street name for the drug. Since many people became addicted to morphine during and after the Civil War, Bayer Heroin was used as a pain reliever that could help people get rid of their morphine addiction. This backfired. Using heroin for recreational or medicinal uses became illegal in the U.S. under the [Heroin Act of 1924](http://www.naabt.org/laws.cfm).

"Hipster" is not a new term. It originally referred to the jazz players and enthusiasts of the 1930s and beyond. From the hipsters to the beatniks of the 1950s, heroin was often the drug of choice for its euphoric effect. It may no longer be legal, but opium and opium-based drugs are still [widespread](http://www.attn.com/stories/1895/heroin-addiction-painkiller-problem-america?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=internal) in certain places across the U.S. to this day. In fact, Heroin is currently a Schedule I narcotic, along with marijuana, LSD, MDMA and others, which means that is both illegal and classified as having no accepted¬†medicinal use. Opium may have originally become illegal because of Chinese men, but now we can all go to prison for having it.

Legalize all drugs, reduce crime, increase freedom. It is a simple decision. We can defeat criminal drug cartels with drug legalization. It would be better for all.

What do you believe the illuminati is and does?
I'd love to talk about any theories :)
The grand meaning of life? V
It's quite simple really...the whole point has always been to wake you up to see past the illusion that was created long ago. Most theorize that it was set into motion by a secret group of the elite of past eras and other secret cults which is probably close to the truth however understand the simple baseline throughout the entire history of the human race...Death has always been the root factor in driving human behavior throughout time and it has always been a game to one day inspire the future to cheat it. No one wants to die and no one truly ever has. However, the natural learning mistakes of humans, in the past have led us to the current moment where we must commit all these "wrongful" doings to teach us how to obtain the truth, get ahead, or just simply survive. I have personally unlocked it all for myself and I'll provide the 1st step, be honest with yourself and in turn be honest with those around you as much as possible. 

&#x200B;

I have certain proofs to this and much of it is a working theory however I am constantly going forward in life. I've been on a fast rise through my life and it's hard to show you all that I come across however I can tell you a few likely outcomes as of the current pace...each and every person will have to overcome their own horsemen...more truths and symbolic messages will begin to come to light...wars may arise simply because many fear it and it is my own little plan to have governments begin declassifying documents over time. GET READY WORLD :)

Truth.
Nobody in this world is wrong or right. If you live life believing that your heart and mind are in the right place; good things will happen to you. :3
Another truth.
Remember, the current way of living is just slavery with extra steps... Learn the truth and you will see the world for what it really is. All the secret messages and symbolism in life is just hints to one day awaken this power that is inside you.

1. We can be immortal
2. Dreams are possible futures
3. You truly are the master of your own destiny :3
4. Your brain has access to the 4th dimension.
One last thing.
I'm here to help you see the truth about life. If I have to talk to you 1 on 1 to help you reach your true potential I shall do so. DM me...I also have a church discord. (If you're reading this message there is still something bothering you as we speak) o7
The truth
1. The president is not crazy for staying up 1 week handling a world disaster

2. Churchgoers are not insane for speaking in tongues during prayer

3. Humans are ready to evolve and dreams show us what we can become

4. Your brain is a powerful supercomputer attempting to shrink itself down just like our computers. yet we call it "damage" and are told that it's been known for thousands of years that you are dying due to natural causes. In return, our brains misinterpret this input and try so hard to tell your consciousness that it's not dying yet you go crazy b/c you're forced to believe the lies.

5. You literally have the natural ability to live forever and do whatever the hell you please.

6. All the "secrets" are just hints to try and help find that one man to relay this information to you.

7. Our brains communicate together on a deep level you can't see yet ("4th dimension") and it's what causes others to go crazy, start wars, and literally change the course of history as you know it.
L season...Do you guys really want to know the truth about the Illuminati?
I can answer literally anything I have started to unlock access to the rest of my brain and now understand one simple fact. We as humans have always been motivated by death or left to believe that we will just die. Understand that I've figured out the secret codes to live left behind throughout history and now have discovered a way to live FOREVER and let our dreams come to fruition right before our eyes! :3 o7

Indian Illuminati Website redirects to a youtube video
I typed in www.illuminati.in and it redirected me to a certain youtube video. There was a bollywood actor named Sushant Singh who died under mysterious circumstances. It was ruled as suicide but was quickly revealed to be a murder. The culprits have not been caught. The YouTube video is about Salman Khan, another bollywood actor known for his connections to powerful people and his overall enigma as an influencer. Is someone trying to say that Sushant Singh was killed and it has something to do with the Illuminati?

P S: a bollywood actor called Saif Ali Khan is a famous Illuminati believer and has even named his Production House as Illuminati Productions. 

My query: does anyone know anything about Illuminati in India? Any info will be much appreciated. Thanks.

The illuminati (and other secret societies alike) are just a bunch of bored rich people playing pretend or actually have bullshitted themselves into thinking they are special on a spiritual level and just adopt/embrace whatever kind of weird shit the suggestable public think they are doing.
Yes, I do believe the government should be treated with a healthy dose of scepticism. But I also think that the elites are overestimated to the max. I think the main justification for my take is sometimes Power ‚â† Knowledge. There are a lot of dumb rich people out there and many have lost their millions from stupidity and a lack of discipline. Maybe that's why the ones who do make it their whole lives just accumulating their wealth and power emboldens them to feel like they have almost cheated life and are somehow special. I do not actually think these people are special in any capacity other than they are perhaps the most justifiably hated yet lucky mf's on the planet.

Ok so go to this website and set your filters to only show high speed craft, tugs and special craft, unspecified ships, uncheck underway and then turn on the density map which is the bottom tab on the left list.

you can see that every continent has anchored ships around every continent. There are only specific routes being chose for the North and South continents with almost no real travel to the south and North continents. 

Two things the ships being anchored can be a few things but it either effects our supply chain which is whats being pushed or there are military blockades around every single border. The world population is getting up there with governmental leaders at tension with eachother and they are making silent land grabs in order to move population around which brings immigrants to all continents to spread out population so that the spread of a manufactured disease is more effective so billionaires are building space companies to get off world since there are military blockades preventing them from getting the "golden ticket" off of the main continents. So they build space "hotels" with the help of elon musk and other space start ups. So once everything is dome they can either come back to rebuild or go with elons plan and go to mars and start over. This is why I think it was stated that he said he has lost faith in humanity and he states that there is going to be a huge population collapse.

Once everything is in place and they have reached maximum % needed for a full spread then "the great reset" or "the greatest wealth transfer in history" or the "one world government" can take place alot of major buisnesses deal in automation now and algorithms and A.I so a population decrease won't be as much of a hardship for the ones off the mainlands when they comeback after the fall.

The rate at which the technology like nano technology, DNA altering and copying into synthetic RNA and MRNA chains,  just in the last two years been almost forcibly sprung on us when a more acceptable rate would have been as the patents and ground breaks took place. Some of these technologies have been being studied and researched for 50 years or more. How much more technology is being hidden from us that has been R&Ded but was never released. 

Why do you think there is a big push to go all electric and get away from fossil fuels? Cleaner for them after the fall and they wont need it their tech is faster smarter and way more advanced than what the everyday person has. The gas is for us to use to melt more ice caps on the north and south continets so that there is livable land in those regions why do you think they are called caps? Why not just say it's melting the snow at the poles? Or its melting that ice at the poles? It's always melting the polar ice caps. Because they are caping the land underneath. 

now we have reached our usefulness and are no longer required as to their mind set. Hopefully I'm dead wrong ü§∑ maybe its just something I threw together in my head real quick? ü§î but you gotta admit it goes with alot of other things that have been going on with certian mainstream billionaires  and millionaires... I could go on but i think this is enough to at least get the ball rolling on a conversation?

What do the Illuminati believe about the after life....
if the illuminati are satanic does that mean they are going to hell.  Do they believe in heaven and hell and god.  What are there beliefs in the afterlife?
Does everyone here believe Illuminati is Evil?
**Hello Redditors**, I am a firm believer in Illuminati and I have read many conspiracy theories regarding them... I used to believe in the conspiracy theories, but at this Point of Time, I believe Illuminati is REAL, but I don't believe they're evil Devil Worshippers.  
What do you guys think? Do you believe Illuminati is Real? And if so, do you believe they are Good or Evil? I personally believe they might be misunderstood.

Have you ever been approached by an Illuminati member on Reddit?
One guy chatted me on Reddit as Illuminati and invited me to become a member. Even tho I was every second 100% convinced it's a scam, he never asked for any money. I took the play and made an oath with artificial text to voice speech, I gave him fake ID I made in Photoshop and everything. But they are still going for 7 days now with their plans and stories about illuminati. If it's a scam, why are they losing their time even after they got what they want (ID documents)? And regarding money - never asked for this.

Have you ever been approached by those weirdos? Btw they claim they are located in Washingtoj DC, and yet they are 100% not US citizens as they write "loose" instead of "lose", a common English mistake made by foreigners.

I once saw a video talking about flies landing on the heads of high ups during interviews. People like Hillary Clinton and others.   When that Mike pence fly thing happened I was like "wtf I remember watching a video about that". But now I can not find a single video on the subject and I can't find one person talking about it.

The Light exists within.
As someone who has been chasing enlightenment for years and years, I've only found that bright spot of light inside my own mind.

Only when I try to reach out to a mind greater do I ever see anything. Sometimes sitting quietly is all one needs. Buddha taught this same principle.

Taoism teaches that one can know the ways of heaven without leaving one's door. The farther one travels the less one knows.

What is the Illuminati
So for a long time I‚Äôve watched conspiracies and theories behind songs, celebrities, movies etc that are in the Illuminati but what is it actually? What happens to us when we are exposed to this? Do these people actually sell their soul to the Devil? And if so what happens to them?
If people think Illuminati doesn‚Äôt exist then why is this at a school .. no, I‚Äôm not putting location for reasons we all know

Most of you are talking about the political illuminati that existed 100 years ago among presidents.
The modern illuminati has nothing to do with Presidentual secrecy and some secret  societies .  The  free masanaries, or religious conformity as old times once taught us in history books or college lectures  . The modern illuminati is about power , money , control and global take over.  This is attached to drug trafficking, child pernography , human solicitation, child solicitation, political control, the entertainment industry, huge corporations like Disney,  Ford,  Bill gates , drug and food administrators,  CDC , international trade and the federal banking administrators, judicial systems and federal officials  , the illuminati is real just not the same one we were told about in school or on the discovery channel. That  Illuminati was a secret society among presidents of historical times.  

I was a manager in the entertainment industry for 23 years and this is not a subject thst should be taken lightly or discuss so openly . The truth is you wouldn't believe the people who are envolved and connected in this elite group of people. They have  even scouted out the little people you would never imagine would be effilulated with the illuminati.  Question ? who do think are the ones they use to do there dirty work ? The people no one  suspects.  So it's best to just keep your faith and just worry about you stay away from digging to deep into this they have been doing this for hundreds of years. These societies have been controlling our government and financial institutions for longer then we can imagine . The illuminati has  expanded and has grown  more power then ever due to internet and social media and international merge ,  but at the same time , there playing  the devils advocate, because the one thing that made them more powerful also has become there worst enemy,  they have become desperate these past  10 years do to the internet and social media as it has also exposed them , and has them running in circles making it harder for then to Stay discreet and unknown .
Reason for division?
How does one determine what they perceive as freedom. The way that the world is designed is one that gives you the illusion of choice based on you being given the freedom to choose one of two options that are given to you to choose from. Now these are usually problems or systems created that are purposely made to divide the public by separating the ‚Äúsupporters‚Äù against the ¬®opposers¬®.. the system is what I refer to as a pendulum that needs both positive and negative energy to keep the system operational.. the systems or pendulums don't care if you are a supporter or opposer.. it needs both to survive..

If you actually look at most any topic and issue that is in the news today.. These are all issues that almost demand division by bating that you take a side.. By opposing or supporting the manufactured system or pendulum.. (which is actually any created problem, crisis or issue) a confirmed real crisis, problem or issue) it's not until you have both a positive and negative energy given to the system on both sides that it gives it life.

This is done so much and so often by the msm that you are not only unaware of it happening but you have subconsciously have now become to actually take on the stance and side of whatever issue that you now are not only in support or against but don‚Äôt even realize you were programmed to have that belief without you even knowing it.

Let‚Äôs take any issue in the news.. You are against the border crisis.. Well you are a trumper that hates immigrants. If you don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine or wear a mask.. Well then you all of a sudden are insensitive to the greater good and only care about yourself.

Our entire politcal system is made to divide us by giving us two candidates and two primary political parties to choose from‚Ä¶ Everything is made for us to have two options and thats what creates the system or pendulum by design.. the division is not just a byproduct but essential. The positive and negative energies is what turns the manufactured problem into a real confirmed problem.. 

I believe that there are more than two options for everything.. that the two option world of solutions only creates division instead of unity.. and I personally don't align with republican or democrat but I align with what i believe in regards to the issue.. I don't ride a party line or adhere to the two solutions only world.. when we stop giving energy of either positive or negative to the systems.. they seize to exist.. but in order for that to happen.. You must first see what the systems are.. then see the objective.. then instead of opposing or supporting.. redirect your energy to creating or we can co-create the new world we want to live in

Operation Mindfuck - The Origins of Illuminati
What is r/illuminati's take on the Adam Curtis documentary *"Cant Get You Out of My Head"*, and specifically it's dismantling of the Illuminati Conspiracy Theory, as an elaborate troll by discordian pranksters working at Playboy magazine in the 70's? 

It seems that this entire theory of the Illuminati was a big prank, entitled ***"Operation Mindfuck",*** created by writers and artists who wanted to prove the utter ridiculousness of conspiracy theories by *creating* one that was so outlandish it would be impossible to believe. 

Of course, this has gone horribly wrong. *Operation Mindfuck* achieved the exact opposite of what those responsible for it wanted to achieve. 

Thanks to Kerry Thornley, Greg Hill and Robert Anton Wilson, now the world is full of people who believe the globe is secretly controlled by the shady sect none as none other than the *Illuminati*.

When you became empty within, how did you find the light?
I'm at a point where I've lost the majority of my emotions in attachments to that around me. I haven't reached any major realization or found enlightenment or anything of that nature, but over the years my spiritual practices and contemplation have put me at the bottom of a hill with self identity, where the old will never return and the new is yet to come, and overall I am more or less becoming an empty husk of a human.

 I feel that the next step on the stairs is near and when it comes it will be a great flood that is overwhelming in magnitude, but it is something that while right in front of me is also an infinite distance. 

I'm sure there's many on here who have experienced this rut of emptiness, and to those of you who found the light at the end of the endless tunnel, how?

How to be an evolutionary:
At the end of two solid years of research into the claims of what is happening in our world, how it all works, and what is worthwhile, an ontology I have uncovered that guides an individual to embody the divine process of Becoming and can be illustrated as follows.

There are, for an evolutionary, three distinct ways of Becoming. They are, Personal Evolution, Collective Evolution, and Experience and Expression.

When you aren't sure of a path forward in any domain, the way can be made clear through following one of these three paths. Together, they curate the possibility of Becoming and all positively impact the others.

The Greatest Act of Love in 2000 Years
I was pondering the Earth's weakening magnetic field, the approaching galactic wave, and the micronova it could trigger, and then I remembered why I was there. I wasn't sure I was a Watcher of course, but it felt true.

He was about to speak to a countless multitude.

Behind me I heard two desperate sounding men say to each other that the New Order may not be able to withstand such a black swan event.

Then he began.

&#x200B;

>The *Native American* tribes did it to *each other*, and then the *European* tribes did it to *them*.  
>  
>Tribalism, dominance, and conformism have been with us since before we were human. It is the way of animals. It is their peak.  
>  
>Nobility made us human. Tolerance, openness, and independence made us human. Honesty, progress, responsibility, peace, and courage. It is the way of men. It is our peak.  
>  
>The soul of humanity had been supplanting the soul of animals in each generation, until one day, in 1945, all the tribes of men said, Enough! Never Again!

&#x200B;

I could not distinguish the gasps of hope from the gasps of horror.

&#x200B;

>There would be no more wars of conquest. No more genocides. No more atrocities. No more ethnic cleansing. No more apartheid states. Never Again!

&#x200B;

I had a second to bask in the glow, but suddenly, many in the crowd became enraged, and I am sure that in all the jostling I saw a tail disappear under the long coat of one man, and the one next to him, though his eyes and head were covered, looked .... off. Another kind of watcher perhaps.

&#x200B;

>We thus forgive all that ended before the great epiphany, but then some European invaders did it again! And they are still doing it! And humanity is forced to look the other way!  
>  
>The occupied *always* have the right to fight back, but the occupiers only have the right to leave.  
>  
>I am one of those European invaders, and today I will walk back to Europe.  
>  
>Whatever happens, do not hate those who would stop me.  
>  
>Everyone is beautiful. Everyone is good.  
>  
>More specifically, the best version of everyone is beautiful, and the best version of everyone is good.  
>  
>They are just in a bad place. They have lost their way.  
>  
>We were all there once.  
>  
>Everyone is being played.  
>  
>The Apex Players are turning us into the worst version of ourselves. They try to make us dislike, distrust, and distance each other, so that we are looking at each other instead of looking at them, and so that we cannot unite against them.  
>  
>They do not want us to know that it is within everyone's power to instantly find their way again.  
>  
>Everyone is redeemable--even the Apex Parasites.  
>  
>This is temporary. It is not who they really are or who they really want to be.  
>  
>When you see someone. Think to yourself, "The light in me is allied with the light in you."

&#x200B;

He handed the mic to another man.

&#x200B;

>I am one of the occupied, and I will walk with you my brother. I will be your shield.

&#x200B;

The raw emotion was overwhelming. Most were embracing strangers and crying .... okay .... I was too.

I checked and none of the mainstream news sources were carrying this live, and then I lost my internet connection. Apparently the global Internet kill switch had been activated, but I think they were too late.

We had just witnessed the greatest act of love in 2000 years.

The mutually-reinforcing downward spiral was turning into a mutually reinforcing upward spiral.

As a critical mass became the best version of themselves .... as the plays became less effective .... as the the psyops failed more often .... there was a horizon coming into view .... a golden age .... a world in which the Apex Players had become irrelevant.

this  netflix show got cancelled.... wonder why
I have an idea that would greatly benefit humanity, the planet, cut back on carbon footprint and i am not sure where to begin. I have been stargazing lately at el: 30 az:165 opiphicus constellation and this concept, thought and idea just lit up. Its like a theoretical light was turned on.

Enlightenment.
Religious and spiritual belief systems were created out of early civilisation's need to explain their perceived world. This is an inherent quality of humanity.

The problem is that early civilisation did not have the benefit of modern science to inform their ideas. Hence, they postured ideologies of the human soul, spirit and belief systems as it was the best way they could describe what they perceived as the ethereal qualities of the mind, the dynamics of human nature that it instilled and the world around them.

Early civilisation lived in the same world we do so would you now, based on your current perspective and knowledge of contemporary science, form the same ideologies humanity did thousands of years ago. Remove that precursor philosophy of mysticism and theology from the equation and it would seem obvious that any reasonable person would not.

The later extrapolation of these ideologies resulted in religion and spiritual belief systems. Over time these ideas have been intellectualised into complex doctrine. Unfortunately, this has meant that such doctrine has become the focus of humanities perspective and we have forgotten about its origins. Ever heard the saying 'can't see the forest for the trees'?

So, if we take our minds back to consider early civilisation reasoning then we can see clearly, at least on a fundamental level, why these belief systems are the way they are today.

This perspective allows us to see such belief systems in the true context of humanities ageless struggle to define ourselves and our world. It can be enticing to conceive our world as having a mystical component to it but regrettably that is not the case.

Looking at various things with an open perspective can realise many things.

Religion and belief doctrine is much like the ethical and behavioural models you get in most workplaces these days. Imagine how complex conduct and behavioural policy in the workplace would be if a particular employer had thousands of years to work up that policy.

Religion and belief systems also have rites and practices. These practices are essentially self-actualisation models designed to discipline the mind. They can be useful if you undertake them with that in mind; they are not necessarily the path to a higher divine or spiritual awakening.

As an example, if you constantly meditated about a distinct ‚Äòspiritual being‚Äô, separate to the body, you might work yourself up to a state of what appears to be spiritual awareness; but you have essentially indulged yourself in a form of intellectual masturbation with a crescendo resulting in your utter belief in your ‚Äòspiritual being‚Äô.      

Enlightenment is knowing yourself; what your ‚Äòbeing‚Äô actually consists of, your place in humanities long history, the true context of that history and objectively acknowledging the varied perspectives that formed along the way to inform humanities intellectual growth and understanding of ourselves, society and civilisation.

The absence of religious and spiritual belief systems does lead to despair; by actively engaging in and conversing about such things you are participating in a long search for the truth of reality which has been a keystone of civilisation throughout human history. factyou realise this makes you an integral part of that process and a part of that long journey; it makes you a true Illuminati.
May i ask for help channeling or manifesting energy to strengthen my bridge to my higher self to be more self aware of myself, this dimension, reality, and humanity

Time matters.
Intermodulation (IM) is caused by the non-linear behaviour of signal processing in the brain.  The brain is a nonlinear, or time variance system, and it's intermodulation products form the mind.  Without time their is no intermodulation and therefore no mind or consciousness.
Perspective matters.
There exists a perspective continuum within which an individual‚Äôs conscience resides.  Our individual perspectives determine our place on the perspective continuum.  Where perspectives differ, there is potential to breach the ‚Äòperspective gap‚Äô and reach a mutual understanding (‚Äòperspective gain‚Äô).  The greater the ‚Äòperspective gap‚Äô the more difficult it is to realise or manifest that ‚Äòperspective gain‚Äô.  Therefore, it follows that a lesser ‚Äòperspective gap‚Äô is easier to span and reach a shared perspective. 

I call the concept of realising ‚Äòperspective gain‚Äô ‚Äòperspective mining‚Äô.  The interesting thing about ‚Äòperspective mining‚Äô is that it is subject to the ‚Äòobserver effect‚Äô in which the view of another perception is tainted by the bias of the observer and may change the interpretation of what is actually being considered or conceived resulting in misunderstanding. 

This misunderstanding, particularly where the observer is perceiving a limited view or event, can lead to conflict between opposing views.  Conversely, the ‚Äòobserver effect‚Äô can seem to reveal great insights where a limited perspective or event informs a broader perspective i.e., something appears to be miraculous or mystical where a finite idea or event aligns with the broader beliefs or concepts of the observer. 

The trick with ‚Äòperspective mining‚Äô is to recognise we are all placed somewhere on the perspective continuum and that our own bias will likely affect what we are perceiving.  Through this process, we can change the focus from merely recognising differences to seeking ‚Äòperspective gain‚Äô or mutual understanding. 

Our goal should be understanding our place on the perspective continuum and seeking wisdom from other perspectives in the context of our own.  I believe that this will allow for a higher shared consciousness, 'being' or 'humanity', within each of us.   

Contemporary theology sometimes talks about a future age of enlightenment, reincarnation and the realisation of ‚ÄòGod‚Äôs‚Äô plan. I see these prophesised revelations as merely a return to what we should have already known. We are physical beings with the capacity to move beyond the constraints of our physical self to reach a higher meaning.

By being ‚Äòperspectively‚Äô aware and acknowledging that our characteristics are the forms of a physical process we can see past our own bias and come to know ourselves and others for what we really are; beings capable of understanding or wisdom.
Mind matters.
The concept of what our ‚Äòbeings‚Äô consist of has been an ageless debate. As civilisation has progressed society has developed a sense of ‚Äòbeing‚Äô founded in source elements of ancient philosophy. Based on these views it is a widely held belief that a person has a distinct soul and spirit separate from the body.

As these concepts were first postured thousands of years ago, without the insight of modern science, it is a revealing experience to revisit these core tenets in the context of how they were originally conceived.

As an example I will talk to the perspective of the Ancient Greeks. In Ancient Greece the soul was synonymous with the spirit and standardly thought and spoken of as the distinguishing mark of living things, as something that is the subject of emotional states and that is responsible for planning and practical thinking, and also as the bearer of such virtues as courage and justice.

I contend that this early ideology was simply an early attempt to classify what is now fundamentally now known to be the human mind. This is understandable as the mind would have seemed to be an ethereal form in the context of limited information on the physiology of the brain and body. In fact, Aristotle is known to have thought that the heart was the location of intelligence and that the brain was some sort of radiator.

I would argue that Ancient Greek conceptualisation of the soul was actually a practical attempt to express the dynamics or aspects of the mind; an early iteration of psychology.

If we accept the above premise then it would seem logical to conclude that the contemporary concept of a distinct soul and spirit is fundamentally flawed, having being based on an earlier concept born out of humanities attempt to classify what the ‚Äòmind‚Äô is.

As a perspective experiment contemplate this in the context of other Ancient philosophy. Literally replace the word and meaning of soul or spirit with the word mind. I think you will understand my point. 

This does not diminish our sense of self but instead brings it into focus. Would not being aware that the mind is essentially the manifestation of our soul or spirit bring us closer to our true selves?

Easy Guide to the Layers of the Mind
Hello all! Have you ever wondered how the mind works? It's actually exceedingly simple. There are 5 "layers" to the mind. I created a very simple pictorial representation and video explaining it: https://youtu.be/zsGRno7Ht84

This discusses not only how the mind works but why there is so much confusion in the world. What's the "normal" way people think the mind works and what's the actual way? Why do people get what "they don't want"? It has to do with the mechanics of the innermost ring of the mind: DESIRE.

If you don't feel like watching the video, I will sum up the five layers of the mind here. These go from outermost to innermost. Outermost being the layer that we are "on" so to speak, that we experience first, and that springs from all the layers below it. 

This is a non-dualistic teaching, so we understand that the universe is within the mind. The outermost layer of the mind is PERCEPTION. This is the world you "see" around you. The people, places and things. It's a world of symbolic images.

Underneath the outermost layer we find EMOTION this is what we find directly underneath the layer of perception. These EMOTIONS fall on a spectrum, a scale with love and fear being at the two ends.

Going further, we next find our THOUGHTS. Our THOUGHTS are directly under and cause our EMOTIONS. If I think fear-based thoughts, I will feel the EMOTION of fear and in turn I will have a fearful PERCEPTION.

Now, what's under that? You guessed it -- BELIEF. BELIEF is under the layer of THOUGHT in the mind. What we think is determined by what we BELIEVE and subsequently all the layers above that. 

We're finally at the innermost ring of the mind. This is the figurative bullseye. This ring is DESIRE. Everything, without exception, comes from DESIRE. We can desire to experience whatever we want. One important lesson we learn, though, is that our DESIRE can not change reality. We can only have an illusory experience based on it, i.e. the universe. Source or Nirvana does not change based on our DESIRE, and there -- we are without it.

Thanks guys for reading/watching, I go into these and more in much further depth in the video, I recommend you watch if you haven't as it's extremely helpful. As always though, I'm here for any questions or discussion either way. (FYI, If your comment is an ad hominem or similarly valueless statement, I may not respond)

How to cultivate good vibes in the morning

Addressing the hard questions wherever they may lead
As an ardent Christian my whole life; there were certain facts that not only did I ignore, I just didn‚Äôt want to know about. 

About a year ago, I embarked on a journey, not just for myself, but for anyone that wanted to come along: and on this journey I was met with questions from various subscribers that honestly - I couldn‚Äôt ignore any longer and I needed to delve into further... if I were so strong in my faith then why would I be afraid to look into them: questions like the origins and authenticity of the Bible for example... and after months of research I couldn‚Äôt deny what I had found as much as it pained me and left me asking for more questions. 

It‚Äôs not my intent to derail anyone‚Äôs faith.. but factof the matter is, is that it *has* been a book that in the name of a God who‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt even really Jesus as that name never existed before the father of freemasonry and Rosicrucian Francis Bacon - the ‚Äúguiding spirit behind the founding of America‚Äù created it... in fact before the name of Jesus was written in the Bible; there was no letter J. It was created for the purpose of his name, which translated correctly - translates to Joshua. Jesus or Iesus was translated from the Greek, which also has a translation of its own which is not Jesus or Iesus. 

It is said that Francis Bacon the true Shakespeare has left us clues, that‚Äôs leads us towards the true purpose of the founding of this nation is as a sort of treasure hunt; this is documented by many historians; and [this](https://youtu.be/wE75eQh8fPM) is just my attempt at continuing to find the truth, wherever that may lead. I won‚Äôt stifle my findings; even if they lead me to places I wouldn‚Äôt imagine they would

I have no other agenda other than that, if my findings are in error, then please - let me me know.

Is it possible that those at the top are actually the good guys?

Consider that they would never have been able to gain and maintain global dominance and secrecy if they were primarily motivated by greed or other petty emotions. They must therefore be true believers.

Though it may be tempting to observe their front men and lieutenants and see that most of them appear to be motivated by greed, power, and other weaknesses of character; that does not prove that those at the top are the same. Their deeds may look evil to the uneducated eye, but if we consider the longer term and the bigger picture, they are merely using these front men as a means to an end--a noble end.

If they allowed the world to be the best it could be, then innovation would solve every problem just like always, and we wouldn't have to worry, and we wouldn't have to work hard--*we wouldn't have to try*. We would imagine ourselves to be brave individuals having character beyond reproach, but in reality our courage and character would never have been put to the test. We would rarely have had to overcome adversity, and we wouldn't be reading any philosophy. We would be too busy making money and having fun. We would be as worthless as trust fund babies or the boss's son.

Although their plans and manipulations reward psychopaths while hobbling those having the best character (e.g. independent thinkers who question authority), you will see that the end justifies the means because the future of humanity depends on their success. Therefore, they must do whatever is necessary to stop anyone from derailing their noble plans, which will thus at times seem tyrannical.

Likewise, they cannot allow anyone who might challenge their noble plans to have any real power, wealth, fame, or influence.

It is easy to mistake their manipulations as a means to identify those individuals who will speak out, and it is easy to mistake their manipulations as a plan to breed us into productive but obedient servants who could never unite against them, and I guess at some level that is technically what is happening, but that will never come to pass--there isn't enough time.

What they are actually doing is creating an environment that will identify those individuals who have the intelligence, the independent mindedness, and the strength of character to see through all of their manipulations--to pierce the illusion legitimacy. They are hoping such individuals will self-identify by exercising the courage to publicly call them out, and that ultimately, such individuals will figure out their real motives and love them.

They are doing this because they know we have somewhere between 10 and 50 years before a cosmic catastrophe kills over 90% of humanity, and they may only be able to save a few million, so they are desperately trying to find the best of humanity, and that is who they will save, and that is who will help them rebuild.

However, they have become so desperate, because so few have figured it out, that they are letting me tell you this, or else you would be reading it.

New translation, from the original German, of original book of Illuminati writings, "Einige Originalschriften Des Illuminaten Ordens", first published in 1786.
>...And let's again go back to the first days of the (Bavarian) Illuminati. Because Britain and France were the two greatest world powers in the late years of the 18th Century, **Weishaupt** ordered the Illuminati to foment the colonial wars, including our Revolutionary War, to weaken the British Empire and organize the French Revolution to destroy the French empire. He scheduled the French Revolution to start in 1789. However, in 1784, a true act of God placed the Bavarian government in possession of evidence which proved the existence of the Illuminati and that evidence could have saved France if they, the French government, hadn't refused to believe it.

>Here is how that act of God happened. It was in 1784 that Weishaupt issued his orders for the French Revolution. A German writer, named Zwack, put it into book form. It contained the entire Illuminati story and Weishaupt's plans. A copy of this book was sent to the Illuminists in France headed by Robespierre whom Weishaupt had delegated to foment the French Revolution.

>The courier was struck and killed by lightening as he rode through Rallestown on his way from Frankfurt to Paris. The police found the subversive documents on his body and turned them over to the proper authorities. After careful study of the plot, the Bavarian government ordered the police to raid Weishaupt's newly organized Lodges of the Grand Orient and the homes of his most influential associates.

>All additional evidence thus discovered convinced the authorities that the documents were genuine copies of the conspiracy by which the Illuminati planned to use wars and revolutions to bring about the establishment of a one-world government, the powers of which they, headed by the Rothschilds, intended to usurp as soon as it was established, exactly in line with the United Nations plot of today.

>In 1785, the Bavarian government outlawed the Illuminati and closed the Lodges of the Grand Orient. In 1786, they published all the details of the conspiracy. The English title of that publication is **"The Original Writings of the Order and the Sect of the Illuminati."** Copies of the entire conspiracy were sent to all the heads of church and state in Europe. But the power of the Illuminati, which was actually the power of the Rothschilds, was so great that this warning was ignored. Nevertheless, the Illuminati became a dirty word and it went underground.

Recently Terry Melanson, author of [Perfectibilists: The 18th Century Bavarian Order of the Illuminati](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0977795381/), has posted, in parts linked below, an English translation of "The Original Writings of the Order and the Sect of the Illuminati" (as referenced by Myron), titled ["Einige Originalschriften Des Illuminaten Ordens"](http://www.iisg.nl/collections/secretsocieties/images/d1074-13.jpg) in the original German, and translated as (more correctly) "Some Original Writings Of The Order of the Illuminati" by Melanson.

As far as I can tell, this is the first true to form English translation of this book available online. The book predates [John Robisons "Proofs Of A Conspiracy"](https://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/pc/index.htm), and also "The Protocols of The Elders of Zion". "Some Original Writings..." is generally accepted and thought of as genuine, unlike the Protocols, though some certainly still debate the extent to which the Protocols are fake.

Melanson has made 4 posts so far this year, I'm not sure if the project is yet complete, but here are the posts:

Finding your way
When you find your way, you will live in peace.

You will no longer obsess over sex, power, wealth, image, or material things.

You will no longer be controlled by emotion.

You will be on the path to the best version of yourself--to your future self.

You will know that being on the path is enough to inspire others to find their way.

You will no longer live in fear of death.

You will accept that your journey will someday end, and that it may end unexpectedly, but you will know that you were on the path, and thus you did what you could to leave the universe better than if you had never existed, and you will know that it was enough.

How can you feel anything but gratitude for having had that opportunity?

The players who hide the path are legion, and their power is without precedent, but no matter what they do, you always have the power within you to instantly find your way again.

Everyone has different gifts, but even if one of your gifts is to weaken the players--perhaps by shining a light on them--even such a noble battle will never be you primary mission. The real battle is inside you.
How the Illuminati came to be the catch-all term for over-arching conspiracy theory
A little while back someone in one of the "ask" subreddits wanted to know how this modern meme took root. Since I've been studying this for a while, I decided to respond. I thought my response (slightly expanded) could be of interest here, as well.

The goal, here, is *not to fully explore the history of the Illuminati conspiracy theory development*, but rather to focus on the transition from actual historical organization to the uber-conspiracy most know it as today.

----

Edit: TL;DR for those who don't want to go through all of this: 18th century Bavarian political and philosophical society -> philosophical trends of the early 19th century -> mid-19th century academic conspiracy theories about the French Revolution -> Late 20th century pop conspiracy fiction -> fringe conspiracy terminology -> hip hop cultural adaptation -> modern social media conspiracy theory. Details follow; references at the end.

----

There are many reasons ranging from pop culture of the 1970s to George Washington's personal correspondence to French politics. I'll try to cover some of the high points, but a truly comprehensive treatment of the reasons is probably impossible in a comment on Reddit.

It's important to know, just to start that [Adam Weishaupt's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt) [Bavarian Illuminati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati) were one of many branches in the underground current of continental Europe's intellectual push against monarchy and the church at that time. To think of it as the "source" of their anti-monarchy and anti-clerical views is missing the forest while staring at a tree.

I make this point because it's often said that the Illuminati continued on after their dissolution, as an intellectual tradition that informed the [Jacobites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobitism) and other similar groups in the early 19th century. This is... highly debatable, but what isn't debatable is that that intellectual movement that the Illuminati were born from (and involved several people in its founding and formation, not just Adam Weishaupt) was also formative for many other similar traditions. [*If you wish to follow the history of early Illuminati conspiracy theory regarding the Jacobites, I recommend [this article](https://theconversation.com/simoninis-letter-the-19th-century-text-that-influenced-antisemitic-conspiracy-theories-about-the-illuminati-134635)*]

But, at the time, many people didn't make that nuanced distinction, and there are letters from the time (George Washington's letter to American Freemasons being one of the most well known) where it's clear that this intellectual movement was just being called the Illuminati. Whether this was widespread is less clear, but it was very much a documented occurrence.

Because of the tumult in France during their revolution, there was significant fear among other monarchies of a similar event elsewhere and so it is likely that this was the cause of some continued popularity of the use of the name. Over time that name became a placeholder, especially in academic circles, for this larger fear of anti-monarchy and anti-clerical political and philosophical currents which could give rise to future revolution.

But it was rarely used in the mainstream of a century until the 1970s saw the creation of Robert Anton Wilson's Illuminatus! Trilogy. This book's influence, if looked at objectively, post-facto is absurdly large. Wilson took elements of dozens of historical organizations, conspiracy theories and intellectual traditions and blended them into a comedy/sci-fi story that became a staple of 1970s and 80s university counter-culture along with less long-term recognizable names such as the Anarchist's Cookbook, Principia Discordia and the various Bob Dobs/Church of the Subgenius materials. It was where the term Illuminati transformed from a vague notion of a political/philosophical current in 19th century Europe to the unified conspiracy theory that is widely touted today.

It had commercial help in this. Steve Jackson Games published a board/card game in the 1980s based on the book and later, during the Magic: The Gathering craze, revised the game as a collectable trading card game with updated political satire for the 1990s. Both products saw reasonable success, appearing in most hobby shops in the US during their peaks.

But it was the adoption of this mostly fringe fascination with the now completely transformed cultural meme named the Illuminati by 2000s hip hop culture that brought it out of the college dorm room and into the general public consciousness.

And that brings us to the online conspiracy culture of the 2010s where "Illuminati" was already a well-entrenched cultural meme, available to such a wide segment of society that it's probably better known at this point than any other piece of conspiracy terminology.

Illuminati ''theory''
Excuse me for asking you people a perhaps a stupid question,  but aren't the illuminati the good guys? After doing some research on the Internet, I came to the conclusion that they definetly should be. According to the conspirecy-theroies (which should so highly be all incorrect) they want a control-system in which we all would be slaves of the ruling elite, while the rest of the human population would remain in ignorance, to make it easier for them to control of us.
But according to history they have always been wanting the opposite. (they were even anarchists) it lies a little bit in the word that they are for spiritual (and intellectual) enlightenment, but they always were though, against the catholic church and a bit sceptical to the catholic influence opun the world, because they (the catholic church) are limited in their belief and a little bit back in the day. All since the rennaissance, they (the illuminati) were against the catholic influence, but instead endorced more of the Jewish traditions (and today, Zionism, which pretty much is updated Jewism)
Being for spiritual (as well as intellectual) enlightenment, they're probably not likely be the bad guys here...
To put it simply, they are (underground as the group sadly is) still, and always was, for enlightenment for human race, and nothing else...
Seems like David Icke have gotten a little bit wrong...

How do the cultural vibes of the Freemasonry groups, Hermetic groups, and the Illuminati groups differ? They all seem to attract and absorb different types of people.

Why are the works of Weishaupt not readily available to the public?
We can buy almost any title on Amazon, yet when it comes to someone who arguably played a serious role in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century thought, we have almost nothing? There are popular editions of Rousseau and Voltaire on Amazon, but not Weishaupt? Even when the Illuminati has gained mainstream recognition through people like Robert Anton Wilson and Dan Brown no one wants to publish the Bavarian professor?

You shouldn't fear/worry about the Illuminati
Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

TLDR; After studying the "illuminati" since about 2005, I can safely say it does not exist.

&#x200B;

This is a subject that I have put to rest ( mentally) for several years. I am going to briefly touch on my understanding and what I've learned about the Illuminati ( minus the common knowledge that you should know).

&#x200B;

It doesn't exist. There is no "Illuminati". Essentially, the "Illuminati" are several powerful factions that control enormous resources, borders, laws etc. 

&#x200B;

**To give you a snapshot of who these groups are:**

&#x200B;

\- The Catholic Church

\- The United States

\- World Bank/IMF/ International Bank of Settlements / Central Banks

\- The Pentagon/Air Force

\- The British Government/ Monarchy

\- Multinational Conglomerates ( Monsanto, Exxon Mobil, BP, HSBC etc)

\- Cartels and Consortiums ( i.e Oil, Guns, Diamonds etc)

\- Courts/Legal Monopoly

&#x200B;

These groups are quite often "at war" with each other and do not necessarily agree, share or cooperate in any fashion. If you have ever seen how "governments" communicate internally ( i.e regional to state, or Federal to state) you would realize there is no conspiracy or homogeneity in governing or "controlling". 

&#x200B;

When people refer to the "Illuminati", in my opinion, they are referring to the **Anglo-American "Corporation"** which is essentially the corporations ( nations) of USA, UK, Canada, Australia, NZ its governments, corporations and elite families ( like the Rockefellers, Bushs etc) as well. 

&#x200B;

The scary reality is, there is no Big Brother Watching you, at least as a single entity, there are several to hundreds watching you all in different fashions ( Police, Banks, Google, Customs, IRS, your company etc). These organizations do not "work together" and you only need to be in danger to find out how poorly organized our society really is.

&#x200B;

For instance, the Police have practically zero ability to requisition anything personal about you, even if they did it takes months and will likely need litigation. 

&#x200B;

It boils down to knowledge. But it is exercised through Money and the Law. This is the Illuminati. 

&#x200B;

The "Illuminati" are basically breakaway organizations from the rabble of the earth. The only reason they are still located in X country is because they have to have an HQ somewhere. Much like Libertarians, Corporations also seek to be free of the banks, governments and employees that run them. The Banks are the same etc.

&#x200B;

Here is what you need to be legitimately "afraid" of: Local Government.

&#x200B;

Yes, you heard me. LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

&#x200B;

This entity can take your kids, arrest you ( almost arbitrarily), can raise your taxes, cut your water off, power, deprive you of healthcare, imprison you, seize your assets, condemn your home, rezone your community or SELL out your hometown or region.

&#x200B;

Why are you worrying about symbols, global corruption, the banks and some fucking weird Bavarian Story from 1760 when complete "DUMBASSES" have a monopoly on your everyday life.

&#x200B;

Ask yourself this question:

&#x200B;

How many times do you actually interact with the Federal Government or its agents? 

How many times do you actually interact with State/Provincial Government or its agents?

How many times do you interact with local government agents? 

&#x200B;

Most North American interactions with Federal entities is Taxes, their passport and when they leave/return the country period. 

&#x200B;

Local Government quite often, is the one that will trample your rights and "eat out your substance". Its done quietly, without much thought or experience and with little public attention or interest.

&#x200B;

All the attention goes to the Federal Branch ( i.e Whitehouse). Have you EVERY FUCKING READ WHAT YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES- daily?

&#x200B;

In my opinion, if their is an Illuminati, they have no power. The power rests in local government, particularly local governments that have "numerous" arms, departments and scopes, they always rob your liberties and habitually lower your wealth. 

&#x200B;

**Take Away**

The above groups I mentioned do not care about you. They are incredibly short sighted. All they want is your money, they want it now. This is the great conspiracy. It is not the Illuminati, it is basic human nature. We live in a world of power and submission, haves and have nots. 

&#x200B;

They don't care about you, none of these actors. Just like you don't care about them. When was the last time you did anything helpful to your community? Running for cancer doesn't count lol. So why do you expect governments, corporations and these powerful families to act like YOU are not. 

&#x200B;

You want to defeat the "illuminati", help your friends, neighbours. Love your family. Dont do things just because of "money". This is how you beat your "illuminati".

Keep ypur money out of the above groups. Think anout where you spend,  more importantly,  where you spend your time.

Prepping, stockpiling and "arming" yourself makes you no different than these groups you apparently hate. Do you really think your outlook,  values and morality is any better or worse than the " illuminati "? Than why should you succeed in a doomsday or Day zero event? 

Fear, envy and greed. Thats what summarizes your average " illuminati " researcher.  They are afraid,  skeptical by nature types, they also covet the power of others and are quite often portraying the exact values they apparently " despise " in the Illuminati. 

You dont realize is this:

The Illuminati does not exist,  but you do. 

Its the preppers and " Illuminati " nuts you need to watch out for. They only care about themselves.  Its not like they have a plan to save their hometown. 

No, its always,  how could have Beef Jerky in Illuminati takeover,  better buy a dehydrator.  Oh, I better buy 3 handguns too. Instead of buying seeds, farming tools to " rebuild " society.  The preppers themselves will inevitably and always be that " Local Government " who repress others.

Be careful friends.

Our responsibility
I haven't written a text post in a while, but I want to discuss what I feel we as a community here can achieve. Over time, this sub has moved from posts of triangle graffiti, to posts that hopefully inspire some type of critical reaction by you, our subscribers. 

Whether you agree with the posts, or whether you strongly and wholeheartedly disagree, isn't necessarily the point. The point is that through your interactions and engagement with the material here, it's hoped that you, that we, will grow as people and challenge our assumptions. If the posts here have inspired nothing else than an attitude of defiance in the face of orthodoxy and dogma, I will feel that this subreddit has achieved something good.

However, I feel that we also can take opportunities to ask ourselves what our responsibility as conscious individuals are - our responsibility in our world, in our society, in our civilization, and in our communities. If we challenge what we feel are injustices in our local communities, I believe we can make our lives more meaningful and more impactful. That's not to say that challenge always carries with it antagonism or hostility. It's possible to challenge a prevailing view or an opinion simply by motivating people to think. So, I challenge you, I challenge myself, I challenge us, to think about ways we can challenge dogmatic thinking in others, and hopefully awaken more people to the freedom of critical thought.

George Washington Had Some Strong Convictions About The Illuminati

[oc] The Enduring Oath

The Illuminati are the good guys
Why? I believe the dark web is a collective representation of humanity's dark side. The Illuminati actually suppresses that dark side through governments and everything governments do. Without governments forcing people to be decent, the few truly good people out there would have no chance at a peaceful existence.

It's true that the Illuminati allows and encourages a lot of evil to happen, but I've come to the conclusion that the evil they allow is the least amount necessary to balance everything out.

If you want a more detailed explanation of how this probably works, please watch the following video.

Seriously, people still believe that the illuminati are satanists and/or reptilians from Nibiru and/or the fucking rich elite !?  
Wake up! In all these conspiracy theories there's only ONE real thing:  THE RICH ELITE IS YOUR ENEMY.  
All the rest is their fucking propaganda. You should reverse everything they say.  
So why they say the illuminati are the enemy? It's so obvious it scares me that people don't see through the lie.  
The illuminati are the good guys. this secret society has always existed. they operated behind Illuminism (who would have guessed!?), the french revolution, the american revolution and many other circumstances.  
They've been fighting throughout history to bring about a global revolution and create a world of freedom, truth, reason, understanding, passion, compassion, art, love and sex.

who else believes that there is this one being who is trying to rule all of humanity and the only way it chooses is through our thoughts.

I believe that it has been trying to be a god since ancient of times and trying to make people worship his idea of god. (how in the earth did every human tribe on this planet came up with the concept of god). The being obviously failed as that thought had too many version and not all the people of this planet were following a single God (an idea made by our invisible mind wizard buddy). The current version of his idea for getting all humanity under his control is not named God.. it named the idea 'Money'... very materialistic and something which we believe is completely human made and nothing extraterrestrial or celestial thingy which is too hard to believe or easy to challenge, but something which we are tricked to believe is under our control but governs the whole fuckin planet now.

Quantum Physics And Consciousness: A Mystery Yet To Be Resolved

Regarding my dream last night
Here's a brief description of what I can recall of my dream last night.
 
I just vaguely remember being seated outside some tall office-like building possibly even a government related one and as I was sitting there outside the building there had been a security/police officer type individual seated near to me outside just staring directly at me and as I notice him I could see that he was trying to read me somehow possibly via telepathy and as he had been trying to do so he was in some sort of psychological struggle which was reflected into his physical state with him looking on edge, nervous and frustrated and he seemed to be rocking/pacing up until he finally left.
Another key word I can recall seeing or being mentioned during this dream was 'psyops' or 'psycops' (can't recall exact spelling) which I find interesting as even though I've briefly heard it mentioned throughout the past I've never actually done any extensive research into the subject nor have I had it brought to my attention in recent months so it was random in the sense it had came up in my dream now like that.
But basically what I had taken from the dream was that you may be able to prevent yourself from becoming a vulnerability/target from these lower vibrational government agents if you work on your psychic state and get yourself into a state of being where they are unable to access and/or attack you on a psychic level.

Please Stop
Alright, I have nothing about conspiracy videos, nothing at all. But there's one single thing that bothers me and I think it's time I express my opinion loud and clear. Here goes : FOR FUCK'S SAKE STOP USING THE MUSIC FROM RFAD!!!! Seriously, I know Requiem For A Dream's OST is incredibly good, but I beg, I ask you all, please stop using that song! It's ruining the whole movie for me! That song is supposed to represent the characters' slow decent to madness and their struggle to keep a grip on reality, it's not meant to be used in a video with Facebook being evil! This is pissing me off, because that's, in my opinion, one of the best movie scores in History, if not the single best score. And when I see everyone using this song left and right without giving credit whatsoever in a video of any kind, it really enrages me. I even saw a fucking pasta commercial use this song for fuck's sake! A FUCKING PASTA COMMERCIAL!!! So please, stop using that specific song, or at least GIVE CREDITS to the compositor. (Clint Mansell if you're curious. Thank me later.) Thank you and please, have some respect for masterpieces like Requiem For A Dream.

Julian Assange AMA moved to January 10, 2017 at 9 am EST

What happened to armageddonconspiracy.co.uk ?
Do you remember this website? It was the most thought provoking source on Illuminati. The author(s) were very open minded and knowledgeable. Arguments were something you could discuss upon. One snapshot from the old website is [here.](http://i.imgur.com/YbmK0lEg.png) I searched the web a lot to find this only screenshot! New website at the same address, which is probably hacked and changed to something silly, does not have anything now.

I guess the website is hacked by some government. Anyone has the old website in a .zip file? Would be greatly appreciated.

I mean, look [here](https://www.reddit.com/domain/armageddonconspiracy.co.uk/), people were talking about this website all the time. Now there is nothing left, and nobody said anything. 

Any knowledge? I really liked this website back in time.

Illuminati Quarterly Book Club - The book for the First Quarter of 2017 will be Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche
It has been a while since we have had a book of the month. The initial goal of one book per month may have been too ambitious. Therefore, I would like to try this as a Quarterly, rather than a monthly, endeavor.

For January 2017, I've chose a book that has been a personal favorite of mine since it helped me overcome a deep, deep personal depression. 

The book for the First Quarter of 2017 will be [Thus Spoke Zarathustra](https://chechar.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/zarathustra.pdf) by Friedrich Nietzsche.

I hope that it will serve as a light for you as much as it did for me.

Focus on solutions ~ not problems! What you focus on the longest becomes the strongest. The best way to deal with the challenges you are facing is to look for solutions.
Spend your time being creative, resourceful and get some help. Worry is faith turned inside out...assuming the negative. It wastes your energy and does not solve anything. It paralyzes you, stifles your growth and robs you of your creativity.
Use your imagination to come up with a variety of approaches to move your life forward. Challenge yourself to think beyond that which is commonly accepted. Hold the vision of what you want. Be clear about this and move forward with the feeling and expectation that things are going to work out just fine. You have GREATNESS within you!!

What really grinds my gears‚Ä¶
Is the lack of control humans have and how most of us are happy enough to settle for the illusion of control. It‚Äôs how humans never question authority by fight tooth and nail to dismember their peers‚Äô ideas. Is how we are in a giant machine called economy and within this machine are various parts just like in our cars, And similar to our cars there‚Äôs a point where nothing works and we‚Äôll be put in a scrap yard and forgotten. Some parts function so well however that they are credited with recognition but not before they have been replaced. I hate the way I have to ask for permission to go to the toilet, I hate the way I HAVE to trade in whatever precious little time I have on this planet for a career. A career that will benefit others more than it‚Äôll benefit me. I hate the way humans have agreed to be bought by a piece of paper with no value other than that we place on it, I hate that we agree to let someone manage all this money, I hate the way we are punished for breaking the routine the system placed on us, I hate the way I am told what is good and not good for me by people who are doing what they are telling me not to do, I hate factthat this information only exists on this page and in my brain, I hate factthat people with power wish they had power so they can ‚Äúbring some change‚Äù but get corrupted by the power they wish for. I hate the way a piece of abstract painting could cost an upwards of 50million whereas a book with a thousand words couldn‚Äôt sell for more than ¬£10, I hate the way we pretend death is a good thing just the same way we pretend money is worth our time when in reality we know that money is just a piece of paper and death is the last thing we want. I hate factthat religions have the most influence of the masses and yet in hindsight religion has done more damage than good, I hate the saying ‚ÄúGod works in mysterious ways‚Äù, I hate thinking that God is a coward for not showing himself to us, I hate factthat we out of all the billions of species ‚Äúare special‚Äù I hate the way we destroy everything we touch even with the purest of intentions, I hate factthat once a human has interfered nothing will be the same, I hate never being satisfied, I hate society, I hate how we think not doing anything is the same as being against, I hate factthat most of us see ourselves as spectators of life without realising that we are the spectacle, I hate how much power we give to those who promise to give us what we want but instead they use it to gain what they want, I hate how this has happened over and over but yet we still trust that somethings going to change, I hate how each and every one of us want change but don‚Äôt want to work for it, I hate factthat we are ruining the world not only for us but for all the other inhabitants as well, I hate factthat humans will be forgotten soon and all the pain and suffering we have been through would‚Äôve been for nothing, I hate difference; so does every other human on earth and that is why we have wars, racists and so many other pointless deaths, I hate how quickly we forget, I hate how we hate to be reminded of the truth, I hate that we need to be reminded of all this, I hate that it took me 18 years to realise the rules we play by are rigged, I hate growing up, not growing old. I hate how no matter how bad people are they will always have a following, I hate factthat this day a hundred years from now will mean nothing. I hate the feeling of being watched from the moment I step outside of my door I hate knowing that we have the power to stop this but are too afraid to exercise it because we know it will work and that scares us. I hate the way we say ‚Äúwe need a leader‚Äù because although they can bring us a few steps forward it‚Äôs easier to chop of one leg than 2. I hate factI‚Äôm the biggest hypocrite for posting this and hoping someone to have the courage that I don‚Äôt, I hate living in fear, I‚Äôm afraid of everything but death, I fear I will be lost in history I fear I am the background but then again would here be a fore ground without a background? I fear that all the good things I‚Äôve grown to like and love won‚Äôt be there in the near future, I fear the reliance we put upon machines, I fear technological and industrial progression will overtake human progression but most of all I fear I will live long enough to realise I am the villain I have been running away all this time and be contempt with it. 
This is a very interesting sub...
First off, supposedly this subreddit started as a kind of joke where people would meme post "illuminarty confirmed" tier images and youtube videos. Then, as I have seen looking at previous posts, it seems to have evolved into a serious discussion (with quite deep posts) of the path to illumination and such stuff. But then in the past few months it was completely taken over by a user named /u/ub3rm3nsch who posts relatively frequently. You seem to post interesting things ub3rm3nsch, keep at it. It's peculiar, when reading older posts here, that you simultaneously have reformed memesters next to transcendence seekers next to people who believe the Illuminati are devil worshipers next to people who believe they are just a secret society trying their best; all of whom are posting together in some kind of strange harmony. Furthermore, the sub shows signs of being very mature: it has a well thought out and consistent design, it has a well made custom icon (instead of the default reddit guy), ten(!) moderators, a well thought out description in the sidebar... and yet there are currently less than 10 people viewing the sub. Even /r/collapse, which I view quiet often, and which doesn't have a well developed design or icon, currently has 60+ viewers.

I am very intrigued with the idea of secret societies and have been doing light research on a few of them recently. Just today I found the "official illuminati" website illuminatiofficial.org and some tertiary sites like illuminati.am. Of course, why would a secret society have a public site where people could request membership, especially when that secret society has historically been invite only? Well these websites seem remarkably legitimate: they don't ask for money, have a deep and significant message, and are of a high quality. But again - the Illuminati is suppose to have dissolved or lost its power hundreds of years ago. Flip the coin once again and, well, it is a secret society: their existence status isn't necessarily a conspicuous thing.

I suppose the implication here is that this reddit was redeveloped by the Illuminati itself and the website I talked about above was created by them all in an effort to detract from the illuminarty memers. I just really don't know.

On a larger scale, well, how can I possibly trust an organization who I don't know even exists or not? I trust enlightenment, but enlightenment is many things to many people (or dare I say... entities :((  ). One infographic on the illuminatiofficial website claimed that they - The Illuminati - have been directly influencing civilization since the first human governments. That is a pretty extreme and strange claim considering that The Illuminati was created in the 17th century.

Illuminati Monthly Book Club! The book for January 2016 will be The Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin
As you know, last month we launched a book club for users of /r/illuminati, choosing [Pedagogy of the Oppressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed) by Paulo Freire. That post is still available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/illuminati/comments/3v0uk4/announcing_illuminati_monthly_book_club_the_book/).

With the start of 2016, we would like to continue expanding on this tradition with the hope that even more users decide to participate in our Book Club and expose themselves to new and interesting ideas.

For the month of January, we've chosen a classic in political philosophy - The Dispossessed, by Ursula K. Le Guin. You can access the book for free [here](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ursula-k-le-guin-the-dispossessed) in html format, and pdf versions are also available for download on the same page.

Interested users, please feel free to discuss this book on this thread.

Announcing: Illuminati Monthly Book Club! The book for December will be Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire.
Greetings everyone,

We on the mod team have decided to launch an Illuminati Book Club on this sub for those interested. 

For the first month (December), I've decided just to select the book, but I think it's a good one. I've chosen [Pedagogy of the Oppressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed) by Paulo Freire. It's an absolutely amazing book that is designed to critically analyze institutional power dynamics. 

You can download a FREE pdf copy in English [here](https://libcom.org/files/FreirePedagogyoftheOppressed.pdf) or you can access a FREE html version [here](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iFFCCphSjLwJ:https://libcom.org/files/FreirePedagogyoftheOppressed.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk).

Interested users, please feel free to discuss this book on this thread. 

For the next months, we would love to have the Books chosen by you - the users. Therefore, prior to the 1st of each month, we will solicit ideas from the user-base, and we can make a selection based on voting. It would be very helpful if the book is available online for free - or at the very least at a reasonable price.

Welcome to /r/freemasonry - Interested in Joining Freemasonry? Ask your questions here!
**How can I become a Freemason?**

First of all, welcome to [r/freemasonry](https://www.reddit.com/r/freemasonry/)! This is a weekly thread for you to ask questions. Being one of the largest online communities on the topic of Freemasonry, we hope that you won't find difficulty getting information you need to decide if you would like to join your local lodge.

General Information:

1. Requirements for membership vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally if you're a man 21 or over (18 or 19 in some states), believe in a Supreme Being, are of good character and reputation, and ask to join, you're eligible.
2. To get started, email or call a local lodge. They would love to hear from you, every lodge welcomes new candidates. They'll set up a meeting to get to know you a bit (we're careful about who we admit as members). Also to tell you a bit about the fraternity, the lodge, etc.
3. To find your local lodges, first, find the Grand Lodge website for your state, province, or country. This is a good resource for the US: bessel.org, or just use Google. They should have a way to find out what lodges meet near you. Then check out your local lodge's websites. If you have a choice of lodges, try to pick one that meets on a weeknight that would be convenient for you, and that appears to be active.
4. Nothing happens quickly in Freemasonry, so it might take awhile to hear back from a lodge after you make contact. Every step takes quite a bit of time.

Have something you want to ask?

From a Mason‚Äôs perspective, why is Masonry banned from the Catholic Church?
As a Catholic I‚Äôve heard what the Church says and wanna know what you think
I finally decided I'm going to look for another lodge. Tired of it being treated as a clubhouse. If you ever left your lodge for another what was your reason(s)?
I just got tired of being treated like crap. The small elder group didn't take things serious anymore. One always complained that we did openings and closings and rituals based on the monitor and ritual book put out by Grand Lodge. Everytime he would disagree with how WM did it he would specifically say "I bet you got that from the book". 

My best friend joined. His mom joined Eastern Star. They wanted to do a fundraiser at one point. They wanted to cook a big meal have people come eat. Offered to do it all themselves. They told them they didn't want to deal with it. Both of them trained chefs btw. Treated him so bad he quit masonry completely this past December after I believe 5 years. There is a lot I could say but won't because I really don't feel like typing all of it. 

Now I have to find another lodge and I don't believe any around me offer a day they meet that keeps my drive time at a reasonable amount to get my child picked up and in bed for school the next day.
Colors associated with the Entered Apprentice degree.
I want to wear a tie and shirt that ties into the entered apprentice degree. I have most color combinations. Any suggestions?

Edit: when I asked, (prior to posting this, originally) they said ‚Äúwear comfortable clothing, but if you want to dress formally, you can do that too, (they know I like to), really, just wear whatever you want‚Äù was their response.
What you ate before your initiation day?
Hello! I'm excited because my initiation will be the 18th, some of the Lodge's Master has recommended that we don't eat red meat, no alcohol and light eating for at least 3 days prior.

So, masons from reddit, what was that experience for you and what was your menu. Thanks in advance :D
A mm degree
Attention Ohio and Pa. Masons, there will be a mm degree next Thursday the 23rd at Allen #276 Columbiana, Ohio. This is in northeast  Ohio 24th district.

Tips for Leading Lodge Discussions
Hello again brethren. I am the LEO of my lodge this year and i have been wanting to include lodge discussions in my education programs for a while. I have never led a discussion in lodge though and don't really know how to go about it. I fear that I may have a hard time soliciting participation and there will be a lot of uncomfortable silence.

Have any other LEO's or brothers utilized open discussions as education programs? How did it go? What tips or advice can you provide? My lodge is filled with brilliant men and I'd like to hear them express their thoughts more.

apparently the masons symbol os a religious symbol
So I went to a job interview the other day and they said that the dress code is casual so I asked about self expression, and the employer said that self expression through how you dress is allowed to an extent, but no religious symbols. I asked about my masonry and DeMolay pins tjay I have and if I could wear those on my apron. Employer said no because that's a religious symbol. What are your thoughts on this? Immediately after that I told the employer that I wasn't interested in the job bc of various reasons, that included.
Do I Change Blue Lodges

Unusual Rejection
Hey guys I was recently rejected and am looking for some advice. Excuse my lengthy discourse, but I dont want to give up on my masonic journey. I'm willing to take constructive criticism and really want to know what I can do to make sure I'm a more suitable candidate. I understand I had some things in my past that would cause anybody to want to look a little deeper into my character so I wasnt upset with that. Let me give the backstory:

Im only 27 years old. I grew up really hard. My mother was an addict and introduced me to drugs at a young age, I never met my father, molested by uncle, grandpa doesnt talk to me but does everything for Uncle(guess its my fault fault his son molested me)Unfortuantely, I did end up with an addiction issue. At the age of 14, while homeless with my mother, I was removed from my mother and placed in foster care. I struggled with addiction as a teen and when I was released from foster care I struggled with homelessness as well. Unfortunately, I did end up with a drug charge and a few minor midemeanors. I spent a couple years on the streets. While at a shelter( probably 19 or 20 years old at the tine) I tried petitioning at a lodge and never obtained sponsorship, as they felt I wasnt honest about my criminal though I felt I was. The secretary called me and said "My advice: find another lodge." I acceppetd and understood maybe it wasnt a good time. Anyway, I ended up getting my girlfriend pregnant and it was the kick in the posterior I needed to change my life. At about 21 I really started to look at my life and realized I needed to be a man. I got stable employment, got off the drugs, got a house, and now my wife stays at home and I take care of 4 children. Have for many years just gone up. Now to my recent petition:

Around October 2022 I petitioned at a different lodge that is in the town I now live in. I have some concerns that my petition was not handled properly and I got a lot of very conflicting information about it from different brothers handling my petition. I made sure to disclose that my entire criminal history, and made note that Im not a felon. Due to the format ony new petition I also disclosed that I tried petitioning at another lodge at one point, but that I did not pursue the petition. Because I was told to find another lodge, I never sought a second sponser from prior petition, thus I saw fit to say on new petition I never pursued the prior petition. Moving on: I wrote an in depth letter explaining the circumstances of my criminal charges and that I grew up hard, but really turned my life around, and that I hope overcoming all these issues many people never shows my strength if character, rather than a reason to look down on me. The lodge decided they wanted to get 2 more sponsors, on top of my original 2. No problem. I'd do what it takes. Well, they just kindof ghosted me for a month or two. No communication at all. Then I got a call one Saturday afternoon fron my 4th sponsor( Past Grandmaster of my state BTW) and he said "Hey were voting on your petition tonight. Meet me at the lodge." I came in, he goes "Hey just gotta say I talked to you. Anyway sounds like youve had a hard life. You were really honst. I advise you not to talk about that too much when you get in. Anyway, we'll get your petition done and schedule your for initiation." I asked about why I never met the investigation committee, and he said theyd already been out. Odd.. I though "Oh well, great!." 

Never heard anything. So I went down to the breakfast thismorning that they have every month, already assuming petition was rejected. I spoke with the secretary( my first sponsor), and he said that what shot me in the foot was that I didnt disclose that I was rejected at another lodge. He said I was very honest about my record, and that wasnt the issue. Some of the brothers felt I had omitted information by not revealing that I was rejected at another lodge. I explained that I never meant to deceive at all, and that I did not realize that not obtaining sponsorship was considered being rejected at another lodge, but at this point I now am being seen as having ommitted information on my petition twice. Such a small misunderstanding in my eyes, and Im surprised I never got the chance to really have that explained to me. His advice was to just wait a couple years and try again. I asked him if Im welcome to apply at this lodge again after a couple years and he said sure. I asked why I never met with the investigation committee, and he said it never got to that point(conflicting with what my orher sponsor said.) But the bottom line: None of the sponsors really took the time to get to know me. They never even took money with my petition. The whole thing just seemed kind of weird. Any advice would be helpful. I want to make sure I do everything to be a worthy candidate, and am also curious to know if anybody thinks this lodge mightnl have handled my petition improperly. Again, the communication was terrible, and I got mixed information from just about everybody. Im really surprised they didnt try to get to know me or anything. Just took the petition and voted on it.

Anyone ever bought a custom apron?
Let me preface this by saying I am mainly interested so I can get one that fits more comfortably. Design is purely secondary for me. 

I am going to my first grand lodge soon and will be getting a custom apron while there. I was thinking of getting a simple one that has a couple of symbols for the 1st degree lecture that mean a lot to me. What design have you brothers gotten on any you‚Äôve purchased?

When to Ask For a Petition?
So I‚Äôve met with a couple of brothers from a local lodge, and I really seem to get along with them. I went to a post-degree dinner a few weeks ago at the lodge and got to meet more of the lodge members. I‚Äôm planning on getting together with them next week as well. I‚Äôm pretty certain I want to join this lodge, but I understand that I will not be asked to join. How soon is ‚Äútoo soon‚Äù when asking for a petition/signatures? Should I send an email asking to meet up to ask in person, or take them aside during an event to ask instead? I just want to do this right.

Thank you! üôÇ

Question about visiting lodges.
Hi all, 

I‚Äôve recently submitted my interest at my local lodge to join (uk lodge) when I was in the us I noticed a lodge in New York. Once I become a member does it mean you can freely visit any lodge? Or is it specific? There is loads to learn and find out. 

Thank you all in advance.
Posting Pictures of Challenge Coin
This one came with a story. In Ohio, there was a man named Chad Simpson, who was Director of Programs for Grand Lodge for many years. He was working with the 'Other Ohio Chad' on this year's conference when he unexpectedly passed about a year ago. Chad's idea behind this coin was to make it a true challenge coin-in order to earn this coin, you had to give it away. You received this coin because you were someone who 'had a seat at the table' in Masonic Education; so, to earn it, you needed to give it to someone who you thought should also have a seat at the table. You'd get your coin back from them, at the conference. Looking forward to earning my coin in Canton.

Taking jacket off at dinner
Hi all,

I was recently kindly informed by our WM not to take my jacket off at dinner. I asked him, well why didn't you say anything at lodge!, jokingly. He did tell me, thankfully, right before a dinner of approx. 90 people.

Anyway, now I know. But I definitely didn't know this was a thing. I would consider myself fairly observant, and I simply don't know why I didn't notice anybody else taking off their jackets when eating after lodge meetings!

I am a Fellowcraft and just wanted to share this humbling story.

I have a dream
I have a dream of one day publishing my collection of poems. They're personal stories with an esoteric undertone describing my descent into "Hell" as I struggled with addiction. I eventually want to write 2 more describing living in Hell, then ascending out of it. 

Are there any Masonic publishers or agents who I could send a manuscript too that could help a Brother achieve his dreams?

unsure what to do with inherited freemasonry items (UK)
My grandfather recently passed away, and I was given all his memorabilia, books, jewellery etc. I am, despite all the stories he told us, very uneducated in freemasonry and I have no clue what everything is. The problem is I am not sure what to do with it all and I am getting conflicting opinions. 

My father suggested to keep it, other family members say sell it, and others say return it. When he was alive, he was incredibly protective of it, and I am unsure as to whether I should keep it. 

Am I allowed to keep it or sell it, or should all his items be returned to someone, and if so who? I am not sure who to ask this to, as my grandfather was the only person I knew who was a member.
In San Jose please send your prayers.

Once again, I'm sorry if this is a weird or dumb question, but I'm still very interested in becoming a Freemason and I wanted to know the actual Freemason's thoughts on if I purchased a ring for the day that I become a master mason even if I'm currently not one.

Edit: I would NOT be buying this to wear immediately, ONLY once I became a master mason!

But I have been to NC lodge where it was polo and kakis. Please state your Country, state/ province when replying.
Writing About Freemasonry
The last day of this month will mark the two year anniversary of my Masonic newsletter and website.  In those two years I've worked on it every day, and published something new many more days than not.

Have you ever wondered what it might be like to create and publish such a thing?  Do you wonder if anyone would end up reading it?

I assume that some here have, because in those two years I've seen quite a few started by Freemasons in the US and around the world.  Most don't end up really getting up of the ground, some do but fairly quickly lose momentum.  A very small number remain over a longer haul.  It is, honestly, a tremendous amount of work, and takes up a great deal of time.

But, I have found it to be remarkably rewarding, and I know that it makes a difference.

If you have considered doing something like this, I've created a fairly detailed report on my progress over these past two years.  You might find this report about my experience doing this valuable or interesting.

The short story is that I'm looking forward to continuing publishing for the next two years and beyond, the longer story is detailed in the report below:

I‚Äôve always wondered why many religious people think Freemasons are Satan worshippers or something to that degree. Why do you think they believe in that?

Common gavels for the WM, SW, and JW
My lodges gavels were starting to come apart so I made some new one for them.
So, I tried asking ChatGPT about the "Masonic Conspiracies"
Because we get the regular conspiracy  theorists nosing around, I wondered how ChatOpenAI would respond to a few simple questions. 

Here's how it responded:


>>are freemasons a secret society

>The Freemasons are often considered a secret society because of their use of symbols, signs, and codes that are only known to members. They also have a ritualistic initiation process that is not disclosed to the public. However, the organization itself is not completely secretive and many of its principles and activities are known to the public. The Freemasons themselves consider themselves a fraternal organization rather than a secret society, and their focus is on charitable work and moral development, not on keeping their activities hidden from the public.

>>do freemasons worship demons?

>No, Freemasons do not worship demons. The Freemason organization is based on principles of morality, charity, and brotherhood, and they do not have any connection to devil worship or any other form of demonic worship. The use of symbols and rituals in Freemasonry has been the subject of much speculation and misinformation, but the organization itself is not associated with any form of evil or devil worship. In fact, the values and beliefs of the Freemasons are centered around positive principles such as integrity, charity, and fairness, and they have a long history of charitable work and community service.

>>do freemasons do favors for each other?

>Freemasons may provide support and assistance to one another, as is common among many fraternal organizations. The principles of brotherhood and charity are central to the Freemason organization, and members are encouraged to help one another in times of need. However, it is important to note that the support provided by Freemasons to each other is not based on a quid pro quo arrangement or a guarantee of favors. Instead, it is based on the idea of mutual support and the belief that helping one another is part of the obligations of brotherhood.

>It is also worth noting that the Freemasons do not engage in any illegal or unethical activities, and they do not use their membership for personal gain or to further their own interests. The organization is based on principles of morality, fairness, and integrity, and members are expected to conduct themselves accordingly.

Pike inscribed Grand Constitutions on eBay
I want to share this link in case anyone is interested in this item.

It appears to be a copy of the Grand Constitutions of Freemasonry published in 1872, inscribed and signed by Albert Pike.

I have no idea if it's authentic or whether it's worth $3,500 USD.

https://www.ebay.com/itm/293777639186?hash=item4466830712:g:E2QAAOSwbC9fg10H&amdata=enc%3AAQAHAAAA8HzwfsVE2JYynWsyoL50lfGlTjbcXsoaeLl7J1yvGwamXIAvThmR26n9l4VgMgbjwdv07As1e0KUvWx1n5we%2BNG8%2FoTGWKaQ3vowZA194yBEvkoPfWf%2F5pqXFQLOO59i0Q%2FiYwHl77UBCaE8g7eoqV6rJGJUPe27IY5OQC8QQ9Qo8LFiuKuUUFOB5IXsvzOLHS%2BtDyEkXGp%2F5hSOT9qsH141MiTEDkOW0Wru1yFmzEHbj%2BXOqHTMNI%2FNEl81dgqOafR4gncDODyOFPPYB8xAF1uA3vlBNCP5KYSqf0g7PERFJFX7JMXBvQyxgNiPCTiQxA%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABFBM8tbQi8dh
Going on into the chairs
I have been approached about going into the chairs for the next cycle. I would be starting from the beginning as Jr Steward (as it should be in my opinion) but I have some concerns. 

My youngest will be going in the 8th grade and my wife is worried about how it could affect me and my personal life due to the amount of work I‚Äôll need to learn. Of course this also concerns me, as I did struggle with returns/catechisms (some people have different verbiage) due to job profession (which will be changing) and the activities my kids are in. Now some of these will fade as time goes, but nonetheless I always tend to put my family first and my lodge work second. 

Any thoughts or advice for this? I have spoken to the SW and he assured me that there is latitude given, especially at the lower levels. I guess I am concerned about JD and further on, especially since it is standard that you are always practicing for the next chair in certain degrees. I‚Äôd also like to add that by the time I make it to that chair, we‚Äôll have our GM in regular attendance as he is a member of our lodge so that makes my concerns that much greater.
Freemasonry in India?
Does anybody know any Jain members or even for those in the states do y‚Äôall know anything about the practice in India or if any minority religions are represented?
So this happened tonight.
Tonight I was honored by my lodge with the Hiram Award. I was quite speechless. For a first time Worshipful Master, it‚Äôs truly an honor. I‚Äôm glad my brothers appreciate the work I‚Äôve been doing. I‚Äôll always cherish it.
Not a mason? But I have a question.
Do masons put what they‚Äôve learned and or gathered from being a Mason into workplaces and daily interactions with others? My boss is a Mason, he‚Äôs been one for twenty years now. He is pretty strict, and he seems to value keeping your word and high integrity amongst all things. Although this is a typical managing style, he is definitely ‚Äúharsh‚Äù, at least on me (in a sense), and in all honesty it‚Äôs not really a bad experience, it does helps you learn I suppose. Is this just the mason way? He isn‚Äôt a bad boss by any means but probably the most interesting and unique I‚Äôve encountered out of all my bosses so far. Which is why I asked the question, his uniqueness is just really intriguing to me, and knowing he‚Äôs a mason makes me wonder more.

Question on dissatisfaction in Lodge
Hello. I‚Äôve been a mason for quite a while now and attended lodge in multiple jurisdictions including being an officer in two. I‚Äôm currently a Warden but I‚Äôm experiencing some pretty significant dissatisfaction with my current lodge and I‚Äôm not sure what to do about it. Not to get too personal but my current lodge has a not insignificant amount of political opinion being thrown around (not exactly in lodge but definitely before and after) as well as a metric shit ton of ego and just general obtuseness. It‚Äôs to a point that I really don‚Äôt even want to go but as a warden I have responsibilities. Were it not for my position in lodge I‚Äôd probably just walk away. Additionally there‚Äôs a decent amount incest with the surrounding lodges in that I‚Äôm 100% guaranteed to run into some people that are really causing me problems so another local lodge isn‚Äôt really an option. That said has anyone had an experience like that and if so how did you deal with it? Also I don‚Äôt know if any former members are here but if why did you leave and what could‚Äôve been done for you to stay?
Opinions/advice
Hey everyone! I have been a Master Mason for about 12 years. I recently moved to a new state and petitioned for dual membership with the lodge closest to me. It is what I would consider a typical small town lodge. Low numbers. Mostly older gentlemen. I have been a few times when they didn‚Äôt have the appropriate numbers to proceed with business. Another brother was also petitioning for dual membership. His home lodge is in this state and he is a Past Master. He recently moved and this lodge is closer. He seemed fine to me. He was always willing to assist with any work that was going on. Very knowledgeable. Good attitude. Not the argumentative ‚Äúknow it all‚Äù type. The investigative committee returned favorable results. Despite all of this, he was blackballed the other night (Single). I know and understand the reasoning of the secrecy of the ballot but this one just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially given factthat it was for dual membership and not a new candidate. If this fella was of good standing at his current lodge, has been sitting in and assisting this lodge, and received a favorable committee investigation, I just don‚Äôt see someone blackballing him as very brotherly. Afterward the WM even said ‚ÄúI hope you still come and visit because we sure need the help.‚Äù I just feel like as small as this lodge is any issues probably could have been discussed before it got this far. It makes me question my membership petition and whether I really want to affiliate with this lodge. Am I being unreasonable?

Royal Arch
I took the Royal Arch degrees last weekend.  It was a one day festival where all 4 degrees were conferred in one day to about 40 of us.  Is this how YR degrees are usually conferred or are these degrees usually conferred one degree at a time other than when offered in a one day festival format say once a year? I found the one day festival to be absent of the close personal connection and experience of my blue lodge degrees.  What is your YR degree experience?

Squaring Masonry & The Length of One's Cabletow
Hi Brothers,

This is my first post, and I am looking for some brotherly advice or encouragement regarding my journey in Masonry. I've been a Mason for 12 years and early in my Masonic life, I was very active in the Fraternity, serving as Worshipful Master of my Lodge and Venerable Master in my Scottish Rite Valley. I absolutely love our Craft and can't begin to describe how much Freemasonry has enriched my life and personal development, not to mention the lifelong friendships I've formed with brothers both locally and abroad.

Since 2020, however, I've had a difficult time balancing Masonry with my personal time commitments, to the point that I rarely attend my Blue Lodge. This is not out of lack of appreciation or desire to participate, but my cable tow is stretched thin. Changes in my life include getting married, taking on a job that requires a lot of out of state travel, and ongoing personal struggles with "burn out" due to juggling two simultaneous job roles, travel, and striving to be attentive to my marriage. Because our Lodge meetings take place later in the evening, I struggle to find the energy to attend even when I am available. My personal circumstances are now dramatically different than they were when I joined in my late 20s, and to be frank, I don't think I would have been able to join the Fraternity or give it the time commitment it deserves had I considered petitioning at this stage in my life. However, I feel badly and worry I am not doing my part to support the Fraternity.

I'm just curious how other Brothers deal with work/life/Lodge time balances and whether I should be a bit more open in sharing some of my personal challenges with the Lodge. I don't want to come across as a whiner or excuse maker, but I also don't want the brothers to think I've lost interest or turned my back on them after wrapping up my year in the East.

Any brotherly counsel would be appreciated. Thank you.
Fleur de lis in masonry
I've read in some places that it has some relation with masonry, although it doesn't mention any meaning or symbolism. Does anyone know something about it?
Our secretary is our DDGM this year so of course I had to snag the new coin!

Masonic Swag Question
I know the answer is that it is jurisdictional; but I have a question about token and swag for GL Officers. 

In my USA jurisdiction, we have yearly GM pins. We don‚Äôt buy them, they just are. Some will sell ties or other items to support their specific charity. District Deputy Grand Masters, District Education Officers, and District Advisors typically have business cards but not their own pin, coin, etc.; just isn‚Äôt the custom. Sometimes Districts have a yearly pin to support the District, but that varies by District. 

I‚Äôm hearing that is the custom in other jurisdictions, that District-level officers are asked to sell GM swag to sponsor the GM and GL; that it is customary for District-level officers to have their own pin, challenge coin, etc. It could easily be the case that you feel obligated to buy a sh*t-ton of swag over the course of the year. Just wondering what is customary in your neck of the woods.
I was raised to the sublime degree last night.
And what a turnout. I was taken aback upon arriving at lodge.  If I remember correctly, we had 35 brothers attend from a total of 15 lodges across the state, 3 of the brethren being from the Grand Line. 
While I would love to bask about the beauty of the degree, this token of an action was just as beautiful to me respectively.

Help with an unfamiliar symbol
One of our Brothers gave an educational presentation on the Working Tools this evening. He brought in his father‚Äôs presentation trowel (and some other paraphernalia he‚Äôd been given on a recent visit ‚Äúhome‚Äù), as the Trowel is a common working tool in the Preston-Webb work, which contrasts with our Skirret-Pencil-Compasses trio in the MM. We were unsure of the [symbol in the top left](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/608108596/masonic-trowel-for-freemasons-gold-or?click_key=199d73bfd0cb07ed8ed3f9cf12c39e366223f183%3A608108596&click_sum=0f36768a&ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=masonic+trowel&ref=sr_gallery-1-2&frs=1&col=1), opposite the apron, and while Google turned up the linked image, it did not give us a detailed description. Is it some kind of basket? He thought maybe a lantern? Thinking back to what I know of the P-W lectures I thought maybe a stylized beehive, or a weird pot of incense?

Can someone enlighten us? If anyone is concerned about violating their obligations, I‚Äôm more interested in simply identifying the symbol than enquiring as to the meaning behind it, as I just can‚Äôt match up the imagery with anything familiar.

Any female freemasons on here?
Hi everyone,

I know most people in this sub are American and thus predominantly male, so you consider freemasonry a male-only thing and would call organisations like the Order of the Eastern Star a sort of alternative to freemasonry for women.

However, I live in a country where the official main lodge (don't know whether that's the correct English term, I mean THE lodge in the country all other lodges are somehow part of and look up to) has accepted female-only lodges as 100% equal to the traditional male-only lodges (and there are also mixed lodges).

I would like to ask whether anyone on here is part of a female-only or mixed lodge? (and really a freemason-lodge, not the Order of the Eastern Star). I would love to ask a few questions :)

(I am not entirely sure how some people on this sub think about female freemasonry and I hope it does not offend anyone. I know it used to be 100% male and is still the case in many countries and I don't think that's old-fashioned, discriminating against women or the like - I just happen to live in a country where women are also accepted. but this is not supposed to be a feminist post or the like)

To believe or not to believe
I've been wanting to join freemasonry for a long time, but one of the fundamental rules have stopped me from putting my name in the hat.

I was born into a Christian home but was never a religious person. In later years all belief in the Abrahamic faiths disappeared. I know there must be something out there but I don't know what it is.

Does this exclude me from joining?

I saw a few videos on Anton LaVey who was an atheistic satanist. Who was also a Mason.

How is this rule enforced?

Any help on this will be greatly appreciated.

Using FM as an avenue for worship.
So I have been having this issue where I don't have a church that I regularly go to. I wasn't raised in a religious household. I consider myself to be a Christian in the protestant aspect, but nothing deeper than that. I've been trying to find a local church that I can connect with, but haven't had much luck. I have been using FM as an avenue for that religious connection. I know it's not a religion, nor is it a replacement. I'm a PM and I just feel the most comfortable in a lodge, and for me, it's like going to church. I have learned more about the Bible in lodge than I had from any sermon. 

I guess what I'm getting at is, is there a denomination that correlates well with FM? It's just been difficult to find a church that I can tolerate. I don't want to join a church heavily involved in politics, I don't want them to call me 6 days a week, and I don't want to sing. I just want to show up Sunday, listen to a sermon, toss some money into a bin, and be on my way after an hour, maybe 2. 

I'm not sure what I'm looking for exists.
Any thoughts?

EDIT: Thank you all for the advice and considerations. I'll have to look into them and go from there.
How to reach out to masons in other states to be paid witnesess
I've been a Mason for 3 years. I have a mobile signing agency and i have a client where the notaries need to bring witnesses for the signings.  A lot of times it difficult for them to find friends to bring.  I never have that problem locally because of the members of the lodge. 

To be clear, the signings are for people that have made a trust or will and we pay $20 for a witness. 

I'd like to be able to offer this to brothers and family members.  Anyone over the age of 18 can do it.  I just don't know how i would go about reaching out to people through the lodges.  Would i be able to put posts here for areas that that i need someone?  Would i need to get a contact and a lodge in that area?  And how would i get in contact with someone in that area?

Any assistance or guidance would be very helpful. 

Thank you.

Lodge Activity Suggestions
It is no secret that a lot of Masonic blue lodges are suffering a decline in active membership. A lot of members have become card holders and are no longer actively attending blue lodge for either stated meetings or other meetings due them simply not being appealing to the brethren.

With work and daily family life adding stress onto brothers shoulders, as well as the lingering health concerns from the pandemic, it is hard to get the brethren interested in giving up what little free time they have left to relax in favor of attending an unappealing monthly stated meeting or other meeting.

A lot of brethren are also abandoning their blue lodges in favor of the more appealing appendant bodies such as the Scottish Rite, York Rite, Shriners, etc. I am looking for suggestions from other blue lodges on what sort of appealing Lodge activities could be implemented to help get members more interested in returning to blue lodge? 

There is no such thing as a stupid suggestion, so don‚Äôt be afraid to throw your ideas out there. I‚Äôm just trying to brainstorm some ideas that I can present for consideration by my lodge officers.

Question about Petitioning
Hello all,

I am new to posting on Reddit so bare with me. I am highly interested in become a Freemason as from the outside I see all the good work Freemasons do in the community and have a brotherly connection with one another. I petitioned for a PHA lodge and went through the investigation committee part and am waiting to here back. Prior to that I had reached out to a FA & AM Lodge and they got back to me. There was quite a bit of delay in communication as I have been patiently waiting. Since I have petitioned the PHA Lodge and went through the investigation committee am I allowed to visit the FA & AM Lodge or does the PHA lodge hold jurisdiction over me? Thank you for your help.

Fakers and Imposters
I know this is Reddit, and there's really no way of weeding out people who say they are masons who really aren't, but I've had some chats and encounters with people on here that are rude and unnecessary. I'm hoping brothers in the UK and other countries aren't that abrasive to masons from the USA. I'll be the first to admit that I'm embarrassed by my political leaders, but keep in mind that all Americans aren't like that. I read my Bible everyday, try my best to walk the walk, and represent my lodge wherever I go. For those that might hold bad feelings towards us, please remember brothers, that we all do our labors under the grand design of the GAOTU. Hopefully, one day I will hear the words, "Well done thou good and faithful servant." Peace be with you, gentlemen.
Went through 6 Degrees in York Rite yesterday, and I am excited to keep going.
I petitioned to join the York Rite a few weeks ago and was accepted rather quickly. I was told by my mentor in Blue Lodge that it will be a festival, which I did not know what that meant. I spent several hours with 22 other Brothers from my area going through the Chapter and Council and had my grandfather with me (he's been a YR Mason for nearly a decade). Had a great breakfast and lunch, and no, not pancakes or spaghetti for change. This followed up with watching and participating in the degrees. I loved how they made it more memorable for every single one of us, if it wasn't for how bad my feet hurt I could've imagined being at the locations in the degrees.

In two weeks I go through the Commandery, and I am excited to see what comes there. I plan to go to as many meetings as possible, as this has caught my attention so much more.

A few questions for joining
Greatings freemasons,
I am only a teenager, 16 to be exact, but I want to know more, i have read on a Freemasonry website that I need to be 18 to join, and I'm fine to wait. In the time that I wait, I can learn more about life, and have a better understanding of it, with more knowledge, I can do more for future brothers.
My great grandfather was a Freemason, sadly I do not know much about him, I know he wasn't high, but I still find it interesting.
I read that you have to believe in a higher being, but the thing is I believe in the possibility of all gods existing, Afterall, what proof is there that any are not real, that being said, I do have deeper connections to Nordic and Celtic religion(religion is the best way to describe without going into detail I guess). I have a well of knowledge, especially of some more different topics, I love to hear stories and perspectives from a load of different people over many cultures, after all, without knowledge of someone from a different background, how am I supposed to know the reality of world around me, I'm not even sure I understand what I'm saying, but I guess the easiest question to ask is, how do I know if this is part of my path.
Anyone with knowledge of how I can find out more about my great grandfather or anyone with greater knowledge that can help me understand "must affirm your belief in a Supreme Being.", or anyone able to help me decide if Freemasonry is part of my path, I'm always ready to listen, thank you for your time, may good fortune be on your side, blessed be
Regalia
Got an invite to St Thomas of Acon and while I‚Äôve found places that sell most of the regalia the 20.5‚Äù sword is never in any of the packages 

Anyone got a decent link?
picked this up today at a oddities expo looks fun

Square and Compass? üòÖ

Don't get mad at me but this post is about...
Rings, lol.

I'm curious about the stories of how you decided on a Master Mason ring.

Many of you brothers likely purchased new, or had one passed down, maybe even got them as gifts from your lodge/family...

I've seen many styles, types, some gaudy, some understated, & they all have their places imo because each brother is different so should be his adornments.

Personally I've been searching flea markets & pawn shops in my area because I feel like it would be cool to carry on the tradition of a brother who is no longer with us, so I haven't purchased one as of yet.

So come on, be good sports & share your stories.

Thanks!
Looking for Central Texas Mason Lawyer
I am looking to hire a freemason lawyer located in or near central Texas. (Belton/Temple/Austin/Round Rock/Georgetown areas). My father (may he Rest in peace) was a very involved master mason in many parts of the world and 33rd degree Shriner and was also Special Forces Green Beret/101st Airborne Ranger (if you may so happen to know any special forces lawyers). Hoping to find one that specializes in divorce/mediation/custody as my ex is giving me a hard time during this separation when he was the one that chose to be unfaithful to me and his daughter. Please let me know if you can help a niece out with this I would be forever grateful. üíñ Thank you
A brother in distress
Does anyone know any brother attorneys in Florida preferably Polk County or Hillsborough ? 

Going through a real messy divorce from the UK with an American wife in Florida and would prefer a brothers help.
What kind of business would the community like to see on the first floor of this building located in Lansingburgh. . No bodegas or corner stores. Is there anyone out there looking to start a business.

Freemasonry has helped me so much in my personal growth. There have been several life changing moments in my Masonic journey so far but I don‚Äôt really know who to talk to about it.
I‚Äôm a MM in the UK, genuinely have immense respect and appreciation for everyone I have met/spoke to so far in freemasonry. The thing I‚Äôm wondering is, is it appropriate to talk about some of the more ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù aspects of freemasonry with other members of my lodge. It‚Äôs a very personal thing and I don‚Äôt get the impression it is something they would want to sit down and have an in depth conversation about. 
I have so many questions and I know that some of it will become clearer with time, and experience, but I also don‚Äôt want to miss out on learning from other‚Äôs experiences and being able to meet with people who share similar interests in the more philosophical/spiritual aspects of freemasonry. I‚Äôm hoping there are lodges, groups that I can get involved with that are more focussed on this area.
I just accidentally found out my dad was a freemason
I was in his wardrobe as he asked me to get something for him and i stumbled upon a box with letters pins cuff links the whole lot. i have not an idea what freemasonry is about and i‚Äôm hoping someone could shed some light on it?
How do you protect your warrants?
I tried finding a sleeve to put mine in but it's an odd size so I had no luck. I tried finding a scroll case thinking that would be really cool, but again, its odd size made it impossible to find a scroll case to fit it.

I ask you, Brethren, how do you protect your ~~warrants~~ patents? I don't want to just chuck mine in my briefcase to get torn up.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Meant to say "patent" not "warrant."

Don't Understand Masonry
How come people get punished for revealing secrets of masonry?

Starting a fraternity
Greetings all!

I want to be as transparent as possible. I was a master Mason in the state of Arizona but fell into some financial problems. This was about 5 years ago and I do have a desire to become an active member once again. However, I have a passion to create my own fraternity/ social club focusing on a particular cause with my own set of rules and rituals (none similar to Masonry of course). 

My questions are.. is this something that would be frowned upon? Is it best to take it up with my GL? Am I able to pursue both? I‚Äôve taken all the necessary steps to become successful. I just have to recruit at this point. I‚Äôm just double checking to ensure I‚Äôm not causing any problems. I‚Äôm in Michigan btw. Thank you for your time.
I had quite a few people asking to see the Bible, so I thought I'd post it here. There is alot of Masonic stuff in here(obviously) that I didn't post because I didn't know if its the kind of stuff kept between Masons or not.

Oh brother how thou has forsaken me
O my beloved brother who once watched over my back . My guardian angel why have you forsaken me the children who once played In my garden .he who once gave the poor his daily bread how thou has forsaken me .

Masonic Ring
Any recommendations for where I can get a decent quality masonic ring?
The most masonic song
I heard this song a while ago, from a rapper called Apathy, it truly inspired me to read more about freemasonry (I am not one though).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSBcbpJGWjA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSBcbpJGWjA)

I am a big fan of hip-hop, and he made freemasonry look cool with that song, I am reading an introductory book about it, and I hope someday I will understand what he is saying.

I don't know what's the propose of this post, but I just thought of sharing this with someone, so why not with freemasons themselves.
Misinformation
Hello, I am from Rhode Island, the smallest state but one of the Richest in history .
I have grown up with the Shriners and Masons around me, they used to come to my schools and they have built hospitals. 
I have 0 prejudice to anyone I am completely atheist. 
The only readily available research on Freemasons seems loaded with agenda. 
When I have tried to track down quotes to morals and Dogma by Albert Pike it has resulted me in different versions (or editions) that being said how do I read morals and dogma in tbe Raw?
I have been quoted many things I can‚Äôt verify and have stumbled upon diffferent versions of moral and Dogma l, how do I know what I am reading it legitimate? 

P.S i am merely a Irish American with no relation to the masons besides factI went to tbe Shriners hospital as a child how do I discern Mis info from genuine info
Looking for guidance.
Hello Brothers, I am a fellowcraft from the US. Today I write this for guidance. For the past 2 years, I have been out of Lodge due to personal reasons and self-battles. the past few weeks I have wanted to go back but the past few times of reaching out some brothers have been short with me. Just recently I had a tragic event happen to my family and I called a brother who only talked to me for about 4 minutes and quickly got off the phone without really asking me how I was doing. Am I just overthinking this should I just show up at the next lodge meeting? I have spent the past year bettering myself for my family and my 1-year-old son and wish i never stopped going to lodge. Thanks in advance for your time Brothers

Book Recommendations
Greetings Brethren! 

For those living north of the equator, I hope you're staying warm!

I would like for you to recommend some books mainly focusing on the historical aspect of Freemasonry rather than the esoteric one. I'm currently reading Bro. Chris Hodapp's book (conspiracy theories and secret societies). I'm very much interested in the American and French Revolutions and the role of masonry but then again I'm a sucker for anything history-related. 

Also I would really appreciate it if you'd recommend anything that'd further advance my masonic education. 

Thanks in advance!
Ohio background check
Any Ohio Masons experiencing difficulty with the background check process? 

The duty has fallen in my lap to help prospecting and new members walk through the beginning steps. As well as mentoring through each degree.

It's been a positive experience so far but I'm having one issue. The background check process always takes forever and is more confusing than it should be.

The last three took well over a month to get back. We have one person waiting on his background check and it's been close to 2 months he's been waiting now.

My dad had to end up getting the background check done twice and paid for it two times. I really would like to avoid that if possible because I don't feel it's fair to the candidate.

Does anyone have any experience with this or know anything more about it? Or maybe just some advice on what to say to explain the difficulty with the situation again and again without discouraging anyone. Thanks in advance!
Any ideas?

Where do you usually buy masonic ring, dear brethren?
Are there any good online shops to buy and has an option to customize? Like to engrave lodge logo?
Joining Red Lodge Soon
Greetings Brethren.

I will be joining Royal Arch Masonry soon and am trying to find some clarification on symbols. I want to put in an order for a ring but am unsure which is appropriate and do not want to read any spoilers to knowledge I have not yet attained the right to. 

Thanks for the help if possible.
Challenge Coin from my first mentor
Was given this coin by my first mentor. Both of us are military (he's a marine, I'm a soldier) and he gave this to me before he transfered. I've carried this with me on a daily basis since he gave it to me to remind me of our friendship and my obligations as a Mason to teach and mentor other Brothers.
My best friend became a mason last night
My best friend since 8th grade became an entered apprentice last night. It was a pleasure to be apart of his degree (as chaplain and delivered charge). Very proud of him, and can‚Äôt wait to assist in coaching.
[X-post] A little slice of heaven

Bridgeport valley
To all the brethren that make Thursday night at the rite possible, I can‚Äôt thank you all enough. Great performance! Coming from a military mason, you all deserve a Bravo Zulu. The 28 degree, Knight of the Sun, was quite impactful. Believe me gentleman real jewelry isn‚Äôt made from gold, the real jewelry is the man himself. Safe travels!
Hi friends, my petition was recently accepted! Out of curiosity, can an EA wear a Masonic watch?
I am in the United States, and I already understand the rules about wearing rings, but I haven't seen anyone mention watches specifically.
Tonight at the Valley of Rockville Centre AASR NMJ, we were treated to a special lecture by Ill. Bro. Moises Gomez 33rd¬∞ who spoke on the symbolism of the Holy Royal Arch. We also had a watch party viewing of the 28th¬∞ Knight of the Sun. A wonderful #nightattherite #aasr #nmj #Scottishrite

Wish me luck brothers üòÅ
I currently sit as JW in the south. My SW and WM will be absent for our stated meeting tonight and I'll running the meeting as WM for the first time. 
As title says, wish me luck.
If I join Freemasonry, can I be sworn in on my own bible?
I'm very sorry if this seems like a dumb question, but I'm interested in becoming a Mason and I remember hearing that you get sworn into Freemasonry on a bible at the Lodge. My Great-Grandfather was a Master Mason and I have his personal Masonic Bible, and I was curious as to if I could be sworn in using his Bible? Once again, I'm very sorry if this is a dumb question.

Masonic Music Sheet Music
Brothers! I am looking for Sheet Music for Festive Board songs.  Songs like the Worshipful Masters song, the Entered Apprentice song etc.  I have found the lyrics, but I can't seem to find the Sheet Music.  Does anyone here know where it is? Is it downloadable?  Thanks for taking a look.

Remembering The Words Of A Brother
Today I ran across an old essay I'd written in 2021, while I was in Mexico if memory serves.  It closed with a truly wonderful quote:

*‚ÄúAttracted only by favorable report, teeming thousands, ignorant of its internal workings, continually seek admission ‚Äòunsolicited by friends and unbiased by mercenary motives.‚Äô Mighty Legions march forward under its banners, succoring the widow, the orphan and the destitute, practicing charity, loyal to country and worshiping God.‚Äù*

Those words are from MW Brother John I. Newell, and are a part of the Official Ritual of the MW York Grand Lodge of Mexico.  They have always struck me as being quite powerful, so I thought I'd share them for everyone here.

My essay, that included MW Newell's quote, was about images of mortality within our Craft.  It is here: [https://emeth.substack.com/p/images-of-mortality](https://emeth.substack.com/p/images-of-mortality) if anyone wants to give it a read.

When the Esoteric Boys Attend a Lodge & Building Management Meeting

Interested in joining, figured id ask Reddit before reaching out to local members more seriously. Hard to find honest feed back on the internet, mostly nonmembers & conspiracy theorists sharing their thoughts. Would love to hear from members on, what made you join? What are the benefits of joining ?

Just moved to a new area down the street from a lodge, is there a way to introduce myself in a way that is based in respect and curiosity?
Hey all, 


Hoping to get some advice or feedback. I just moved to a new area, and as I approach a more stable period in life, I‚Äôd like to explore the idea of joining a lodge.


I have read up on lodges and freemasonry in general, and it has always appealed to me in a fraternal sense, but I am wondering if there is a good way to go about introducing myself.


Any advice or insight is more than appreciated.


General location is coastal Los Angeles.
Looks familiar

How do I study?
I am an entered apprentice and am excited to progress through the degrees.  To do that I need to study, how do I study if I can't write anything down?
P.S. 
My memory is not the best.
Awkwardness related to switching local lodges
There's a lodge in the town that I live in, but I am a member of the one 10 miles away. When I moved to this area about two years ago, I chose the farther one because it has higher attendance rate, and I had also made a quick connection with the Secretary. I was told (truthfully) that my local one could barely scrape together enough guys on any given month. 

I know it was totally my decision/fault to go ahead and join my current one without even visiting the "weaker" one...oops, but now that I've finally been to the local one, I think I like it better. The guys seem more my vibe, there's another "young" guy, and I like the actual lodge building more. And of course it's closer to home 

All of that being said, it feels really weird to consider switching since everyone more or less knows each other in both lodges. It feels like an insult or betrayal to my current lodge, and I can't exactly just say "I like this one more". I'm JD currently so this is more of a future/next year thought, but does anyone have experience in a similar situation? How can I avoid hurt/bad feelings?
To identify a piece of regalia
Hello there,
I am a dormant MM and recently inherited some regalia from my late father-in-law, a mason from Chile. Among the several recognisable items I found this blue and red silk sash, with a jewel (see image) that I do not recognise. Please could you help?
Thanks.
Get your light out there
I was at a district council meeting last night, at which we had a guest speaker from another district. One of the suggestions he proposed was to have regular activities out in public where people can see you, and perhaps interact. These don't need to be child ID programs or things like that. Even regular meetups for coffee to discuss books at a local coffee shop will work. 

For example, one of his lodges regularly meets for a light dinner at a local place, and a lot of the patrons have come to realize who they are, and will sometimes wander over to ask questions. This made me think about how "we" used to meet in pubs. 

And *that* got me wondering if perhaps the move to only meet in our private buildings has hidden us away from the public eye, to the point where people sort of know what masons are, but have no way of knowing who they are or what they are like in real life. 

I k now that it's not easy for those of us who have young families or jobs with odd work hours. But I'm thinking that there's some merit in having regular meetings - that is, meet ups - where we can be seen and heard. 

Anyone else do anything like this? How did it work out for you?
Another masonic post card (1914)

I was asked last night if I had been a professional actor...
... and it made me smile. I often get those comments. Yes, I had professional training as an actor and had worked in the theater in my younger years. But my acting career never took off for various reasons, some valid (I wasn't *that* good), some by choice (I was more valuable as an administrator) and others beyond my control. 

But with the ritual, I get a chance to chew the scenery a bit and exercise those skills that have been dormant for so long. I worry about sticking out like a sore thumb at times, but on the other hand, I think others are taking the presentation of the ritual more seriously because of it. 

Anyway, these comments are so validating to me, especially as I sometimes feel like I was a failure as an actor.

I pay no mind to the brothers who complain that due to my ability to project my voice the ritual can be heard clearly outside the lodge room and onto the street; those who rely on hearing aids are grateful.
Australian Scottish Rite - Christian vs Universal Rite
I recently found out that within the Scottish Rite - Australian constitution there is the traditional Christian Rite as well as a recently established (last 10 years or so) a universal rite accepting those of all faiths. 
Does anybody have experience with the universal rite and know how it compares to the Christian one or non-Christian exclusive American and European versions?
Any recommendations for my first LOI?
EA here with my first LOI this week. Anything I need to know in preparation? The only thing I've been told is to bring my cypher.

Is there any advice or insight that you can share about LOI (without reveling any secrets of course) that may be helpful? Thank you brothers!

Lodge of Debate & Discussion
Fraternal Greetings Brethren,

MM from Sydney Aus. here. I have been a long time member of my local Lodge of Instruction and recently had an idea that I'm putting to the boys in my district you guys might be interested in.

Effectively what I want to do is for a lodge like a LoI with a Preceptor instead of a WM and have it serve a slightly different purpose. I'd like to see the lodge open to a short 15-20 minute lecture on a topic of masonic knowledge and then have the lodge declared open for discussion and debate on that subject. There would be time at the end of each meeting for brethren to rise and suggest a topic for next the next meeting and for people to offer/discuss next meetings opening lecture.

What are the thoughts on this? have anyone done/seen similar before?

(If you type some version of the phrase "it will never work because..." please kindly keep that to yourself)
A Question on Brotherhood
I've mentioned this in a few posts, I am a newly initiated EA, so I am green and wet behind the ears with respect to my own masonic journey. I have a lot of respect and admiration for the fraternity and have to ask this to the wider masonic community: At what point did other masons feel like your brothers? Is it something we just say without a thought i.e brothers and brethren or are there some of you out there who truly feel a sense of brotherhood. I'd hope my own journey gets me to a point where I can call other masons brothers in the most genuine sense of the word.
Input wanted
My great grandfather was a Brother, my grandfather died when I was young and no one was there to answer my questions or excite my interests. When I was of proper age, I reached out to GL of my state and was contacted by a local lodge. I visited, petitioned and was etc. Raised eventually. As someone with a prior esoteric interest and background I was let down by the way things were conducted and eventually decided to no longer attend. Everything was rushed along and short formed and done with multiple candidates etc to try and keep my explanation brief. Don't get me wrong there are some wonderful Brothers out there but my love for the craft seemed one sided and that I expected a standard that was simply not met or answered. I was so let down by something that I gave my heart and dedication to. Idk if it's just my jurisdiction which I will refrain from posting publicly out of respect. Long story short. I still have a place and want and need for Masonry in my life and in my heart, although I may not seek out to attend until I've relocated to another area in hopes of better experience and Brotherhood. I would like to start from square one again, in a place where things are done the right way and taken seriously. Has anyone seen or heard of this? Doing degrees over re-initiation etc? Any help or guidance is much appreciated. Love and Light to each and every one of you. How pleasant it is...

Edit: 
First and foremost, I greatly appreciate the Brothers who took the time and read and respond to my post. 
My solution would be to find another lodge where things are conducted accordingly. 
I have visited a number of lodges locally and also held an officers position. I am not some YouTube expert. I was raised in 2012 And I did stick around for a good amount of time, feeling and voicing that considerations should be made for future, before I chose to step away.
Joining a line of officers in current placement is not something I'd be interested in, as my opinion has already been voiced but not heard or received. But I am confident in different setting that is absolutely something I would LOVE to do. 
I was not looking for a more "occult" experience, just proper ritual. I have realistic expectations.
It is not a lack of understanding of the ritual itself. It was the  manner it was conducted as a whole. Actually because of my understanding of the ritual I was even more let down, these guys are striking out on all fronts. 
My experience has been, that at least locally, all anybody cares about is getting more guys in, rushing things along to pump numbers up and that is obviously not the reason or meaning for Masonry. 

Your responses have been greatly appreciated.
Finding info on relatives?
I've tried to reach out to family for info but was unanswered and disregarded. Is there any way to get any information on a Brother like what lodge or any officer positions held? I know my great grandfather was a Brother in Scotland long ago. Is this something I can contact UGLE and request? Does anybody have any experience with a similar thing or advice for me? 
Thank you in advance.

Master Mason Diplomas
I have recently ordered seven Master Mason Diplomas from McCoy publishing but they have gone missing in the mail.

Scottish Rite
Thinking about joining Scottish rite and I was curious with so many degrees which apron and other regalia do you wear and why?  Not a very serious uis question just for my curiosity and also thinking about the monetary commitment as well. I am in the NMJ.
Hypothetical question about irregular rites/orgs
Let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs a body practicing some generally unrecognized rite such as Memphis-Misraim. Let‚Äôs say that they, for the sake of attracting more members, entirely stopped working the first three degrees and relinquish any claim to ‚Äúmake masons‚Äù. Would it still be a violation of my oaths to join them? 

My thinking is no. As long as they are not practicing the first three degrees, it is not a violation of my oaths to join them.

But then I get uncertain when I consider the scenario that they might decide to require you to be a master mason - from a list of their own recognized masonic obediences that might not match mine.

What do you think?

(And before you ask: yes this is 100% hypothetical - not a real situation I‚Äôm considering)
In accordance with my personal tradition, I humbly present my January travels of 2023.

My Brother and I had a great time traveling to Canton Ohio this past weekend

Any Freemason‚Äôs near Toledo Ohio?
I‚Äôm looking to join a Lodge by my house. But nobody responded to my email. To be honest I‚Äôm a Hispanic male who gets confused with being a black male. I know that there are different lodges for different races. Could this be a reason I can‚Äôt get into certain Lodges? I want to get together with like minded brothers to help lift fallen humanity. Can anyone guide me in the right direction? Thank you!
Going to DC
I‚Äôm in college and my spring break is coming up. I‚Äôm going to dc since my dad has to go there for work which means I don‚Äôt have to pay for a hotel I‚Äôbe been a bunch of times but each time I always see something new. So far my plan is to see the house of the temple and The George Washington Masonic Museum any other mason related sites I should see. I was planing a day trip to Monticello as well and maybe a stop to Fredericksberg too and I am thinking about visiting George Washingtons lodge.  I am an EA about to be passes to FC. Any recommendations would be much appreciated.

Great granddaughter of a Freemason
Don't know much about Freemasonry but this is my great grandfather.  Don't know if I should put his name here or not but we're from Ohio around the Akron area. I was close with my great grandfather but just came into this info about him belonging with the Masons within the past 3yrs. I would be very appreciative if someone could tell me anything from seeing his pic. If his name is needed I will provide that also. I didn't know where else to ask.  Thank you in advance ‚ò∫
Challenge coin ideas
So a few brothers and I all have a challenge coin, which has been good fun in the short time we've had them, but we haven't really worked out a feasible consequence for not having it on you. It seems like the traditional answer is that the person who doesn't have it has to buy a round of drinks, but most of the time that we get together, it's at places where the booze is free. We also toyed with the idea that the empty handed person has to take a shot, but it didn't get a lot of support for a variety of reasons. 

So I'm coming to you guys to see if anyone's come up with a clever idea. We all drink, so it could definitely be something alcohol related, but I kind of feel like we might as well make it mason related. 

Actually, as I'm writing this, I just had a thought: the "loser" has to go up to the brother of the group's choosing and recite the EA obligation. It could be the oldest, most grouchy PM in lodge, or a higher ranking officer if one happens to be around (last time this came up we were at an event with the DD present).
Guidance on finding a lodge
To begin, the principles behind (what I have read or researched) regarding freemasonry and the York rite are fascinating to me. I live in a smaller Texas town and was curious on what you all would recommend to find a lodge. I love learning and am very interested in working my way through the levels for this reason. I also like the self exploration as well as the guiding principles offered through achieving each level. 

So, how should I go about finding a lodge?  I know there is a small local lodge but as many have written here, there‚Äôs something to be said for the connections with the brothers. Granted, not much is online for each lodge which makes this challenging. I am also curious if learning the lessons for each level are similar to that of a larger lodge?  I‚Äôve read online that small lodges often have this issue as the ceremonies are tougher to coordinate in a small lodge. 

I hope this makes sense‚Ä¶ having come from the military previously, the instructions, rank, and relationships are everything. I don‚Äôt believe in doing anything half way and would not want to just drive around ‚Äòshopping‚Äô and inadvertently waste someone‚Äôs time or insult them by joining another lodge.
Submitted inquiries to CA Grand Lodges - what next?
I did the online submission for Grand Lodge of CA, Co-Masonry, and Prince Hall. The firwt two have directed me to the lodges nearest me - Downtown Masonic and Glendale. 

I am of the understanding that they are busy with other applicants and it may take a while for them to get to me (good for them, no problem here!)

With that in mind, is there anything I can do while I'm waiting for my (metaphorical) number to be called? Is it inappropriate to call/email other lodges directly and ask about attending dinner or a public event? 

I've seen elsewhere on here that one should "go in blind" - don't study, don't research. Can do. What *should* I do if I'm working to determine if Masonry (and what kind) is right for me, and I for it?

Of interest: visiting brethren from a differing constitution
I was perusing through the sub and came across a discussion on being challenged in church.

This raised the question in my head as to how (broadly) challenges may be conducted by lodges where brethren are visiting from a different constitution, and a different country -

To illustrate: in the Irish Constitution (South Africa), our challenges consist of the due guard, true guard, grips, and passwords, we also have certificates from GL of Ireland declaring one to be a MM, as well as letter from secretaries who have contacted the lodge to be visited. 

Would displaying these be sufficient in light of factthat in the Irish we don't (at least in South Africa), we don't do emulation in the sense of "where is a man first made a Mason" and those similar sorts of questions; so if I were to be asked that line of questioning, I'd be completed flummoxed.

Really, my question revolves around what could I perhaps expect (broadly), if being challenged when visiting say a US lodge?

Put off too long?
I've had great influences in my life recomend I visit a lodge with them, when I felt I was ready I was faced with a completely different life. PTSD from OIF in 2010 kicked in. I've had to learn how to live a completely different life. It's been very difficult to hold a job with the symptoms. This shame has kept me from visiting a lodge. Integrity and loyalty are values that I find are imparative in my life. I've been told I should visit a lodge because I'm a man who's interested in becoming a better man with every day I'm blessed with. I post to ask if my concerns are valid, I've always felt that I need to be more successful than my current situation to participate. Thank you for your time.

Question for everyone....
So my question is....what is the rules about business cards?  I have seen some people who have cards with their name and number and info and have like a masonic theme and I have seen some who have a masonic logo on their business card.  Are there specific by laws or rules that speak on the matter one way or another?

Poet Laureate of Freemasonry
Hello, dear Brothers of Reddit!

I am a literary scholar with great respect and love for the Order (recently found out that my grandad was most likely a Freemason) trying to find out as much information as I can about the honorary title/office of Poet Laureate of Freemasonry. I know that Robert Burns was one, and also Keats (despite not being a Mason himself), Tennyson (unsurprisingly, as he wrote ¬´Crossing the Bar¬ª) and others.

Do any of you know what the official requirements are to become Poet Laureate, what other prominent figures attained this honour (both Masons and prophanes), or other data of interest? Maybe you'd like to help by sharing some poems? I'm all ears and wish you all the best!
A friend of mine said all that freemasons do is stay up all night, drink, and play chess. Is that true?

The yarn is in! I‚Äôve got a lot of trimming work to do but I‚Äôm pretty pleased. You can see the left side of the square has been trimmed a little, compared to the right side that is untouched.

Raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason
Tonight, I was Raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason. It's really hard to even attempt to put into words what this means to me.

     I've met so many people that I'm happy to call my brothers. So many more I still have yet to meet but now have a plan of Travel to do so. If we haven't met yet, I feel as though we will very soon.

I started my Masonic Career in New Jersey, and flew back to be raised here at Warren Lodge #13  the brothers there in Belvidere, NJ and the other brothers that came from all around the 14th District to hold the degree, I thank you, most sincerely... seriously if it wasn't for you men and the time you put in, it wouldn't of been the way it was and I thank you for that. Darcy Lodge #37 F.&A.M.  I want to thank you guys as well, for bringing me into this fraternity the right way, and sending me off to Texas the same.

NOW, to my new Texas Brothers, The personalize shout-out for my Raising also, goes beyond words. I was not expecting that at all, such an extended welcoming into the fraternity. I was almost brought to tears that you took the time out of you day/night to do that for me, and it means so much to me, I only hope to be able to contribute to each and every one of you in some way. This is definitely just the beginning and I can't wait to join you in a lodge room.

Hello everyone, I have 3 rings that belonged to my father. He passed away 5 years ago and I'm not too sure what to do with the rings he left behind. I'm not a member so I feel it disrespectful to wear any of the rings myself.

Just a question before I go knocking
I‚Äôve been doing a lot of research and been interested in joining for a long time. I‚Äôm up in Ct and we have a huge list of lodges. What I‚Äôve noticed is that each one carries a specific name like Harmony, King Solomon, or Federal. Not sure if the answer out of my reach but what‚Äôs up with the different names and Is it of any significance which one you join? Thanks in advance!
Old Pics

Masonic Pins and Note.
So, this is a 25-year Masonic Pin I received from a relative who is not a mason but wanted me to have the pins as he knows I am a Mason and very active.

I cleaned the pins (polished and buffed) and they came out looking good.  The craftmanship of the 25 year pin is incredible compared to todays pins.  It has a screw and nut fastener on the back, is sterling silver and the details on the seal are vibrant.

The pins are from a Mason who lived in Atlantic City New Jersey and owned several barber shops. He was also a close confidant of Mayor Bacharach and an ally of Enoch ‚ÄúNucky‚Äù Johnson.  This brother went to the "Lodge on High" in 1940

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch\_L.\_Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_L._Johnson)

There are also two Masonic Slipper Pins in the jewelry box. The Slipper Pin is for a Masonic Wife or a close family member (daughter, niece etc.).

For a quick background see this article from Lafayette Lodge 199, Pennsylvania.

[https://lafayettelodge199.com/2018/03/26/the-history-of-the-masonic-blue-slipper](https://lafayettelodge199.com/2018/03/26/the-history-of-the-masonic-blue-slipper)

When checking the jewelry box, we found a folded note under the pin holder and written on it is the following.

*Hi!* *My father brought a masonic pin (small one in lid of this box) for May and for me to wear in Europe summer of 1932.* *He thought his Masonic brothers and sisters that we might meet would recognize by our wearing it that we were O.K. young women.* *We did* *not* *always were them.*

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this post and the photos!

U.S. Scottish Rite Craft (Blue Lodge) degrees.
Hello, I would like to get some information on brothers that have gone through the "recognized" Scottish Rite Blue Lodge degrees in the U.S. (The first 3 degrees sometime incorrectly referred as red degrees).

In my understanding these first Scottish three degrees are practiced in two Lodges from California (That were formed before the GL of California), in Washington D.C. that opened their Grand Lodge to different rites such as Emulation, French, McBride, Scott... And the most famous, Louisiana that retained multiple Scottish Rite Lodges from its old French Speaking GL. (And recently opened a new one outside of the designated district if I do not mistake).

So here are my questions;

1. How was your experience, what it very similar to York Rite Blue Lodge or really different?

2. Would you have rather done it in a York rite lodge for a similar experience of most of the U.S. brother or are you happy to have gone though a less known system in the U.S. ( I am aware that it's the most common world wide)

3. Are you for or Against other GL to follow the footsteps and open to different rites? (Blue Lodge wise)

4. Do you see the same problem with membership that York Rite Blue Lodge are experiencing? 

5. Is there any other GL that has Scottish rite blue Lodges? Or another rite that the York? 

Thank you for your help brothers.

Order of the Eastern Star
Hello,
My late father belonged to the lodge, and was an active brother for many, many years. I was going through his things and found a box of my grandfather's military medals, as well as his freemasonry pins and other items (cufflinks, tie clips, etc.).

I found an Order of the Eastern Star pin and I'm curious to find more out. Google searches of course don't return much. He was in the Canadian navy during WWII.

I also found a lot of my father's ceremonial aprons and other items. What can I do with the items that I do not need or want to keep? I'm not associated with the lodge personally, especially as a woman but I can appreciate that these items do not belong in a landfill.

List of Grand Lodges in the USA that allow transgender men?
Brethren,

I am a Mason under the Grand Lodge of Virginia.

Having a conversation with a Brother from another jurisdiction recently, I learned that their Grand Lodge allows trans men to become Masons. My Grand Lodge has no protections for trans men who petition, and we do not, to my knowledge, have any trans men in the Craft. I believe our petition also states that the applicant for the Degrees in Freemasonry must have been "born a male."

I am interested to collect and publish information on the current status of transgender men in Freemasonry, in general, but I am particularly interested in American Blue Lodges. I have assembled a survey. If you are so inclined, please complete it, and when I have enough data I will publish the results.

[https://forms.gle/DV6gp1Zwx9uJXboZ8](https://forms.gle/DV6gp1Zwx9uJXboZ8)

If you know if this kind of study of transgenderism in Freemasonry that has yet been completed and the data are available, would you be so kind as to share it here or send me a message with this information?

S+F

edit: this is a sociological exercise, not a conversation about trans acceptance. I want data. Your downvotes do not advance our knowledge of the prevalence of transgenderism in Freemasonry.

Happy Burns Night
Wishing everyone throughout the world, who will be celebrating, the life and poetry of Scotlands own Rabbie Burns tonight...
What can I do *right now*?
I‚Äôm sixteen years old and I would like to become a Mason once I hit 18. Is there anything I can do right now that could help me in the future? Are there any Masons who joined at a relatively young age who can speak to your experience as a young man in an organization I hear is predominantly made up of middle aged to older men?

Edit: A Mason from here, who‚Äôs name I do not know but whose actions I do not appreciate, reported me to Reddit‚Äôs suicide prevention program. As if disagreeing with wanting to join DeMolay for personal (but apparently controversial) reasons was a sign of some deep-seated mental issue that needs to be addressed by professionals. If this is how the Masons treat everyone with a differing opinion or perspective on any one issue I‚Äôm not entirely surprised that Freemasonry is failing to be taken up by the younger crowd.

Younger members in your lodge?
Hi all. I wonder your experience with initiating young men in your lodges. 

Do you have many younger members?

Do the younger members usually integrate well? 

What have you found to be good topics of conversation to get to know each other better as a Mason?
Is there a ‚Äúpaywall‚Äù?
Is there a substantial monetary investment in joining Freemasonry? I‚Äôve been considering trying to join with my local lodge. I have a contact there who I know through family. When we last spoke, he was telling me I should ‚Äúget my bread right‚Äù before I come speak to him. It wasn‚Äôt in a rude, or condescending fashion. I was admittedly pretty broke and young at the time. It could have just been general advice. But I just want to be sure before I start the process. TIAüôèüèæ

Question on a ring design
I‚Äôm in PA and i‚Äôm designing a new MM ring, what‚Äôs your opinions on whether or not to include or exclude the G from inside the square and compasses?  I know it‚Äôs a mostly-US tradition to include it, but I kind of like the aesthetic of it without it, thoughts?
I need help for a presention list.
Dear Brethren, Waarde broeders,

I'm asking for your help on this one.

Last week i visited another lodge, because my own lodge was working in the 2nd degree and i'm still an EA. This lodge however did something interesting. They have found an original presention list from the 1800's, this has been copied and placed upon the entrance when a new candidate is being initiated. So when you visit, you can write your name on the paper. Afterwards the list will be given to the new brother. Fantastic right!? Well ofcourse, so yesterday i asked the brothers of my own lodge, if they think this tradition would be fitting for our lodge as well.

Well you guessed it. I got the task of delivering the prototype to the WM before this weekend. (Initiation monday).

Does anyone here know someone who can make a medieval-style presention list? With symbolism of course. 

&#x200B;

Yours fraternally, MBG,

Edit; the extension with symbolism. 
I‚Äôve had a few things grabbing my attention since the last post. However, I‚Äôm making progress today. What do we think?

Strange Symbol- Do you recognize this?

Any recommendation for educational scientific books/documentaries in the scope of Freemasonry teachings?

How Does Moving Work?
Hello Freemasons!

I have just been invited to attend a lodge dinner and meet some of the members. I‚Äôm pretty excited and also kind of nervous. I am in my mid 20s and am a little worried I may stick out like a sore thumb, just like in church. üòÖ While this isn‚Äôt a big deal and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get over it, I am also concerned about a potential move that may be upcoming. 

I may or may not be moving back home in around 6-7 months, which is in the next state over. I am also finishing my undergraduate part-time online, and am working full-time for a local company. I know Freemasons prefer petitioning people to be ‚Äòrelatively stable‚Äô in their life. Would you recommend I still meet with the group, or do you think I would wait until I have more solid roots? 

I‚Äôd hate to waste either of our time, and I do want to give petitioning a Lodge the seriousness it deserves. From what I have read online and in some books, freemasonry seems like a cool and historic way to grow in my personal life, but it also requires some time and dedication to get the most out of it. 

Thanks for any and all input!
The basis for the WM being the only one allowed to wear a hat in lodge, and if there is actual code against it.
So I had the discussion with a brother about this, as we had initiated a Sikh wearing a head covering during his degree, and my brother questioned whether we violated code by allowing him to do so .  He had stated that it was against the code.  So I read the code (GL of F&A Masons of WI) completely, and could find no mention of it.  Does anyone else have it in their GL code?  Where and when did this tradition come about?  Do any of your jurisdictions not follow it?

CLARIFICATION: Is there code against a person besides a WM wearing a hat in lodge? And I know what the rationale for only allowing the WM to do it is. Just wondering if this is more a respected practice, or a requirement.
Granddaughter wearing Grandfather‚Äôs ring
This is probably an unusual question but I‚Äôm looking for input. I am female and have great respect for Freemasonry. I‚Äôd join in a heartbeat if I could! ! My grandfather died before I was born and was a 32nd degree and a Shriner. He took it seriously but died at 49. I have inherited his ring and would love to wear it to honor him and also because I am on a learning path myself so to honor his work. I know it‚Äôs not approved if if a man wears a ring if he‚Äôs not a member. What about a woman? Would it be disrespectful?

Good afternoon. I am really interested in masonry and being part of the community. My question is, what is masonry‚Äôs view on Taoism. Could I be a part of this community as a Taoist. Would I be able to use the Tao as my book. Thank you all for any insight you can provide.

First meeting tonight
Having my first meeting tonight with the master and another mason of the lodge, meeting at a pub, just wondering what to except.
Interested in freemasonry as a young man
I‚Äôve been reading a lot of about astronomy and freemasonry as of recently. Finding out my grandfather was a mason really turned my attention to the craft more so out of curiosity. Reading books about it really started to blow my mind, and things started to connect more from my previous occult endeavours. 

I have a superficial understanding of some of the symbols and their allegorical meanings related to astronomy and the path of the sun through the zodiac. But I want to learn more. I know the knowledge is passed down as you go up in degrees. But I want to find out if it‚Äôs worth it. I have a thirst for knowledge and have been interested in the mystery teachings for some time now. 

Im also interested in the moral aspects of and becoming a better man. Could freemasonry be what I‚Äôm looking for?

Travel, work, and receive Master's Wages
First of all, I wanted to say a quick thank you to the Brethren who assisted me in working my way through the intricacies of GLNF! You helped me to better understand how the system works there and for that I am eternally grateful!

As for the subject of this post, I can not stress how valuable and enriching travelling is as a Master Mason. I've travelled much over the years, both within my jurisdiction and elsewhere, and the experience is always amazing. From seeing how other Lodges, similar to your own, have their on eccentricities, to travelling in foreign lands and experiencing a whole different system of Freemasonry. Regardless of the differences, the biggest truth is the universality of Brotherhood no matter where you go! I have always received the warmest of welcomes when visiting.

This past week I was fortunate to visit my second French lodge. The ritual was certainly different, and although there were commonalities that I could follow even without speaking a word of French, it was interesting working out those specific differences. As expected, the French do not disappoint and the festive board was stellar on both occasions. The one thing that surprised me was the length of both the meeting and the festive board. On both occasions it was after 1AM before I got home from lodge. I was also fortunate to experience degree work both times, a fellow craft ceremony in Rite Ecossais Rectifi√© most recently an Initiation in Rite Ecossais Ancien et Accept√©. As the visitor from the most distant place, I was asked both times to give a toast and both times I reiterated the benefits of travelling, especially to the newest masons. Thankfully, at least one Brother was fluent in English at both meetings and was able to translate for me.

Finally, I shall leave you with a few photos of my recent visit and hope you can appreciate them just as much from afar!

Hello,

About 10 years ago I had taken the first degree when I was in college. Fast forward ten years later life got ahead of me and I have finally settled down and would love to reach out to a lodge near me and hopefully get involved again. There is a lounge not even 10 minutes from my house, is there a way to get in touch with them and see if I could talk to someone about this? ( I originally got involved by just asking someone I had become friends with at a local community group). To note I'm not living in that same state as I was back then.

Thanks for reading.

Edit: Please feel free to reach out to me, can provide lodge number and state that I joined at  or anything else that can help
Masonry across languages
Can anyone suggest a good English Masonic term that's the equivalent of the Spanish "plancha"? Our English-speaking lodge is installing a Spanish native speaker as WM and he'd like to bring a bit of his culture into the lodge.

He explained it as something like a lesson, but with the emphasis on the offering of the material without the assumption that the material would be absorbed by the listener. In other words (I think), "I will teach, you decide if you want to learn."

Are "Masonic teachings" a thing?

Thanks for any thoughts!

Petition questions
I‚Äôve been going to my local lodge the last 3 Times. Every time I‚Äôve loved it full of excitement. Last meeting I was one of the candidates petitioned for. Since then I have not heard from the investigators  does it still take a little time after the fact? I really want to just become a better man and I feel I‚Äôd be devastated if I got blackballed. I did ask the secretary after factwhat‚Äôs the next step. He said wait for a call. Is that hopeful enough for me?

I am looking to become a member without knowing any masons


From what I have read the masons are an overwhelmingly positive force on their community‚Äôs and help there fellow brothers. I am in a trade union and understand how fellowship and brotherhoods work. I would like to give my time help people and be part of a true brotherhood not one tainted by money corruption amount of work etc. a network that I could devote myself to and in turn be shown equal solace. 
1. Could I just show up to local meeting exhibit my desire for membership and attain a sponsor? Is this not the right way to go about this?
2. If I plan on moving from the local town the lodge is located in (not far as I live in new Jersey and u can drive through 4 different towns in less than 2 miles) is that ok?

Any advice would be appreciated i long to be part of something greater than myself. Help others and grow as a person.

Hidden Ring
Hi guys and girls.

I am not to adverse in the freemason world, but I do believe this ring belonged to a freemason atleast 5 or so decades ago. I was hoping to get some insight to potential meaning or anything that sticks out about the design.

The story behind how I acquired this ring was to me like how someone randomly stumbled upon a long lost treasure.

I was helping clean an old rundown attic for someone, I noticed a board on the ceiling hanging down from rotting around the nails.

Looked into the ceiling and saw a ring box just sitting there, and the previous owners who owned the house for 40ish years had no idea about it.

Any thoughts on the design/style? Thanks for any feedback
Any recommendation for documentaries to watch on Freemasonry?

I need some advice on how to exit masonry
Hi all,

I was introduced to masonry by my father-in-law, he's been a mason much of his life and is a grand officer rank within UGLE.

My wife, for many reasons (which I don't necessarily agree with), is against masonry, however, she only voiced her reservations and views toward our "secretive cult" once I became a mason which puts me in an incredibly difficult position.

I don't make masonry a large part of my life because of this, and I see the discomfort being a member causes her, so I want to respect that and step away from masonry.

My father-in-law is not an easy man to please, so saying at this stage (my 2nd planned in March) that I don't think it's quite right might not land too well. 

I'm asking for your support and ideas on how to approach this, what excuses would fit that means masonry isn't right for me? I don't want to drop my wife in it, despite the friction this has caused between us.

Brethren, any support would be greatly appreciated, I thank you deeply in advance.
Assistance With Lodge History
Hello everyone, I am a new MM in the U.S. 

I recently stepped into the appointed position of Historian for my lodge, and since then I have completed a lot of our lodges history with the assistance of another brother that shares the same passion for history as myself.

Our lodge was founded in 1850, and our temple was officially constructed in the early 1920s.

I was curious if any other brothers out there need assistance with locating obituaries of their deceased brethren, historical news articles about their lodge members, or any other history related inquiries. I am also a genealogist, so I can gather generic biographical information on brethren as well.
I am about to change commands, to be a Mason in Maryland USA must you be a resident of Maryland? I am interested in joining the fraternity. I am Active Duty military by the way.

Great turn out for stated tonight

I visited a lodge yesterday, and it was the worst ceremony I've ever seen
Nothing to do with the officers they did great, the candidate was assumed to be drunk and kept laughing and falling over the entire time. I'm obviously not gonna give a location or anyone's name, but I must say half the brothers left and not a single person congratulated him after...just unreal I was absolutely shocked.

European masonic online shop
Hello brothers,

Does anybody know of a reliable European masonic online shop?

I can only find American and British stores and even in my lodge they told it's better to get something from London when a brother is visiting.

Is it so bad?

I'm looking for a nice ring, as I was raised to the sublime degree last week and now i can wear masonic symbols. But I found only stuff made in china on Etsy, Amazon and eBay.

Job‚Äôs Daughters
I found out a few years back that my grandmother was part of the Job‚Äôs Daughters organization by finding photo slides of what appears to be some sort of induction ceremony in the 1950‚Äôs. Does that indicate that her Father was a Mason? What exactly is the affiliation here? I would turn to Google for these things normally but I feel like it‚Äôs a better idea to be asking on this forum.

Bricks mason website
Has anybody ordered anything from bricksmasons.com? I just received two rings I ordered, one for myself to replace a lost one and one as a gift for a good friend of mine who was just initiated as an EA to be given to him when he is raised to master mason and both rings showed up in an AliExpress bag with Chinese writing on them. I am a little upset about this because I thought I was purchasing rings from an American company. It says nowhere on their site that they are ultimately drop shippers. 

I called them and was told that they have many suppliers, and when I told them that the rings arrived in an AliExpress bag there was a long pause then they asked for proof, when I emailed them what they requested I called them back to make sure that they got it, and was told on the phone that they received it they will send it to upper management and they would prefer if I didn‚Äôt say anything to anybody about it Which is absolutely dishonest. The two rings i got were a total of $66 for plus $20 shipping and can be found on AliExpress for seven dollars each. Bricksmasons.com Are even using the same photos as the AliExpress sellers

Am I out of line for being upset? If I would‚Äôve known they were dropped shipped from China I wouldn‚Äôt of purchased them.

If anybody would like to see photos of my order or the exact rings on AliExpress, let me know and I‚Äôll post them

Interview
Hey all, this is my first post here so sorry if it's been asked before. I'm having a phone call with the Worshipful Master from my local lodge to essentially take my first steps of starting the masonic journey and was just wondering what kind of questions to expect. Thanks!
Someone please explain this incident on the road with a freemason.
So I managed to make a guy upset who was driving a car with Freemason sticker on his bumper. He was so upset in fact that as soon as we stopped at the next red light, he made a triangle shape hand gesture and extended his arms out forwards and liked at me through his hand triangle. Almost as if he was aiming at me. What in the world was he doing?
I did a little bit of work on the gold last night. Starting some outlines and borders today. Should I stick with the pictured colors, or does anyone think a different color scheme for the S&C base colors would look good?

How exactly would I go about joining the freemasons? I like the values and ideals and feel like it could be the place for me

What advantages do you have if you join in Freemasonry?

The Writings Of Albert Pike
I've encountered Masons for a long time now who take a dim view of our Brother Albert Pike.  This attitude seems to grow stronger the farther one is physically from the Southern Jurisdiction Scottish Rite.  I've always presumed that most who take this dim view misinterpret his words or the times in which he lived.  And of course, given that his most famous works are very difficult to read, I presume that many have never actually read him, basing their opinions on the opinions of others.

Whatever the case may be, that dim view is something that I have never shared.  I find, and have found, profound wisdom in his words.  A good Brother in my Jurisdiction wrote recently, "he was and remains the greatest pillar of masonic light."

So, opinions about Pike range wildly from Mason to Mason.

But that's OK.  To each his own, we certainly aren't all required to agree with each other.

For those of you who, like me, enjoy reading Pike, I'm pleased to announce that I'm starting a new project.  Starting this afternoon at 3:00PM, I am emailing anyone who desires it, and signs up for it, a very short daily quote from Brother Pike.  

It might take a few years, but together we will mine all of the jewels of wisdom from his printed works.

Ultimately I think that Pike is not read by most Freemasons for the same reason that our degree lectures (Preston/Webb in my Jurisdiction) aren't read by most Freemasons.  It is my hope that by providing a little snippet of his work, each and every day, we might study it and see if we could do well to apply it to our lives.  

You can sign up on the mailing list here:

[https://dailypike.substack.com/](https://dailypike.substack.com/)

Each daily post will contain just a short thought from Bro. Pike.  The first post will go out in a little more than six hours from now.

What are Tim's interpretations or intentions with the use of Freemasonry in cinema?
  So, in the span of two weeks, I noticed notable Masonic presence in a well-known show and movie (perhaps you're already aware).

It's not a complete secret this one, but I watched Edward Scissor Hands first ( I've seen the movie a few times before, but I wasn't a Mason yet. Edward's father/creator appears to be a masonic brother because he bears the square and compass.

The second was the show "Wednesday" and the 3rd episode in season 1 had a man wearing a shrine fez sleeping on a bench with a sheriff with two GIANT sheriff stars (honestly they almost look semitic, but anyways, you'd think one would be enough to tell the audience he's a sheriff) staring at the sleeping mason.

I could not find much information about these scenes and / or about Tim Burton himself outside of himself.

I'm just confused about why he inserts Mason men into his shows? Is it a tilt of the hat for admiration, or is it something else?

When masonry is introduced or discussed, it's always extreme conspiracy, or they respect them and know what they're about. Humor me here.

Playing a role in WM's installation!
Hi all,

&#x200B;

Been a Mason for just over a year, I'm a FC and have been asked to present the working tools in the second degree. My script isn't exactly long, probably as long as what I had to remember for my first degree, maybe even a bit shorter, but for some reason, I'm having trouble with it.

How do you all remember the scripts, feel free to share your tips! I am just nervous because I want to make it a great installation for our WM. Not to mention how some of our members deliver their scripts as if it's completely natural, it's seriously very impressive.

Been reading it out loud, but suppose I'm looking for tips to deliver it more fluently without sounding like I'm reading word-for-word.

I've delivered speeches in the past outside of Freemasonry and I've always struggled with following scripts, but can often go off and deliver it in my own way and have had no problems with this. Not sure if these have to be delivered word-for-word though, with no room for improvisation or missing out certain words?

ELI5 Templar-Mason connection?
The other day (well like 3 months ago) I went down a rabbit hole of ‚ÄúTemplar‚Äù groups - each seeming to denounce the legitimacy of the prior one, and some claiming Masonic affiliation. Do you have to be a master mason to be a real Templar?

I once interacted online with someone claiming to be a treasurer of a Masonic Templar group, but his ethics were questionable at best (contextually this was involving financial matters and his view on how to acquire profit was bad enough for me to oust him from the discussion). 

I‚Äôd simply like to hear everyone‚Äôs opinions on the Templar organizations and any hints as to which lineage(s) to research. 

Appreciate it.
Tell us about the "old days"
Couldn't help sounding like I was a kid asking grandpa, but in all sincerity, could anyone here who considers themselves an old timer (however you define that) give us a historical perspective?

Lodge Game & Movie Night Proposal Help
I'm trying to write up a proposal for some fellowship events to bring up at a future stated communication. Our lodge doesn't have any game or movie nights, but we have the space to do both at the same time. I have at least one other brother for sure willing to manage this with me. We need more events like this to just give our brothers a reason to want to hang out aside from a meeting twice a month. No one else is working on it so I'm taking the initiative.

My original plan included many games, but I've since scaled it down to just a Texas Hold 'em Poker Tournament for simplicity's sake. The idea was that one would donate to "buy into" the table and get a stack of chips. I imagined this as a freezeout tournament so the last person with chips wins. The winner would simply get their donation back as the prize and their name would go on a "Poker Champion" leaderboard just for the fun and incentive of it. The rest of the money would go 50/50 between the charity of the month and the lodge's income for that month.

For context, I've been told by brothers at my lodge that poker was brought up in the past and it was shot down by some grumpy older bros. for being immoral or some such nonsense, but I believe they were originally pitching a real dollars/quarters game where one could actually profit from winning(albeit not much). The way I would have the tournament set up, no one could technically profit from gambling. That being said, I'm not even sure if that was the issue as I wasn't there when it was brought up the first time.

The other proposal I wanted to bring up would be a movie night in our [lodge room](https://preview.redd.it/em3u5ryjg5z81.jpg?width=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=221e28cade2391def93d8ff6e9a66bdeed2f2044) to make use of our theater seating and ask for a small donation to attend. I believe this will be easier to make happen because we have everything we need to have a projector movie night there.

* Do any of you do something similar to this in your lodges?  If so, how is it set up? 
* If my idea is viable, what would a reasonable minimum donation be to buy into the table? 
* What information specifically should I put in the proposal that will be printed and passed out to the brothers during our next meeting? 
* How should I format the proposal so that I don't draw the ire of PMs?

I just don't want to waste anyone's time at the meeting when I present this so I'd like to be brief, but informative and convincing. Any advice or information would be appreciated!
'Inventing The Future' - The New Exhibition @ London's Freemasons Hall
There's an interesting new exhibition in the Museum of Freemasonry at Freemasons Hall in London which marks the tercentenary of the publication of Anderson's Constitutions. There are several first editions on display as well as a first edition of Ahiman Rezon from the 'Antients' Grand Lodge. There's also a look at the 'Old Charges' as well as the spread of Freemasonry around the world, with a couple of cabinets dedicated to Prince Hall amongst others.

Dinner charge.
So I am the current JW at my Lodge, and after watching us make little to no money on the dinner for a few years, I wanted to see what others are doing. My Lodge‚Äôs stated meeting meal went from $5 to $7 which took an act of Congress and a bunch of mumbling and grumbling from the older retired guys but alas, it was done last year. Now, inflation has really driven up food costs and we‚Äôre poised to make even less of a margin due to this. I personally sometimes throw a $20 in the bucket and would gladly pay up to $20 for a decent meal but getting the old timers who use the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on a retirement income‚Äù excuse to do anything more than $7 is so hard and the conversation is exhausting. What are you guys charging and what arguments have you presented to the Lodge to get guys to stop being so damn cheap? For the record, I know being retired is tough especially when inflation is kicking in which causes people to pull back the reigns a little, but a vast majority of these guys that are always bitching abt it have retired very well.

One of the PMs of the lodge is also the father of a woman that was a classmate of mine growing up and his wife made us brownies for afterwards, which was very sweet.

Guarding the west gate vs. gatekeeping
Lately I have seen multiple posts from non masons asking if they should join, could join, or would be a good fit. I've also seen a ton of questions about freemasonry and some posts about guarding the west gate. I understand that it is important to guard the west gate but at what point does it turn into gatekeeping? How do we encourage growth in the fraternity while keeping us on the moral path we seek?

Who is involved with the lesser known appendant bodies?
Most Masons have a solid understanding of York Rite, Scottish Ride, and the Shiners.  Who here is involved with other appendant bodies like the Sojourners or the Grotto and how do you like it?
Talking to Strangers
I suspect one of the concerns felt by both those new to and experienced with Freemasonry is the fear of walking in to a new place, and not knowing anyone.  Do I walk up and say, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù? Do I go sit over there and wait for someone to come to me? 

Or perhaps I‚Äôm just projecting my own insecurities.  It hasn‚Äôt happened for about ten days, since I visited Navy Lodge 2612 in London (as a digression, the fascinating history is here: https://www.thesquaremagazine.com/mag/article/202107navy-lodge-no-2612/)

A tip for leaders? Years ago I took a lesson from Timothy Raymond Roper Richards (TR3), Provincial Grand Master of Cheshire.  He would walk all the way up the Palace Theatre steps, where provincial Grand Lodge was held, shaking hands of those attending and welcoming them.  I began doing that back in Utah. Soon, u/JohnLiley was as well.  As GM, I tried to shake the hand of everyone in the room. Ive continued that as Almoner for my Scottish Rite Consistory.  

Does it make a difference?

The Aprons we have for stewards are mirrored; the tail of the Cornucopia faces inwards towards the JW. So the tail of the Cornucopia faces left for the Junior Steward and right for the Senior Steward.  


Because of this; some brethren have started to insinuate that proper rodwork includes facing the cornucopias on the Stewards rods the same way as well.

&#x200B;

Is this actually a thing? Are the cornucopias supposed to be oriented in a specific direction?

MM, moved to a new area... and I forgot all my signs
I was raised about 3ish years ago, but immediately after I was overseas for much of the last few years. Combined with COVID and my job, I wasn't able to attend many lodge meetings, and so while I roughly remember the basic signs of my degree, I'm very out of practice and didn't even know many Masons where I lived.

I just moved to a new area, and I'm afraid they're going to think I'm an imposter or something when I go to visit (and hopefully make it my "home away from home"). I have my dues card and all, but I really feel like I don't remember how to do some of the things. What should I do? I just want to get back into the craft.
I'm not a Mason, just a longtime lurker who's been to a couple lodges. But I thought you guys might get a kick out of reading these comments.

What are the blue and red jewels? Are they Centenary Jewels?

some say there is little esotericism in freemasonry and some say its all based on esotericism. which is true?
The legend of Hiram Abiff is obviously a mystical-esoteric allegory. Manly Hall, Albert Pike etc. all wrote volumes about the hermetic roots of freemasonry. how is it "not esoteric" in any way?
Would you be interested in a lodge program about geometric constructions using compasses?
I happen to teach geometry, so compasses are both literally and figuratively my working tools. I thought it would be kind of neat to show/remind the lodge how do use those tools in a literal sense for constructing stuff like perpendiculars or circumscribing polygons.

I know most people don‚Äôt recall math class as fondly as myself, but I think this particular topic isn‚Äôt necessarily one that gives math that reputation. But I‚Äôm throwing it out here to gauge interest before I throw the idea out to my brothers in lodge.

New to Los Angeles after graduating, wanted to learn more!
Hey guys! I just permanently moved to Los Angeles after interning out here every summer during school!

My grandfathers on both sides were heavily involved in Freemasonry, and I grew up enamored by their Freemason jewelry, pictures, etc. 

I always wanted to learn more, and I‚Äôd finally like to try! 

I interned in the film industry during school (first with a high-profile film director, then a producer, and then a big talent agency), so I‚Äôd love to find a lodge that has a lot of film interest, didn‚Äôt know if anyone had any advice? 

Thank you so much, so excited to learn more!
Converting pins to magnets
I hate stabbing my suit lapels with pins,  but as a good American Mason, I wear them. I have a ton of the proper type magnets to put on the back of pins after I strip off the pin with my dremel.   What type of glue works best?  I‚Äôd rather not soder.

What Lodge do women wear an apron like this?

Can anyone tell me what any of this means? Or if it is even freemasonry symbols? This is a picture of my great great grandpa. I thought I recognized the symbol in the middle of the apron as a Freemason symbol, I could be wrong. Any help is appreciated.

Ideas on fellowship events?
Hi all,

I‚Äôm the JW and Chairman of my Lodges Events Committee. This year, our Worshipful Master has asked that we step up our fellowship, and plan events to integrate socialization, family, and find ways to strengthen our brotherhood. He‚Äôs looking for two events per month. (minimum)

The age demographic of our lodge is primarily 50‚Äôs to 80‚Äôs, and has recently been trending downward. I myself am in my early 20‚Äôs, and find it hard to relate my hobbies with what the majority of the Lodge would enjoy. Cigar Nights have been a huge hit, and we‚Äôve planned at monthly meet at a local cigar lounge, but I‚Äôm looking for more ideas that could be inclusive to all. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

Sibelius Masonic Ritual Music
Hi All, a 1st Degree candidate here. 

I have recently been reading about masonic music (I‚Äôm an organist) and I came across Jean Sibelius‚Äô Masonic Ritual Music Op.113. 
I have found recordings and they‚Äôre really hood, but I can‚Äôt for the life of me find the sheet music. IMSLP has nothing. It seems to be very obscure. 
Do any brothers here have a copy or know of where one could be obtained?
Thank you!

Scottish rite online?

R‚à¥I‚à¥Ernest Parker, our Grand Marshal joined us tonight at the Assembly of Suffolk Council #76 Royal and Select Masters. A wonderful evening.

When is a good time to petition?
I am currently in graduate school. I petitioned around 5 years ago when I was an undergraduate and for one reason or another did not get voted through. (I was never told why but after looking back I definitely do not think I was mature enough) (I am also in a different city than where I went to undergrad so the lodge I would be petitioning for would be different).

I do have a long line of family members who are Masons, one was even the person who they called when I petitioned (my grandfather). However, I don‚Äôt converse with them about it. It‚Äôs generally not talked about.  So I haven‚Äôt asked him his opinion on the matter.

I feel like I have grown a lot since the last time I petitioned. I would like to have a community people who are focused on making themselves better and genuinely care about each other. I also feel that I am ready to take being a Freemason seriously. 

One of the things that is keeping me from looking into different lodges in the city where I am is that I may not stay here after I graduate. I am wondering how common it is for Masons to move to another lodge where they originally petitioned? Is that something that would keep me from being accepted (not sure of the terminology, so don‚Äôt mean any disrespect). 

Aside from that issue I feel that I am willing and able to put the time in that is necessary to make the most out of the membership. I am just not sure if I should wait till I am in a place I know I will be a for a good amount of time (even then I am planning on working and going back to school, most likely in another place). I want to partake in what I believe to be a valuable experience and something that can make me a better person in all areas of my life, something that I believe has benefited my family, but I also don‚Äôt know how lodges feel about members moving after they began their membership at the lodge. 

I‚Äôd appreciate everyone‚Äôs thoughts. Thank you!

Who wears is the hat
Just curious; In my jurisdiction the man of the highest position has the hat and gavel. For example when the District Deputy is his oficial capacity comes to the lodge and we are already open if he enters with his hat on ; WM after the DDGM does the stuff at the alter is to take off the hat off and pass the gavel and the same if the DDGM where in the east and the Grand Master where to walk in. How is it where you are from?

Philosophical Will
Whats the best way to describe to a candidate what a Philosophical Will is, while in the COR. Someone ppl assuming its a material will, less‚Ä¶.esoteric/philosophical inclined candidates sometimes do not gasp the concept. Any tips?
what about non-binary candidates?
So I was reading on it a bit and it seems that freemasons can be pretty trans-friendly, like if transwomen joined and transitioned after, they're still good, and transmen can join. Seems way more progressive than I'd think in a "brotherhood", won't kick out transwomen and will accept transmen.

But what if you're non-binary, or genderfluid? I might walk in and be seen as male, but if they decided to ask me I'd say no, I identify as non-binary. Not sure how they'd feel about that. I'm not a woman, but I'd prefer they/them and would rather people not to refer to me as a man. If it's a brotherhood then sure, I might be fine with being called a brother. I wouldn't fuss. But I'd rather not be seen as male.

I was wondering if this ever came up, whether there was transphobia, or whether they were outright denied.

It seems like it's focused on people who want to make the world better in some ways, about belief that there is more to the world than *you*, that there's a higher power. I love those ideals, I'm just interested if it really comes down to that in practice and how that plays out. Or does it just feel like a club with a secret handshake with a bunch of older men.
Watches and rings

Masons with a Mind/Body practice
Would love to DM with any Brothers that have mind/body practices (meditation, breath work, cold immersion, etc). Freemasonry and these practices are obviously separate things, but would love to converse with anyone that has found ways to have these things compliment each other.
Wearing a PM apron as the sitting Master.
What do you guys thing about wearing a PM apron as the sitting master. I am heading into a second year as master and last meeting I was presented with a PM apron and my PM jewel, and I‚Äôm trying to decide if I should wear it or just go with the masters apron. ( For context My line officers who are PMs do not wear the apron of their station, rather I‚Äôve always seen them wear a PM or GL apron)
Anybody like watches?

How to sabotage an organization from the inside
I found this on another sub, and my immediate thought was I've seen a lot of these behaviors before...

In 1944, The OSS wrote a handbook instructing operatives on how to sabotage organizations from the inside. Here were their recommendations:

(1) Insist on doing everything through ‚Äúchannels.‚Äù Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.

(2) Make ‚Äúspeeches.‚Äù Talk as frequently as possible and at great length.

(3) When possible, refer all matters to committees, for ‚Äúfurther study and consideration.‚Äù Attempt to make the committees as large as possible‚Äînever less than five.

(4) Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.

(5) Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.

(6) Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.

(7) Demand written orders.

(8) ‚ÄúMisunderstand‚Äù orders. Ask endless questions or engage in long correspondence about such orders. Quibble over them when you can.

(9) Do everything possible to delay the delivery of orders. Even though parts of an order may be ready beforehand, don‚Äôt deliver it until it is completely ready.

(10) In making work assignments, always sign out the unimportant jobs first.

(11) Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those which have the least flaw. Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.

(12) When training new workers, give incomplete or misleading instructions.

(13) To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions. Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.

(14) Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.

(15) Multiply paper work in plausible ways.

(16) Start duplicate files.

(17) Multiply the procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on. See that three people have to approve everything where one would do.

(18) Apply all regulations to the last letter.

(19) Do your work poorly and blame it on bad tools, machinery, or equipment. Complain that these things are preventing you from doing your job right.

(20) Never pass on your skill and experience to a new or less skillful worker.

(21) Snarl up administration in every possible way. Fill out forms illegibly so that they will have to be done over; make mistakes or omit requested information in forms.

(22) Give lengthy and incomprehensible explanations when questioned.

(23) Act stupid.

(24) Be as irritable and quarrelsome as possible without getting yourself into trouble.

(25) Misunderstand all sorts of regulations concerning such matters as rationing, transportation, traffic regulations.

Do any of these behaviors look familiar?
Being high on Freemasonry.
Have you ever not really felt like going to lodge but kick yourself to shower, begrudgingly put on your suit, grab your apron, and head out to lodge and end up having an awesome night with your brothers? I was tired at the end of the day and was feeling meh about visiting a lodge with an EA to get his 1st degree lecture. Seeing him absorb the lecture and really enjoying visiting another lodge reminded me why I love being a mason and filled me with the urge to mentor this guy. I left feeling uplifted and ¬´¬†high on masonry.¬†¬ª Just like I feel every time I leave lodge. That‚Äôs why I try to never miss it despite how I feel that day.
Masonry in popular art?
Has anyone come across any Masonic References or symbolism in modern art or pop culture? It seems like it was more common in previous generations...but maybe it's happening now and I'm just not hip to it.

Visitation Advice - UGLE visiting GLNF Rite √âcossais Ancien et Accept√©
Looking for some advice regarding regalia. I will be visiting France soon and have arranged to visit a GLNF Rite √âcossais Ancien et Accept√© Lodge, but have struggled to get a good answer from any secretary or Brother. The language barrier has made it slightly more difficult. This is the only reason I'm reaching out to the Brethren on Reddit.

I am a MM under UGLE, but I am also an 18¬∞ in the Rose Croix (Ancient and Accepted Rite of England or Scottish Rite).

In France, Craft Lodges fall under various rites rather than there being separate orders. The Lodge I will be visiting practices the Ancient and Accepted Rite. 

As I am a member of said order in England, would I wear my normal craft regalia or should I wear my 18¬∞ Ancient and Accepted Rite collar?

I intended to bring clearance certificates as well as my Grand certificates from both, and the Lodge does confer up to the 33¬∞.

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide!

Any PM's Take a Sabattical After Handing Over the Gavel?
Hey all I just want to see if it's just me. I'm starting to understand why as I went through the chairs I noticed that most of our PM's became scarce after their year. Since turning over the lodge to our current and very well qualified WM I will admit it's been nice to not *have to* go to lodge and just enjoy an evening with my wife or take care of other things I'd like to. But part of me still feels obligated to go to lodge even though I know I'm not. I guess being required to be at every meeting for half a decade has its effects. Any other PM's sort of take a step back for a few months?
[UGLE] Recommendations for music books for the lodge and festive board?
Evening Brethren, 

I've been accompanying songs at my lodge's festive boards but the piano music I've been working from is either poor quality photocopies of old sheet music or my (equally poor!) arrangements. I've been trying to find a 'masonic standard' book containing music for the lodge and festive board. Ideally, I'd like something that contains piano accompaniments for the Entered Apprentice Song and the Master's Song (the 'here's to his health in a song' one), plus some example organ music for the temple (for if I'm appointed organist after being in the chair). Does such a thing exist? I'm struggling to find anything that is a definitive volume containing all this - everything seems to be individual sheet music unfortunately.

My lodge is based on Northern England in case this is important.

Is it worth it to stay?
So I was raised last year as a Master Mason, and within six months, I wound up walking away from my home lodge.  I got tired of one of the brothers being a massive homophobe(if I wanted to be called f\*ggot once a week, I'd still be playing shows with edgelord punk bands), and the other brothers around him shielding him from consequences for his behavior.  When he decided that electioneering at the lodge was acceptable behavior(he was running for public office and trying to tell folks "well gotta vote for me, gotta support a BROTHER!"), and I told him to step off with his nonsense, and one of his friends threatened to bring me up on Masonic charges for objecting to it, because "well what did you tell his opponent about him huh huh huh?" (I don't know his opponent), I just walked away.  Stepped out of the officer line, tried to talk to the WM(he shook his finger at the guy and otherwise did nothing), and the DDGM about things after that, and got nowhere.  

One of the older members of that Lodge, a member of my church and an all-around good guy, is trying to get me to come back, but I'm just done.  I'm ready to sign demit paperwork, and the only thing that stops me is that I know it'll be a pain in the ass to keep my membership current if I don't have a home lodge that I pay dues to.  Trying to decide if it's worth continuing to pay dues to this lodge while I try and find another one.

Plaque for former lodge
Good Day Brethren,

We recently sold our lodge building in our local town due to our BL having to close. While unfortunate, purchaser was willing to put a plaque on the building in order to honor some of the history of the lodge as part of the sale as the lodge has been a part of the community for some time. What kinds of things would be meaningful to put on such a plaque for any future individuals who may see it that would honor freemasonry and our lodge as a whole and what it did for the community?

Thank you in advance for any input!

What happens if you lose your belief?
I know I can‚Äôt join the Freemasons as I‚Äôm an atheist and one of the rules is you need to have a belief in a higher power.

When I was younger in my early 20s I was agnostic I believed in a god as creating the universe but other than that not intervening.  Also around that time I started to hear about Freemasons although most of it may have been false as it was media and conspiracy news sources that would talk about them but in a negative light.

As time went on my grandmother from my fathers side got older and when we were in the process of helping her move to a retirement home we found a few items of my grandpa she still had that were from his time in the free masons.  I wasn‚Äôt aware of it as he passed away before I was born.

Around that time my grandmother from my mothers side had passed away and during the visitations one of the days we had a bunch of members of the masons come to see her.  My grandmother was a higher ranking member of the women‚Äôs group of the lodge. I think it‚Äôs eastern star.  I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm forgetting the exact names as it‚Äôs been over 20 years.  
I also found out around that time as well that my grandfather on my mothers side was a Freemason. 

Now they have all passed on but I found out they could have helped me if I wanted to become a mason.  Also at that time as I stated I did have a belief in a higher power.  But as I got closer to my 30s I lost that belief.  I‚Äôm just curious as to what happens if any members of the masons lose their belief?  Are they kicked out, or do they do like some religions that have some people still doing the traditions because they enjoy it despite their lack faith?

Question before my initiation.
Preface, I‚Äôm not yet entered apprentice. Please let me know if you recommend I rephrase the below.  

I‚Äôve been asked to help organise a dinner meet with my soon to be brethren, my initiation will be in March. It‚Äôs been suggested for me to think of a restaurant to meet members of the lodge at along with our partners to get to know each other. 

I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm expected to pay for this?, Is it rude of me to ask the secretary I am liaising with. I don‚Äôt yet know the customs or etiquette of dining with brethren. 

Would anyone be able to let me know what their experience is with this kind of thing.

Thanks in advance any advice welcome.

plain text = not secret?
Kinda weird but my wife has been fascinated by Masonry and is always asking me questions. I don't mind sharing the meanings behind things and talking about stuff not covered in my obligation. 

My Masonic Monitor is in plain text and I've been asked to give the long form staircase lecture which is in plain English. My Wife has asked if she can actually listen to this since it's in plain English. 

My lodge says they guess it's not ciphered so it's not secret and my GL laws don't mention anything about lectures or monitors being included in the obligations. 

What would you guys say?

Edit: I know this is extremely jurisdictional. More just interested in what other jurisdictions say than a guidance question.

Demolay should deassociate its self with the Freemasons: Unpopular Opinion
For a number of years now the freemasons have sponsored a number of boy scout, girl scout and community organizations without putting a label on them that makes outsiders belive they are part of the freemasons or a family of masonic organizations so why should the freemasons lable demolay apart of the masonic organization?????

Demolay is a youth group sponsored by the freemasons similar to the boy scouts and any other youth group associated with a high school or middle school campus and the age requirements are twelve years to twenty one years of age.

Demolay consists of team building character building and kids having a fun time playing video games and sports, demolay also has numerous masonic organizations that have created scholarships and grants for kids who are part of demolay to go to college.

However in my opinion demolay should move away from being sponsored by the freemasons and being sponsored by religious institutions, schools, and local businesses around the community, let's face it freemasonry is a dying organization there are only a handful of lodges and chapters left in the whole United States lodges are merging every year and shuttering there doors, lodges have a problem bringing in young people because the generational gaps between the different members within the organization ots self.

Demolay relies on the freemasons to look for new members to join or any advisors a chapter might need to bring in to be supervisors or role models for the teens, I personally think demolay should ditch that idea and send out pamphlets, broushures and mailers to local families in there communities they could ask co workers, freinds, family members, teachers if they could lend a hand in a role being advisors, chapter mentors and sponsors, ask around don't recruit new boys in by asking around different lodges in the area cause tbh alot of the members in lodge don't have family anymore that have kids around that age group even there grandchildren have aged out of demolay.

So why does demolay try to recruit asking around members from different lodges, that can't relate to them anymore there's a generational gap between lodge members and adult advisors as well because most lodge members as of 2023 are over the age of 65+ my chapter dad was in his 30s and was the youngest member of his lodge he could not relate to older men on how to recruit new demolay boys because they didn't have any young family's anymore and there grandchildren and there grandchildren kids were all grown up or they asked extended family and the ability to gain new members failed because loss of interest.

When I was in high school I asked around to different people in my age group if they wanted to join demolay and there exact response was what's that????

When I showed them pictures from local demolay events around my local area they laughed and shrugged it off they called it a cult and told me if we worshipped goats but the biggest response was "IS IT A PART OF THE FREEMASONS" 

And my response was "NO"

It's no secret that demolay is based on freemasonry however it's not actually apart of the original masonic Bodie but a sponsored organization that has masonic teachings and I would like to change the way people think about demolay of I could.

When you do a quick search on Google images you get pictures and images of demolay boys in robes, kneeling at an alter with an open bible(something not many pepole have there kids are raised on these days) you also get alot of images that look like boys are going to meet someone as if it's the night of there senior ball or prom personally I don't think kids these days want to belong to an organization that forces kids to dress up, wear robes and give flower talks kids want video games, sports and hanging out with freinds I think demolay should move away from this masonic teachings and more towards being like something kids would do after school like skills usa.

Demolay is a big let down for kids who wearnt very religious to begin with so making them open an Bible wear robes and dress up makes them uninterested or bored within the organization I would like to change that by ways of modernization and doing away with the masonic sponsored organization that just happens to meet in a masonic hall I want to meet somewhere exciting or fun like a high school gym or trampoline park demolay as a youth organization os very outdated chapters within demolay are closing down because boys are seeming less interested in religion and dressing up and more towards social media and video games.

I want an organization that's catered to social media sports video games and hanging out with freinds I don't want to read some ritual that's 100 years old and kids don't either I want demolay to Ditch the meeting st the masonic temple thing because its a big turn off kids don't want to meet In old run down buildings they can even meet on socal media sites like Skype and teams and do team building exercises from there.

When I was in demolay convention consisted of boring meetings and seminars on usless things like how to dress up and talk to people I want convention to be fun have a comic con or a sports convention  ask a college athlete to come talk to kids on self image and eating right but when I was in demolay it was installation after installation  with a fancy dinner with the other youth organizations I want demolay to be fun have a beauty pagent or socal media contest dress like your favorite Disney chsrecter.

For years when I was in demolay ot was all about past state sweethearts and state Master consoliers at convention they would give talks about how to bring people in to demolay but there would be 10 year age gaps between the youth and the past state master councilors. But winterfest that was fun we would go to a ski lodge and go to a hotel that was the highlight each year demolay needs to be fun not masonic related or sponsored it needs to be packed full of kids and advisors if you can't find boys ask girls merge all of the youth groups into one demolay needs the numbers!!!!

It's time for demolay to change for the better and grow its a new year there's no doubt demolay needs numbers to grow with in the organization for it to be successful so ditch the masonic sponsored organization or masonic affiliated.

Also make special needs chapters or chapters for kids who are battling depression or a major loss in there life, they need demolay the most.

it will be very important in the long run for them and there self esteem and identity of how they feel as a person will change.

 The way demolay is being ran as a whole right now it's looking like the junior Masons and not a normal run youth group like the boy scouts or a club kids might go too after school.

 kids thses days need fun Especially since the pandemic restricted kids to home life only and took away from there childhood memories and the ability to connect with other people and see there freinds as well as missing out on social events and school activities like sports.

I think the freemasons shouldn't have to cater to demolay as well because there two separate organizations plus alot of the older members can't relate to demolay members or advisors so they don't bother participating in any if demolay functions or events except for donating a few extra dollars they might have to try and be supportive for the kids.

When I was in demolay it seemed like a lot of members of the masonic organizations looked down on the youth groups like demolay and rainbow and brushed them off like they were nothing and demolay being called a member of the masonic family was unimportant and unrelatible and thought of demolay like annother church youth group that meet at the masonic temple.

I want to change that I want people to know demolay can be something more without the masonic or cult like  stigma associated with it, as well as the idea that the only way demolay survives is off of funds and donations that the masonic bodies donate too.

Demolay can be more than a masonic youth group it can be a youth group that grows because kids want to join it because they think it's fun or exciting not an youth group that meets at the masonic temple that all of the members grand and great children belong too 

demolay can be something more let's keep it that way !!!!!

NYC lodge recommendations?
I‚Äôm a brother, recently moved to Westchester but usually come into the city, so I‚Äôd like to check out some Manhattan lodges and eventually maybe affiliate.  I‚Äôm early 30s, Married, work as a management consultant, prefer more formal and cosmopolitan style lodges. Any tips?

What fundraisers have worked for your lodge?

On Wednesday my girlfriend and I will be visiting the local lodge for dinner. My intention is to network and show my character to the members present. Due to me having felonies I will need to work extra hard before requesting initiation. I want them to see me often and get to know my true character first hand. Wish me luck!

Norway or Nordics
Hey there masons, is there any masons from Norway or the north here?
Still no progress.
Hello everyone.
Some of you may remember a month or so back I was having problems with joining a lodge.
I'd been put in contact with a local lodge by the Provincial Lodge and all seemed well when I spoke to the secretary.
Now nearly 2 months have gone by and no word from the secretary.
I even wished him a HNY but that was ignored.
I've been in contact with PL and they chased things and they were told that I'd be contacted shortly as the Secretary was busy.
That was a week ago, so still no further forward.
I hate to ask but is this behaviour normal?
It takes seconds to send a simple text message for an update and I'm starting to feel I'm not worth that to this lodge (guess I'm also bugged by the NY thing).
Advise would be nice
Feeling frustrated with the application process
Hey brothers, I inquired for information with my local lodge with almost no information of freemasonry last spring. I attended a few meetings and dinner and got to know the guys and their families. I am neurodivergent (dyslexic and on the autism spectrum, but feel I am getting along well with everyone, despite my anxiety. 
In the fall I applied for the lodge as an applicant, along with others and did my initial interview, references, gave my check and background check. The worshipful master is new and doing a good job, but nothing is moving forward, with myself or other applicants. I gave my references in September or October and none have been called. It is awkward for me to go to meetings with people who are showing up as potential occupants, while all the brothers do the meeting. 
I know I‚Äôm not entitled to anything from anyone, but want to know where I stand. As someone with disabilities I‚Äôve been disclosed on and off most of my life and feel a sense of belonging here. 
Everything was moving so fast and now nothing. I‚Äôm still participating when I can, but I guess I just want to be one of the guys. I never have been before.
The other applicants have come up to me and asked what‚Äôs going on as I‚Äôve been ab applicant longer. They‚Äôve indicated frustration in the process.  I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôll never be selected and just on the sides lines. Any advice is appreciated. I‚Äôm in Massachusetts if that matters.
New EA - Looking for advice
Greetings Brothers,  
I was made an EA a couple months back and have been struggling to make significant progress on the proficiency I was tasked with. Most days are busy with work followed by transporting my kids back and forth to their sports and after school activities as well as other household duties - leaving my "free" time very fragmented. I am wondering what tips/tricks you might have to aid in memorization? I have obviously asked some Brothers from my lodge but everyone has a different approach and I am curious what you have found most helpful?  


Thank You !
Joined the Shrine today!!

Artificial Intelligence
I'm really curious and interested to know what you brothers think of artifical intelligence, the singularity of the AI and whats happening now with the rapid advancement of technology?
Interested but not religious
I have done a little reading into free masonry and I am interested however there is one thing that is holding me back. One prerequisite I have seen (in most lodges) is a belief in a supreme being. I'm not religious by any means and am an agonistic, I accept the possibility but claim no knowledge or belief of a "God", would that count or nah?

Is there hazing (physical harm) in freemasonry in the Philippines?
I‚Äôm interested to join particularly here in Las Pi√±as. I would like to know particularly from Philippine members if hazing, which means using physical harm such as paddling, beating up, etc. is part of the initiation?
Affairs and Masons
My husband is a Free Mason and a former Worshipful Master.  
He also has carried on an affair for over a year. It is now over.  He used Masons to cover up parts of the affair.  He lied to myself and our children and his fellow Masons during this time.  He is a better man than this, so I forgive him.
But it saddens me because he told me that Free Masons are about being the best man he can be, but his behaviors have worsened since joining.   I am not saying it is because of Masons,  but a coincidence. 
I want to get my husband on a better track.  I thought Masons might be the way.  I do not want to hurt his reputation, so I will not speak of his affair to his brothers, but want him to do better.  Any suggestions.  A message,  perhaps,  I could share with him?
Without violating any secrets, of course. 
I thought about asking my brother,  but I do not want him to know of my husband's mistake. 
Thank you.

Share a photo of an ancestor who was a Freemasons!
Seeing a few old photos here reminded me of one of my ancestors, Shadrach Roundy. He was made a master mason in the 1840s in Illinois. He went to be one of the first pioneers to settle in Utah. He's one of my heroes and an inspiration to me on my journey. 

Do you have an ancestor who was a Mason that inspires you?

research help masonic re-obligations
I can't find a link or article on the history of reobligation ceremonies anywhere with all the BS going around on the internet and i want to do it as a topic on Thursday for masonic education for my lodge since we're gonna be doing a re-obligation ceremony.
Seeking advice,
I'm an EA at the local lodge. However, it seems to me that I'm not all that welcomed there. The lodge is made up mainly of family members, which I have no ties to. Trying to obtain time for coaching seems to be a problem, I was not assigned a designated coach. During the interviews I was told that this lodge does things a little different. All lodge meeting are for MM, never had an open lodge for EA or FC
My question is. Should I just suck it up and move forward, or find myself a different lodge and petition again?
Initiation & Dues

Looking for some recommended reading about the history and philosophy behind masonry.
Also not looking for something that will spoil the rituals and ceremonies involved. I want my experience with this to be completely authentic. I don't want any preconceived notions about what I should expect but also want to learn more about where it all comes from. 

Any help would be appreciated.

Concept of "Third Place" and Lodge.

I was struck by the comment in the above linked thread that describes the concept of the "third place" and how they are disappearing in their true form in the US. The concept really resonated with me as I feel as if the Lodge does for me today. 

Do yall think lodge filled that "third place" in the past? How do we get back to this today?

I would like to come back
I was a MM 12 years ago. I then went through a horrible financial issue and was too embarrassed to talk to my lodge, so I stopped payingy dues. I would like to get back to masonry. I've missed it for years but have let my embarrassment prevent me from going back.

First off, is it possible to get back in good graces? 

Secondly, how would I go about starting that process?

Thank you.

I see answers that skirt around what we can and cannot discuss with the public but I would imagine that not everyone is equally careful. I'm just concerned at the number of very focused questions that we get, it's almost as though someone is collecting information from the outside.  Maybe I'm just paranoid?

Choosing a lodge in Edmonton
Good day folks,

I‚Äôm looking into joining a lodge in Edmonton. Despite the research I have done I find choosing a specific lodge to be a daunting task. 

There are a number of lodges available to me and I really don‚Äôt know how to choose amongst them. Can anyone in Edmonton provide some guidance. 

What considerations are involved in choosing a lodge?
Humor Repost: Fellowship of Enthusiastic Masonry
It has been a long week and I need a laugh. Recycling a post I made a few years ago and being offered ironically, I think we solve membership and participation problems by embracing pop-culture inspired degrees, e.g.:

* The Star Trek Mason Degree;
* The Jedi Knight Mason Degree;
* The Broney Degree;;
* Pythonic Masonry ‚Äì consisting of three degrees
   * Sacred Ministry of Silly Walks
   * Lumberjack Degree
   * Dead Parrot Degree
* The Order of Whedon/Order of Sorkin (beautiful degrees, lectures are long and hard to memorize);
* The Merry Marvel Marching Mason Degree;
* The Royal Imp Degree (You drink and you know things, just remember to pay your debts);
* The LEGO Master Builder degree;
* The Cask of Aficionado;
* The Order of Sam Beckett (You just keep bouncing from position to position, the word order just gets swiss-cheesed in your brain, works either for Quantum Leap or for Waiting for Godot fans);
* The Gotham Rite (No aprons, just utility belts);
* Inquisitive Order of the Tinfoil Hat (all conspiracies, all the time);
* The Order of the Trident (Just like Eastern Star, just pirate and mermaid themed);
* The Lovecraft Degree (best experienced if everyone just keeps their eyes closed, refuses to gain any knowledge and burns all strange books)  
  

We need more, an entire curriculum, organized in a new appendant body called the Fellowship of Enthusiastic Masonry. I tell ya, we market this right, put out the right merchandise and supplemental materials and ain't none of our kids paying for college.
Greetings All
Hello everyone, I'm somewhat new to reddit and certainly new to this sub.    
Thought I'd mention I'm in the WA GL jurisdiction and excited to link up with Brothers.
What do you do for Open House?
Greetings Brethren.

My jurisdiction has an event each year where all the lodges in a district put on some kind of event in order to invite the public into our lodges. The underlying goals of this is to form connections in our respective communities and educate prospective candidates on paths to membership. We have a lot of freedom when it comes to the types of events we can put on. Any thing from classic car shows to pan cake breakfasts.

I'm curious what types of events your lodge may of had success with in the past. This could mean it was well attended, or resulted in at least one candidate application, or any measurable increase of awareness of your lodge in your community.

Thanks for your time.
As JD tonight this was what I heard behind my left shoulder from the SW

Imma do it (oh he is?!)
Going to email my local lodge today about joining, am a bit nervous to be honest with ya guys. Any one have any pointers? Should I just get straight to the point with wanting to join? Should I mention a place to meet up? Like a local pizza joint/bar? Hell, Dunkin donuts? 

Any and all input will be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks for your time!

Fraternity
Morning Brethren,

I am a member of a lodge here in the UK, under UGLE jurisdiction. 

Recently I have been through a pretty traumatic time with the birth of my first child (a boy) who arrived just over 11 weeks early via an emergency C section. As you can imagine it was a rough time for my wife and son, we well as myself.

He was born just before the Masonic season began so I decided to contact the WM, explain the situation and step down from my upcoming appointment in the lodge as we were due to spend a lot more time in the hospital until my son was fit enough to be discharged. Thankfully he‚Äôs home now and doing amazing!

I have to say, I never heard back from the WM or any other lodge member for at least 6 weeks. This certainty left me feeling very disappointed from the lack of fraternity and support. Am I expecting too much from the lodge? I almost feel reluctant to return to the lodge because of how disappointed I feel.

Appreciate any advice guidance you can offer,


Regards S&F
Some of you will find this amusing.

What do our brethren most desire from their experience?
Masonry is always evolving, however slowly. We're at a time when masonry is starting to grow and evolve at the same time. The Grand Lodge wants to know what our brothers most desire from their experience and this seems a good forum to put up a vote. Feel free to add comments for different items not added here and we can rerun the poll soon.

Masonic Interpretation of Ghost's Square Hammer

A proper definition for TGAOTU
BACKGROUND: Not a mason

I've been scrolling through posts on this subreddit looking for what qualifies as a definition of God, in Freemasonry. I haven't found an answer that can sufficiently address my concern. If I join a lodge knowing that what I believe does not qualify as a belief in God; then I'm wasting my time, the time of those in the lodge, and I'm lying to everyone involved. I would like to avoid placing myself in such a useless situation.

I have no religion but I do believe in something eternal and all-encompassing beyond what human senses could possibly observe. But I don't know if it can be described as being "concerned" with human affairs or if it can be described as a single being. Perhaps I see it more as the all-powerful force that drives everything. It's a bit of a vague definition but describing this belief I have is not an easy task for me. I don't expect all of you to have the same opinion concerning my situation but I would appreciate your thoughts on the matter. What counts as a belief in God that is suitable in Masonry?
First person to ask about Freemasonry- how‚Äôd I do?
I was raised in July, and started wearing a Masonic ring on my pinky. 

While buying coffee today, the clerk asked me how long I‚Äôd been in. I told him roughly a year, followed by a ‚Äú‚Ä¶soooo?‚Äù He answered no, but he was curious.
I told him our local Lodge was not two miles from here, and if ever had any questions he could stop in or give us a call.

He had a few questions- mainly, what are the benefits? ‚ÄúBrotherhood, camaraderie, charity, free food‚Äù. I told him we host open game nights and luncheons open to the public. 
He asked if our food is primarily Ham and Beans- ‚ÄúNah, we have pizza and cater out and stuff too‚Äù.

He asked if he‚Äôs obligated to attend meetings- ‚ÄúNo, in fact there‚Äôs a few people who have joined that we haven‚Äôt seen in years.‚Äù

I told him I was one of the younger members and many of the older Brothers were in need of younger men to petition.
‚ÄúBut, I‚Äôm not asking you to join. Just if you have any questions, reach out to us.‚Äù

I‚Äôve never been 100% on what I can and can‚Äôt do when someone asks about Masonry, so I err on the side of caution. Anything I could have said or done differently?

Question About Leaving/Suspending Membership
I have paid my dues to my hometown lodge for 10 years, but I haven‚Äôt lived in my hometown for 9 years. The lodge does not take electronic payment for dues, and I haven‚Äôt been back to pay in cash since the pandemic. Since I missed my dues payment by 2 years my lodge has threatened to send me to collections even though I‚Äôve always paid on time prior to the pandemic. I will be home to pay my dues and get caught up shortly, but the entire experience has me wanting to switch lodges. However, I‚Äôll be moving out of the country in a few months and it doesn‚Äôt make sense to switch lodges at this time. Is there a way to abandon one lodge without having another lined up or is my only option to resign from masonry entirely?

Masonic Sites In Ireland?
Greetings Brethern,

  The wife and I are vacationing from Minnesota to Ireland for ten days in March of 2023 (13 March to 23 March to be exact).  I'm a Master Mason from Minneapolis and am wondering about must-see Masonic sites on our journey.  Given I'll have the wife in tow, I'm less curious about stated meetings on the trip but instead some eye candy / open Lodges / old tombs / etc as we move from Dublin down the western coast to Cork and back.  Any and all suggestions are appreciated!  We're both excited to go and my lovely gal is nearly as excited as I am to visit some old haunts of The Craft.  Happy New Year to you all.
Any Brothers in Ohio that Hunt?
I‚Äôm in Central Ohio but definitely willing to travel. Looking for someone that hunts and willing to teach a guy with common sense. Availability during the week days is a plus!
join us

Are you a traveling man?
What's the G in the middle of the compass and ruler mean? Does the star with 5 different colors mean you're a female? Why doesn't the lodging I've seen have windows? Why do you have to pay dues? Is Free Masonary satanic? How long does it take to be a 33rd degree? Just some questions that I had based on my experiences. Not being judgemental
Hesitance in joining
I have been curious about joining the craft for a long time. I have read/listened to various esoteric/occult/hermetic/philosophical authors like Manly P Hall, Albert Pike, Alan Watts, Terence McKenna, Aleister Crowley and so on, I have visited a grand lodge and took museum tours and I admire both the literal masonry & ornamentation of the building, and the principles of trying to make good men better, refining the crude matter etc, and that the craft teaches through allegorical ritual dramas. I have so many questions
Side Degrees
Do any of your Lodges perform fun and educational side Degrees as fundraisers?  We have a number here in Washington, but I've always been curious if they are done in other Jurisdictions as well.

Through the years, I've received three.  The Rail Road Degree, given by Skykomish Lodge, in which I was extremely impressed at how Rail Road tools were given moral symbolism.  The Cowboy Degree by Naches Lodge, probably the most fun I've ever had in a Lodge.  And the Logger Degree by Forks Lodge, an event that combined quality Masonic education with a very fun environment.

Are we unique with these in Washington, or are such things done everywhere?
Bought an [Electronic] Copy of Mackey's The Symbolism of Freemasonry....
And [this schlock](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Masonry_(Freemasonry)) is in the front of it. If you want an aneurism, give it a read.

It's Hermann Gruber's entry on Freemasonry from the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913). I'm aggravated because it's in all three Mackey books I purchased from the publisher. I only paid a dollar a book but I hate that I gave them anything at this point....

EDIT: The publisher is Jazzybee Verlag

Atlanta-area Masons, where you at?
I‚Äôm going to be traveling to the ATL from Oregon in a couple months and would love to sit in Lodge with some brothers while I‚Äôm there. I‚Äôm originally from there (going back to visit family) but haven‚Äôt been back since being raised a few years ago (right before Covid).

I‚Äôll be in the metro area the last week of March‚Ä¶ what suggestions do you have for this Traveling Man?
Ways to get involved in the community?
Howdy y‚Äôall. I‚Äôve recently joined a lodge in my new city after just kind of drifting pre covid. One thing that really gets to me is helping others. Not only are we supposed to work to improve ourselves as masons, but we should strive to improve our communities. My lodge is active, albeit a little older, but it seems we don‚Äôt do much for the community. We sponsor some local kids sports teams, adopted the street in front of the lodge, and paid for a family‚Äôs Thanksgiving dinner. These are great, but I want to do more. I already run my company‚Äôs ‚Äúcorporate social responsibility‚Äù committee so I have some ideas that I could borrow such as working at a soup kitchen, a monthly donation box for food or clothes, or shopping for children that may not have supplies or toys. But I want to hear from the brothers. What are some ideas I could pitch to get these guys more involved?

Masonic Artifacts Found
I am a 32nd Degree Mason and Shriner. I am the first Mason since my great grandfather, who passed away when I was months old. I found out he was a Mason prior to my initiation. However, my mom recently moved houses (she lived in her mom's house, my great-grandfather's daughter), and found a few of his Masonic things. She gave them to me. I recognized a few of their importance's, however, there is a small leather case that I am unsure of. The case's specifications are as follows:

\-Light Brown

\-Gold Square and Compass on the front

\-Has a zipper

\-Roughly 3inches wide by 3.75 inches tall

Inside the case were three vials. One appears to be empty; one is full of this yellowish liquid ( I do not dare to open it); and the final one looks like dried blood. I think he was a member of a lodge in post-war Germany where he was stationed if that helps.

Does something like this sound familiar to anyone? Does anyone have any further info on it?
Freemasonry necklace
My brother was given a"G" necklace by an "acquaintance", which has then passed onto my sister as he had no idea what it was and wasn't interested in it or wearing it.
Upon further research, it appears to be a freemason necklace.....does being given this have any significance? Should we even have this? Any advice is welcome.
Thankyou in advance.
Felonious Freemason
I have been studying Freemasonry for years but have not yet joined. I have done prison time and during this time I changed my mind in extraordinary ways. Started studying Freemasonry and the Occult. Recreated who I was. Now I‚Äôm wondering the various opinions on felons seeking membership. I have heard a few people tell me they will judge you based on whether or not you‚Äôve reformed yourself. What is your opinion?
as a curious outsider what do you actually do/believe?
because i see lots of things calling you devil worshippers and satanists but then other places say you're christian's and i just wonder in the middle of this what the truth is.
thanks
Invitational bodies
Just curious if we can get a list of invitational bodies, ‚Äúwhat they do‚Äù (what is their goals/purpose?), and where are they mostly located (geographically).

I‚Äôm not seeking any invitations.
The next generations
Though not being a mason, i assume that the fraternity doesn't easily change its ways, yet grows from where it has come from into something different than before. True evolution.
So, to those who are members: when you become the next elders what is it that you may want to put an emphasis on that maybe wasn't as focused on in your lodge when you were first a member? As a custodian of the fraternity what do you believe deserves more attention?
mystic and mirrors
There is an inherent mystique that hangs over the fraternity that can be the allure that attracts individuals to it. Though, i am not a brother of your fraternity, i too understand that things of this nature can be a let down once you are on the other side of the fence. Have any members felt an underwhelming feeling after joining?

I assume it must be common for people to join for the mystic and stay for the brotherhood and betterment of ones self.
Questions on traditional longevity
So, i am not a mason and I've been researching and wondering about how you handle or deal with the focus of individual masons. 

Have those who have been a part of the fraternity noticed any difficulty with member numbers? Or possibly the slow death of attendance?
I once watched a podcast of masons talking about how the repetition of the traditions you guys partake in can become mundane for some members.
Do you often find yourselves dealing with members who have lost interest or have put their attention into others things?

And to add, has the growth of technology and social media competing for everyones attention made member count go up or down?
Labor to Refreshment vs. At Ease
Brothers,

I am a relatively new MM and was recently elected JW and when studying my lines for labor to refreshment it was noted that the lodge could also be put ‚Äúat ease‚Äù with a rap of the gavel by the WM but that it should ‚Äúnot be a replacement for labor to refreshment.‚Äù

I have only ever seen my lodge here in Colorado ever go to refreshment during the third degree, every other time we are put at ease. A brother even recently asked during a meeting why we never go to refreshment and no one really had a good answer as to why or the difference between the two. As I noted above our ritual book alludes to a difference but offers no further explanation.

Could anyone help me understand the difference?

Thanks
Old brooch question. Is this brooch related to the Freemasons and if so what is the meaning of this variant?

No callback
On the masonic website beafreemason.org I've requested to be contacted but have never been contacted. I put my first request in over a year ago and then another one a month ago. Should I just go directly to my local lodge website? My closest lodge is 45 minutes away. Could this be the reason for them not reaching out to me?

How soon to the Sword?
So I just found out that a relative was a Templar Knight. I got to hold his really cool sword. 

Here‚Äôs my question: 

What‚Äôs the soonest I can hold a position that allows me to have a sword? (This is not the primary reason I‚Äôm becoming a Freemason, but I‚Äôd be lying if I didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs an awesome reason)!

Education...
Firstly, I want to wish every brother across the world, on reddit or not, a very happy new year! 

Now then, I was wondering if anyone had any reading suggestions specifically related to Irish Freemasonry? 
Obviously not the rituals etc but just reading around the topic in general if that makes sense? 

I've seen many suggestions for reading material and was wondering if any of what has been suggested would lean towards Irish  Freemasonry?

Info on Freemason Stones
Hi everyone, my dad who passed away in 2017, was part of a lodge in Freiburg (Germany).

He was gifted these stones from his brotherhood few years before passing. Now that i went through all the stuff i inherited i came across these. Could anyone tell me what they are or if they have a specific meaning? I appreciate any info you may have.

Ps:Happy New Year!
Past master told me I'm not a brother in good standing?
Apologies for the long post: TLDR: petitioned scottish rite, lost my job and chose not to pursue but my past master is telling me I'm not in good standing because I did so before losing job and being unable to pay blue lodge dues.

As the title says, a past master of my blue lodge told me he doesn't "view me as a brother in good standing" because I had petitioned scottish rite in September, and after I did, my employer removed everyone's base pay making my financial situation extremely difficult to the point I haven't even been able to get by without significant help from family even with getting a new job that pays way less.

I had told the lodge secretary, who wanted to accompany me to a scottish rite initiation, that I could no longer join scottish rite because of this, and my mentor requested my dues for 2023 be waived without me ever asking or mentioning it to them. 

Then I get this text from my initial contact in masonry, our first worshipful: 

"Good morning Neil, I want to whisper good council in your ear. Remember that in your MM degree?
  I understand that you have asked for relief from Sunrise lodge for your dues because of hardship. Yet you have petitioned the Scottish Rite for membership.
  If you loose your membership to your blue lodge then you get dropped from all other Masonic bodies that you belong to or try to belong to. 
  The lodge voted to approve your request (I did not). That does not show you as a good mason, not paying your dues for one body so you can join another.  Just whispering good council in your ear.
  I wish you a Happy New Year and hope you start making better decisions in 2023"

Am I in the wrong here? I genuinely thought I had navigated this properly and explained to everyone I spoke to that I would likely be able to pay my 23 dues after my next check but they voted to wave them without me asking them to do so. Just rather confused because he's basically telling me I'm making poor decisions etc. Any insight is greatly appreciated brothers.

Freemasonry
I am interested in the Fraternity, but I am far away from home. I am in the state of Texas and I really want to petition a lodge to join this beautiful organization. I would like some guidance on how I can go about joining this order, also I am Active Duty Military.
Ideas for Change
First and foremost I'm 100% aware that radical change and Freemasonry don't go hand in hand. I'm also in no way suggesting we tear it down and start over. I've just been letting my mind wander about ways to stay meaningful and effective (however you define it) in a vastly different world than the 18th century (and earlier). If you had the power to make one BIG change to any aspect of Freemasonry in 2023, what would it be?
Grandfather was a freemason, found this in my deceased father's possessions. Is it related to freemasonry?

Is it worth it?
Hey guys, I was initiated last April and have made little progress toward fc. My mentor has been very available, but life has kept me from meeting regularly. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice on moving forward. My lodge brothers are kind and nice to be around, but is there really more than the fellowship? A couple of brothers allude to ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù, but meetings seem to just be housekeeping. I was hoping for more.
So I was building on my personal world in Minecraft, and wanted to make the S&C, (last photos are of my world) Is it frowned upon me doing so as an E.A? I suppose I should have asked before.

Multiple ¬´memberships¬ª
Hey there!
I am a 21year old boy who really consider joining freemasons, (or atleast ¬´apply¬ª)

But before I do I have some questions:
1. Can you be both freemason and a member of odd-fellows or/and rotary?
- or is it limited to only one fraternity?

2. If i get the honour of being accepted to  a lodge, what is the most important things to remember/ keep in mind?

3. is there any disadvantages of joining freemasons?

Feel free to answer in dm‚Äôs:)

I attended a 1st degree at a sister lodge in my county. the MWGM and two other GL officers were in attendance. the Grand Master gave me one of the pins he had made for his year as Grand Master.

A parade too far.
I have been a Mason for over a decade now and a question has haunted me ever since my days in the quarry. Why do Blue Lodges feel compeled to participate in parades?

My district is constantly encouraging us to attend all the parades we can as a lodge. Make floats, carry a banner. Throw out cheap candy. 

Is the idea behind this to increase our numbers? If parades did have some effect on membership I have not seen any official numbers from any source. I bring this up as a point because it is an activity that demands a time commitment from our already busy members. 

I know tone can be challenging to communicate in the text format. While I am slightly frustrated and confused by this culture of parades I am open to hearing why they work, or are important. Maybe there is something my district is missing in the equation?
Does the lodge only initiate at certain times of the year?

A humble question from a potential candidate.
I am currently in the process of deciding if freemasonry is for me. I have met with a brother and have a petition ready to be filled out. I am attending a lodge dinner early in January as well. I have always felt called to masonry. I have read countless titles by what seems to be respected authors. I want to know the true meaning of masonry before deciding to dedicate my life to it. Why do I see so many brothers discourage research and reading masonic books before joining? It's honestly quite off putting and makes me question my decision of wanting to join.
Freemasonry compatibility
Just wanted to say hello and that I have so many questions about the craft, toured the museum a few times lol my first question is, -hypothetically- assuming one is initiated to their third degree and thus takes that oath, but happens to know the secret of the 32nd degree etc, does the oath of the third entail the sworn secrecy of the third degree only, or does it encompass blanket secrecy for all degrees conferred therein?
endowments
Im still fairly new, i was raised this year and completed all turn ins for Blue Lodge. Im 35 and under grand lodge of texas. But my question is, how many newer masons are actually just paying out the endowments to forgo the annual dues? It seems like it will offer more freedom in some ways
Good Audible books?
Brethren,

I‚Äôm looking for some new books to listen to on Audible. I‚Äôm looking for good, entertaining Masonic books (not Morals and Dogma‚Ä¶) or some good history/fantasy series that a Freemason would enjoy. 

Thanks!
Generally speaking‚Ä¶
How long does it take from initiated to raised in the Northeast (US)? Thank you in advance.

This dummie is gonna learn a thing or two.

do you openly display you're a mason?
Hello Brothers!

I'm a newly raised MM and have been pretty open about being one. I don't go out and tell people but I do wear a necklace and ring, and my vehicle has a square and compass on it. 

However I've noticed many of my brothers in the lodge remove any masonic apparel when they leave and some even try and avoid bringing it up around others. 

I live in the US in a pretty tolerant state. 

Do you openly display you're a mason? Now I feel like I'm the odd one out in my lodge.
Masonic coin from my lodge.

Hello soon to be brothers! I have a question for everyone.
Hello and thank you for looking!

I was just informed I have two options:

The "day of light" which is a one day program that I will go through all three degrees in one day. 

Or 

Do my initiation with 3 three other people in my lodge.  

My question is, is doing the initiation we with others going to take anything from the experience?   I figure if it's going to take away from the experience of it being just me, perhaps just the one day is better.


I much, much prefer to go the "traditional route" as I want to learn more and really learn. 

Let me know your thoughts please. (I realize this is a debated topic here, but I can't recall seeing anything about others being initiated with others).

Thank you again.

Help regarding ballot!!!
I had been for my first interview meet in September but was asked to submit my forms and everything in a month. 
The ballot was supposed to be held sometime in December, I messaged my lodge secretary if I passed the ballot, but all he replied was never doubt yourself. 
Last when I spoke they had said I'll be joining from next year if I get through. I really don't know if I passed the ballot. 

What should I do ? Shall I wait or contact the Master Mason ?

Update:- 

Guys I got in. I just received a call yesterday stating it starts next month. I'm so excited and nervous. 
Thank you for your advice.

I'm ashamed of my lodge tonight
I'm currently the SW of a lodge in Alabama, but tonight I was in the East. We had a vote on a petition. The vote was on a good man, well spoken, veteran, family man, takes care of his kids. I met him at dinner before lodge. I was impressed. I liked the guy! The petition was read before the vote, the reports on him reported favorable in every way.  

The vote happened, one black ball. 

Did I mention the petitioner was black? Several brothers spoke before the second vote, just in case this was in error. Vote for the good of the order. I was pissed. I spoke my piece, as did many others. 

Second vote, same result. 

I've never been more ashamed, and I don't know how to react. I'm not used to leaving lodge without being in a good mood.
Does "Euphemia Regina, Masonic Queen of Wisdom" refer to an actual figure from history or Masonic lore?
I'm researching a guy by the name of John Murray Spear who founded a rather peculiar spiritualist sect back in the 19th century, and a splinter sect of Spear's group founded by another guy named Increase van Deusen. Van Deusen and his followers repeatedly mention someone they call "Euphemia Regina, the Masonic Queen of Wisdom", and I'm trying to figure out who they're referring to, or if it's just someone they invented. They never go into much detail, so the name and title are all I have to go on. There's a bref mention of Jerusalem in connection to her, but it isn't clear if that's where she's supposed to be queen of.

Brothers:

&#x200B;

Apologies if this is a re-post. My ability to search this forum is poor and didn't help me grab an answer. if there is a similar question out there, can you just link me?

&#x200B;

I was raised to a MM back in 2016. The whole of my degree work occurred over maybe 4-6 months, which seems like a blink given that I was working multiple jobs and at a very transitionary time in my life. Then, within a few months of being raised (and attending the lodge regularly), I had a life event causing me to move across the country and away from my lodge. I will not be returning in the foreseeable future but would like to continue my journey in Masonry.

&#x200B;

I have kept my dues current over the years, but due to multiple professional changes and then COVID, I have not been attending a lodge in my new region. I have, however, found one I really like, but this is where I've run into my problem:  **my masonic knowledge has withered to the point that I  can't pass any form of a serious challenge.** I'm not exaggerating when I say that what I do remember can be easily found with a google search. I've been challenged a few times and been unable to answer virtually any questions, self-stopping the challenge out of raw embarrassment and seeing no way forward.

&#x200B;

What would you advise I do? I wouldn't mind repeating the degree work with a lodge, but I'm not sure how "normal" that is? I wouldn't mind affiliating and learning from regular lodge participation, but I'd need to find a way to pass a challenge first. I'm willing, but basically ignorant. Ideas?

Congratulations and a question
So let me start by saying congratulations to all Brethren who took office on this St. John‚Äôs day. 

I saw a lot of posts and it raised a question of terminology, that I‚Äôm sure will mostly come down to ‚Äújurisdictional‚Äù but I wanted to find out how other jurisdictions did things. 

In PA we only ‚Äúinstall‚Äù elected officers (WM, SW, JW, Treasurer, Secretary, GL representative, and our Trustees. 

That leaves our other positions (Sr. Deacon, Jr. Deacon, chaplain, pursuviant, Sr. Master of ceremonies, Junior Master of ceremonies, and Tiler) to be simply appointed. 

Essentially we draw a line between our chair officers (who are listed on notices, etc. and our floor officer who rotate a lot. 

Tl;dr What my question boils down to is, does your jurisdiction install all officers or is there a subset that are installed and others just assume the office?
I made a Temple / Lodge in No Man's Sky - A few of the other video game created lodges from prior posts here inspired this one!

Scottish / York Rite
I am a recently raised Master Mason and at my raising, I was given a petition for a local Scottish Rite body. I have been meditating on the decision on whether to petition them or not. 

I‚Äôm interested in knowing more about what both bodies do and what the benefits of joining the bodies might be. If there are any brothers in those bodies, could you possibly give just a brief statement on what SR / YR does and what drew you to them and what keeps you around. 

Thank you brothers!

EDIT: Thank you Brothers and others for the outstanding advice. I‚Äôve enjoyed reading about what the YR and SR are about. I probably should have stated this prior but I do intend on waiting until I am more settled to join a separate body. Thank you again and hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season!

Afternoon,

Has anyone read the book The Red Lion by Maria Szepes, who it is noted was into Hermeticism?

I am interested as to other opinions.

This church is heavily anti-Masonic. As a result I have kept my mouth shut about being a Mason, but that extends to social media where I have been quite proud to share Masonic things in the past. On the one hand I don't feel having to hide it is fair to me. But, on the other hand, I don't want my mom viewed negatively at her church. What would you do in my position?
In Memory of Holy St. John, but Which St. John?
December 27th is known as St. John's Day in most Masonic jurisdictions. But, why and who? The [answer is not particularly clear](http://www.midnightfreemasons.org/2015/12/st-john-evangelist.html#:~:text=The%20Midnight%20Freemasons%3A%20St.,John%20the%20Evangelist%20%2D%20Revisit) and might even vary by your Grand Lodge. But, regardless, hope you are all having a great St John's Day tomorrow and for those who are officially starting their term of office on this day, Godspeed.
Spirituality
Does anyone else find it to be a MAJOR turn off to masonry when it gets super spiritual? I love the inclusion of all faiths and don‚Äôt mind learning stories, but I‚Äôm not really interested in spiritual lessons. I come to lodge for my material self, I go to church for my spiritual self.
English past master emblem
Several months ago this sub really came through for me with some suggestions for lectures for the presentation of gloves.  I need some direction again. Does anyone have or know of any lecture associated with the symbolism of the Past Master emblem? Specifically the English style (47th problem dangling from a square).  Thanks in advance!
Recommendations for masonic magazines
Recently raised and I was wondering if anyone could provide recommendations for Freemason magazines? This thread has been great, but I‚Äôm looking for longer articles on related topics. They can be print or digital. Thanks in advance!

Hey guys, can you recommend few books to read on Freemasonry, and reddit Freemasonry related communities to join? Thanks in advance

Freemason images?
I feel like I‚Äôve seen these images in relation to freemasonry. It‚Äôs our family Bible passed down (history of masonry). Is it just coincidence that they are at the start of the Bible due to freemasonry‚Äôs use of biblical allegory? Or more?
Quick question
I'm very interested in joining Freemasonry. I have been told Freemasonry is about making good men better. In what way has Freemasonry made you a better person? 

Also, do you all recommend the traditional route for the greater mystery or the weekend degrees?

Square & compasses symbols index?
There seems to be a few non-Masonic fraternal, or trade groups that use the square and compasses (or something very close to it) as a symbol. I'm wondering if there are enough of them to create some sort of index of them to help people identify things like the "[Free Gardeners](https://sites.scran.ac.uk/shelf/free/08.php)" who [seem to have used a S & C along with a folding pruning knife](https://sites.scran.ac.uk/shelf/free/images/ED_6_1_031.jpg) as a symbol. Would it be something that might help deal with the periodic "is this a Masonic symbol" posts that keep showing up?
Wishing everyone a #merrychristmas #christmas2022, Happy Holidays, and all the best in 2023! We hope you are spending the weekend with friends, family, and loved ones (& brothers)!

What is freemasonry?
Why can‚Äôt you find any specific information about what freemasonry actually is? Is it a secret? Everything is vague.

‚ÄúFreemasonry is a fraternity that is based on the principles of brotherhood, charity, and truth. Freemasonry is not a religion, and it does not prescribe any particular set of beliefs or require its members to adhere to a particular religion. Freemasonry is open to men of all faiths who believe in a Supreme Being and who are of good character. ‚Äú

Which is awesome, but can anyone provide any other info than this? How do you know if you want to join or not if the info is a secret?

I Need Help Finding Information
My Step-Grandfather passed away six years ago and had an enormous coin collection. My grandma finally decided to sell some of them, but we found this jar of foreign coins. There was one that caught my eye. I looked at it and it was 202 years old. Through further inspection, I  looked at it and it was 202 years old. Through further inspection, I have reason to suspect this is a "Mark Penny" because it has masonic symbols on it. On the front face, it has a keystone in the middle with a chisel to the left and a hammer to the right. On the keystone, there is a circle with the letters HTWSSTKS. Above the keystone is the word 'one' and on the bottom, 'penny'. Around the outside are the words, "THEY RECEIVED EVERY MAN A PENNY" and on the bottom of the outer edge is "CANADA" with an upside down 'Tau' on either side. On the back side...I'll just go from the center outwards on this one. A small sun in the center of a Star of David. The Star of David has I think six lines of texture in it. I don't really know how to describe it. Around the Star, though, is "Instituted A.IN V.2350" on the top and "A.D.1820" on the bottom. On the outer edge of the coin is "PREVOST CHAPTER R.A.M.No.3.Q.R." on the top and "DUNHAM, QUE" on the bottom, with a plus on either side. The pluses and the taus both have serifs. The coin as a whole seems to be black or brown on the inside with a very worn-off coating of gold or brass. If you can help me find out where this coin came from or who, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.
A question about freemasonry
Hello everyone, I am very interested in joining freemasonry and I just had a quick question: do you have to be public about your affiliation with the organisation or do you not have to tell anyone?
Freemasonry vs AMORC
Hi, I once began the process of meeting with some masons in my city about a year ago while still in college and was planning to petition a lodge. I ended up telling them I‚Äôd like to hold off on the process due to time restraints with school plus I think I just got cold feet a little bit about not really knowing what I was getting myself into. Now that I have graduated I am thinking it would be nice to restart the process. I am interested in masonry because I believe I am a pretty good person and am always striving to be better. From my research I believe masonry can help me develop an even better moral code and would be nice to be apart of a brotherhood. I also believe it would be really cool to go through the same degrees that so many cool people in history have been through and see what it is like. I also am interested in some sort of spiritual development. For pretty much the same reasons I have been interested in Rosicrucianism specifically (AMORC) and am wondering what thoughts masons might have about this order. Are there alot of similarities between the two? I remember one of the other candidates had mentioned he was apart of AMORC and one of the masons I was meeting with said something along the lines of ‚Äúoh great so you will already have a pretty good understanding of the work we do‚Äù do we know which order dates back further in History? I know these are a lot of questions but any general thoughts will help!
I feel I've piled myself with too much to do come next meeting which is a passing ceremony.
I am the SD for my lodge and will be conducting for the fc degree come early next month, which requires a lot of work. I didn't know it required so much work for the perambulation. i ended up offering myself to also do WT for the FC degree out of enthusiasm, now i feel i am stuck ,because time is almost up and still working to perfect the degree work and still have to learn the WT too.

I've spoken to Wm and he cant seem to find any one who is willing to do the WT during the ceremony. Do you think it will be a good idea to ask the Wm if i can read the WT to the Candidates, instead of pouring it out from memory? How should i handle this case?

"The Lodge is a representation of the local community" is not an excuse for ignorance
I've seen this written before in response to people bringing up issues of racism, or extreme opinions, and other things in their Lodge. While I suppose it makes sense on the surface, I think this is a poor excuse. We are not a random sampling of our community. We a good men with high standards, trying to be our best selves. We are not criminals, for example, but those people are still part of our communities aren't they? If we are simply a direct representation of the community as a whole, does that mean we aren't doing anything to actually better ourselves? If you abide by certain rules of conduct only during the actual meeting because you are forced to, but don't put them into practice anywhere else in life, do you even believe in them? 

Yes this rant is directed at a small percentage of us, but I had to vent. I can't stand that crap thrown around so casually.
Great night

Masonic Themed History in Boston?
Wife is tagging along on a business trip to Boston at the end of June (ASME conference) so I have an excuse to do some sightseeing.

Also if anybody knows any lodges meeting or better doing a social event during that week we'd love to hear about it.  We're going to fly in Sun 25th through probably the following Saturday, maybe Sunday.

Thanks!

Canadian Freemasons?
I am doing some family research and am aware of an ancestor from Merrickville Ontario who was a Freemason. He was born in 1785 and died in 1877, by the name of Luke De Pencier. 
I know there is a lodge based nearby to where he is buried, Merrickville Lodge No. 55.
Is there anyone with any knowledge of Canadian Masonic history that might help with research?

Masonic lodges in Iran
Hello there. I‚Äôm a fellow masonic enthusiast from Iran and this is a throwaway account for obvios reasons.

It has been many years that I have been in love with the fraternity and I always wanted to join, but unfortunately I live in Iran and there are no official masonic lodges here because of the islamic government. Is it possible that I can join a lodge in another country and visit couple of times per year? If not, are there any masonic lodges recruiting online or any underground lodges that I can find? I know it may seem absurd to you, but the situation here is real bad.

Another unrelated question: before 1979 revolution, we had a very powerful grand lodge that had a vast network of politicians and businessmen and scientists. If circumstances change, who will oversee the reopening of the grand lodge in Iran? Is there an international body for such stuffs?

Demitted and rejoined‚Ä¶
So I demitted from my Mother Lodge ( which was under [Grande Loge de France](https://gldf.org)) in favor of [Grande Loge Nationale Fran√ßaise](https://www.glnf.fr) (the only French Grand Lodge recognized worldwide). My job demands me to travel a lot and even though in France we can visit anywhere, I couldn‚Äôt do that abroad so I needed to fix that issue and feel recognized everywhere on the globe. I was a bit sad because my Mother Lodge did great work and the Brethen were amazing but the issue of recognition is a bit complex outside of France. In France, we are all Freemasons regardless of your Grand Lodge or Obedience (we have a lot of them. Over 15‚Ä¶) Anyways, I am happy to be at the ‚Äúright‚Äù place now. My new lodge is way younger and I speak almost everyday with the Brethen which was not the case at my former lodge‚Ä¶
Question re. rejoining...
Will do my best to keep it short...

Joined a lodge in my early 20s... looking back, I was far too young for the honour and my commitment fluctuated, but I kept paying my dues.

By my late 20s, I had completely dropped off the map, changed addresses, stopped paying dues and attending lodge.  Family issues, health issues and various challenges ensued and eventually I ended up homeless.

(Fell out of contact with all bros.)

Fast Forward to my early 40s... I now comfortably have my shit together and often think of rejoining a different lodge (in another area).

Would I be persona non grata?  Could I expect to be on the hook for unpaid dues?

Thanks in advance.

Catholic Masons
I don't want to run the risk of stirring up a contentious discussion, but I'm interested in getting a broader view of things.

For background: I was/am a cradle Catholic who stopped pursuing the faith years and years ago. Never apostatized into atheism, obviously since I joined the Craft, but I had a journey of spirituality to go on to find a home. At long last, I find myself being pulled back into Catholicism.

I know that Freemasonry takes all good men of all religions. I am also aware of the attitude of the Catholic Church toward Freemasonry. Like many (all) things it falls somewhere on a spectrum depending on who you talk to. Some tradcaths are hardline against it as sinful. Some are more open to it, seeing the Craft as an organization that does good. I know there are some KoC groups that work with Lodges here for breakfasts/fundraisers.

Luckily, I seem to have found a church where the Priest is pretty open to it, acknowledges that some others might say I'm going to hell (from a Catholic perspective) for being a Mason, but he thinks we're a good group. I don't think he'll exclude me from the eucharist if I don't demit from the Fraternity, which is nice.

To sum all that up, I'm curious if there are many other practicing Catholics in the Craft? To what degree do you adhere to the CCC while also being a Mason? Are you open about your membership with your clergy? If this isn't the best topic for open discussion, I welcome any private messages. I guess I could use a little encouragement that I can maintain my membership in the group that frankly guided my journey home to the Church while also being able to complete the sacraments of initiation and be a moderately active and devout Catholic.

Thanks!

Prince Hall OES and HOJ help for muddling archivist
Hi,

I work for a library and we received a collection of Prince Hall affiliated Order of Eastern Star and Heroines of Jericho papers and it is all mixed together in the same boxes. And there are other affiliations like Omega Grand Court, Ladies of the Circle of Perfection, etc. It is really hard for me to figure out where to put things to make an order of it all.  I know there are lots of histories out there, but can someone recommend a chart of Prince Hall auxiliaries or just something comprehensive to help me get a broad understanding of what is what? 

PS I recently received notice that my petition has gone through to the OES chapter (not Prince Hall) by my house and I'm looking forward to initiation and learning more.
Peer Pressure to join Freemasonry has taken me from a certified candidate to an outright skeptic, the "obligation" scares me as a young busy professional.
Hello All,

First and foremost thank you for contributing and taking the time to read this.

&#x200B;

The past decade due to strong family ties inside my Towns lodge, I've been able to get sneak peaks of what this Brotherhood of men stands for. When people say the Freemason are full of undeniable great men, they really aren't kidding! The master at the time has become a close friend to me, as well as our Chairmen Chaplin(i think i said that right?) has devoted time to meet with me and ask about my future goals.

&#x200B;

My cousin however is the elected webmaster for his lodge, and recently has been pushing me very hard on the time to join. Before, when i was younger i basically was counting down the days. However, he keeps talking about this "obligation" and going through ceremonies and learning the secret language, and it all just sounds so overwhelming. Plus, the upfront fees for joining and Dues are about $300. My issue is, I'm young 24 and i Just started my Master Degree Program and will be drowning in books till I'm 26. $300 is the cost of my books for one semester so in perspective it is a lot!  As well, i work In my Field for my Master and own a small business that operates 6 Days a week Between 4PM-10PM. The idea of learning this second language and having to recite it off the top of my head for ceremonies and attending meetings, I just worry its to much time with attending lectures and having my own obligations in business.

&#x200B;

My issue is I don't want to let people down. Their Master the people I've met through Masonry are all great people that i would hate to disappoint. My cousin acts as if because I'm valuing my time so critically that I wouldn't be a good Mason and that I'm lacking the core fundamentals if i cant put aside my own personal gains to stand for something more and give back to the community instead of just looking out for my own well being. He says if i cant adjust my life for 3 months to go through the Ceremonies, (Apprentice, Fellowcraft, Master Mason) then I shouldn't be a mason.

&#x200B;

I guess my question is, have other Freemason in other lodges seen cases where maybe the Trial to becoming a Master Mason take longer than 3 months, like is it so clear cut that its either do it in 3 months or get kicked out? I would assume something like so should be understanding. I mean the biggest challenge freemasonry sees is in there rapid member decline. would they really toss me out because with my Busy life it might take me 6-8 months to become a Master instead of 3?

&#x200B;

Thank you again for your time this decision is a conflicting one in my life as I do see the benefits of joining however if its so clear cut I just might be too busy for it currently.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Update: to Everyone asking, I didn't want to post the specific lodge, as I'm sure my Family might notice a correlation between the post and the location. However, I'm 98% sure its a legit Lodge.

I Contacted my local lodge.
I Contact my local lodge to ask questions and clarify doubts about how to become a freemason. First they invited me to attend an event and talk about it but apparently they had to cancel it. They are asking me for a resume, a letter of intent and an affidavit certifying that I have never belonged to Freemasonry. I have doubts about the type of resume I have to write. What would you recommend? is this a normal procedure?

Masonic Beards
I've observed that the percentage of Masons that sport beards is quite a bit higher than among the average male population. (At least in the US). 

Do you have a beard? If so, did you have one before you were raised? Does the craft cause beard growth??

Joining
Gentlemen.  I‚Äôve been thinking about joining freemasonry for around two months.  I live a block away from a Masonic lodge.  What is the best way of going about applying?  I‚Äôd like to just knock on the front door and ask since that‚Äôs the type of guy I am,  is there a more proper channel I should go through?  Also I just recently enlisted in the army,  would this impact my joining?  Any advice is appreciated.
Once the temple of Solomon is built the ark of the covenant will be revealed
Hello all! I am not yet initiated into the fraternity but I have been studying Freemasonry for several years now. I have read The Morals And Dogma twice now. I noticed that in that book a lot of material is taken directly for the ‚ÄúDoctrine and Ritual of High Magic‚Äù by Eliphas Levi. I have read that book 4 times. I am very interested in joining now and have been calling lodges in my area. If anybody has any tips or insight I‚Äôd love to hear it!
Anniversary Year Of Anderson's Constitution 1723.
I think this would be a great opportunity for the fraternity to reproduce a beautiful hardcover version of Anderson's Constitution of 1723. This being its 300 year anniversary. I see a bunch of anniversary stuff on Freemasonry Hall's store website but I cant find anyone printing a nice hardcover version of the Constitution for studying . Dose anyone know if there are plans to print one or if there is a version out there? I know i can read it in PDF form but i prefer books.

Hello Brothers, I am moving from Europe to Las Vegas, NV. I am part of a "Recognized" European G‚à¥L‚à¥ and I am looking for a new masonic home in Las Vegas.

I don't know how true this is but I was told that some Lodges in the U.S. can make Masons very, very fast (less than a year per degrees) and that some Lodges don't even have philosophical discussions or even masonic educations and that they turned into basic pancake clubs. I am sure that this is grossly caricatural and I hope that I am not hurting anyone with my ignorance but if there is a glimpse of truth in what I was told, I would like to steer away from these types of Lodges.

I am looking for a Lodge;

* That has a strong educational program for their new members (*I would not mind going through the degree again to discover the American (York) rite.*). And take its time.
* That requires its members to present planches (*Masonic research papers*) that we can discuss in Lodge.
* That has a strong fellowship and great Agapes and Table Lodges.
* That requires to be dressed decently for Lodge.
* That respects the Ritual.
* That has philosophical and educational discussions at every meeting.
* And not too big! Max 50 members. (*I was told that some American Lodge can have up to 100 members, where brothers don't even know each other.*).

Thank you for your help brothers, again I hope that I am not coming across as rude, this is not my intention at all and sorry again for my ignorance.

I hope to be able to join you soon.

So this is my first year at the secretary's desk. My predecessor gifted me his briefcase when he stepped down. Sadly, I'd say it's probably from the 70s and has seen better days, so I'm looking at retiring it. What briefcase do you carry?

Looking To Become A Mason In Scotland!
Hi guys,

So I‚Äôve recently started doing some research on becoming a Mason here in Scotland and I‚Äôve learned that I need 2 Masons to know me to be able to invite me to join.

A little about the reason I started my research, a few years ago now (2019) I lost my father. I found it very hard to deal with and it was struggle to try to wrap my head around facthe wasn‚Äôt with us anymore. Since his passing, my friends have also drifted further away from me and I also found that hard to deal with. I still even to this day struggle at times to deal with it all.

Due to all of this I have found myself searching for some sort of new purpose in my life, like I want to be apart of something bigger than myself and this had led me to the freemasonry. My father wasn‚Äôt a Mason and no one I know or speak to us either and I‚Äôm wondering what would be the best way to try and join? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Any brother working with IT/Technology? How we can bring innovation to the order?
Hey brothers. Let me introduce myself very quickly: I am a apprentice, just starting out my journey. 

I joined a lodge here in my country (Brazil) and  I noticed that our order is mostly composed by old brothers, who does not have an eye for technology and new trends (I don't mean any offense, I am not saying this is bad or good. I am myself a old-school minded guy).

We know that our world is rapidly changing, new technologies, new kind of jobs, new trends, and I don't think that we have to "follow up" with \*all\* those new trends. But, at least to some degree, we have to catch-up to be able to use some of those technologies in our favor, and I would like to know if any brethren out there would like to share any thoughts in this topic. 

What we can do to bring innovation to the order? How we can catch-up with this new world (ofc, without loosing our roots)? There's any brethren out there who work with Technology who have any ideas? For example, another day I thought about a "virtual" lodge composed by software developers and technology enthusiasts, some kind of a mastermind. 

Anyway, I just would like to start this conversation and to know what the brothers think.
What‚Äôs the best way to ask a mason to join? What was your experience? What should I know ahead of time before asking?
So I‚Äôve been browsing through this subreddit for a while, and I think it was the final piece of supporting evidence that really made me want to make the final push and ask to join. 

My step-grandfather is a mason and tells me stories about the brotherhood all the time. I‚Äôve wanted to ask him for years if I could join but now I really want to do it. 

Is there anything I should be aware of before asking him? Should I study anything beforehand? How do I show him that I do believe myself to be a man of good moral character who wants to be great?

Edit: I called him up and before even saying anything, he knew exactly why I was calling and said ‚ÄúDONE!‚Äù

Freemasons on mastodon?
With everything going on on twitter, I started thinking about trying out mastodon. Seems like although you can follow anyone from any instance, it matters which instance you join in terms of what kind of stuff you can easily discover. And I'd like to join an instance where I can easily discover freemasonry-related content.   


Any brothers have experience with mastodon, and have any recommendations on instances where freemasons tend to gather/post?
Mauritius üá≤üá∫ Freemasonry
Hi all. 
All goes well (poorly child!) we‚Äôre off to Mauritius on Saturday for two weeks. If I am able to get away at some point for a wander round the island I was going to be incredibly boring and go have a look at any lodges I can find. 

Found the address of what appears to be the main lodge in Port Louis. Does anyone know if there are any others?

The Grand Lodge website is a bit sparse and no response from email address. Seems to have been an interesting history. 
Any info gratefully received.

An interesting curiosity
I happened upon this collection of early scientific journals on natural science and some on theology. They are from a group called the Sozinianer. From what I gather they were mostly German and Polish and held a non trinity view of Catholicism and were deemed heretics by the Pope. The writings are from the 17th century for the most part. They are also in latin. For any other nerdy brothers might be worth a look.

Problems trying to leave Royal Arch
Dear Companions,

Greetings. On September 1st I left my lodge due to personal reasons. Since that date I have been trying to leave Chapter with no success. The thing is that according the general regulations of the Chapter I am automatically out if I leave the lodge; however, they should provide me with a document that states that I leave in good standing and that I am indeed a Royal Arch Mason. This document is necessary because if in the future I want to rejoin, I do not have any proof of my degrees nor that I left in good standing.

The Grand Secretary of the Supreme Grand Chapter told me that this document should be issued by the Chapter. However the High Priest told me in September that I was going to obtain an answer to my request in due time. After that I have not received reply and my emails and messages have been ignored.
Is it possible to take this situation with the General Grand Chapter?

Note: I am in Portugal. We have the Supreme Grand Chapter under the jurisdiction of the General Grand Chapter. I obtained demit from my lodge in September and I already formally requested the one of chapter several times. The thing also is that fees here are paid annually and if I am not officially out of the chapter right now in December I will not be in good standing since next month. BTW I do not have any proof of degrees as diplomas were never issued.
is this weird or not?
Im in contact with my local Le Droit Humain - lodge. I mentioned I've been doing research and based some of my questions on the information gleaned.

My contact said it's best not to research it too much, that it would be like peeking through wrapping paper at a present amd spoiling it for yourself, when you should rather wait to open it.
Is this strange or am I misunderstanding?
I would want someone to study something as much as they can to get an idea of everything. 
Much appreciated and thank you in advance.

Edit: Thank you for the quick replies, everyone. I appreciate it!

Elected as WM in a dim lodge, any advice?
Hello Brethren!

I was just elected as WM of my lodge last night after being raised in 2018, and COVID has affected our lodge drastically, whereas before, we had a minimum of 20 people at each meeting and practice nights, now we're lucky if we have enough members to fill the chairs on a regular meeting night, and on practice nights we're lucky if more than 3 show up.

I've got a very good community outreach team that will be the backbone of our volunteer work, so we'll at least have ourselves out there for prospective candidates to meet and interact with us, however, I'd also like to bring our current members back as the last 3 years has been very dim.

I'll be extending an open invitation to our members and their families, as well as our widows for our fellowship dinners in an attempt to bring our members back, as well as a family movie night once a month. I'm hoping this will work to bring more members back, but I'd love to hear what advice the brethren may have regarding this topic.
Hey Guys, i found this in my House and i think its something from the freemason lodge. Does anyone here ever seen this?

Live respected, die regretted.
Background: working on a lodge education program on the phrase, "live respected, die regretted." 

Curious: USA Mason here. I don't know of any ritual line that has the words, live respected, die regretted or a similar passage but I've seen vague statements it's in non US ritual parts. 

Realizing this is an open forum......

Is this called out specifically in ritual somewhere? I'm not asking for the verbiage but just a confirmation it's specifically called out in your ritual. 

Thanks.
Found this about great grand father!

Does a candidate need to inform the lodge about his membership and studentship in other esoteric orders?

A Knights Pilgrimage

Just wanted to share how thoughtful brothers can be‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm currently petitioning a lodge here in AZ, putting in my 6 months etc..

last night the lodge had an open installation which I was happy to attend, but what really made my night was the dinner and the first few minutes of the night. As soon as I walked in I noticed they had placed 2 menorahs (hanukkiahs) in the window along with some Jewish themed ornaments on the Christmas tree. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough.. the dinner was a big smoked pork meal. But just for me was a side of the most delicious grilled chicken I‚Äôve ever had. 

This was all done because I‚Äôm the only Jewish attendee at the lodge and the first in who knows how long. I‚Äôm also likely the only Jew in town (half native, half Mormon town). I‚Äôve never felt more welcome as a Jewish person like this, outside of a Jewish function. Words cannot express how thankful I am to be petitioning a lodge with such thoughtful brothers.
Found an Unmarked Apron, Had Questions.
I found a white leather apron while cleaning the apartment of someone who had passed. It has the Freemason Symbol, the square and compass, aswell as marks for who would give and receive it. However, the areas are blank.

I have no idea what to do with it. I have family who are Freemasons, but I'm afraid it mighy offensive or rude to present it to them.

The Apron is marked "Presented By Austin Lodge No.12, A. F. & A. M. Austin Texas".
Tip #13: If you want a successful Lodge, stop wasting everyone's time
In my estimation, I've spent probably 30-40% of the Masonic year in poorly run meetings. Seeing these bodies apparently don't have enough time to perform essential functions, this is becoming beyond frustrating and some are seeing the natural conclusion where Brothers just stop showing up. And who can really blame them? Most of these guys work and have families.

So, here are some common sense tips that maybe some people can use to help in this area:

* If you are not an organized person, either learn how to properly facilitate a meeting or delegate it to someone who can do so. Nothing says that you have to run the meeting just because you have the "Chair" (or equivalent) title.
* If you are in charge of the meeting, but don't have a plan on what you are actually going to do at that meeting, like in the form of an agenda or at least outline, chances are your meeting is going to be a waste of time or an abject failure.
* If you tell people attendance is "important," then "imperative," then cajole them into making the meeting, but show up late and have no plan for that actual meeting, don't expect them to ever make showing up a priority again.
* If the purpose of the meeting is to organize something, defer to the people that have experience in the area. For instance, if you are planning your installation and are not sure of procedure, don't talk over the District ritual instructor because "one time, years ago" you are pretty sure it was done differently. Then don't get into an argument with him while ten people watch it go down on Zoom.
* When people give you fair warning that they have to go, and your meeting is running late (especially if due to any of the above) take heed and try to expedite what needs to get covered. Then, when you are still stumbling through don't get pissy at the guys that quietly excuse themselves because they need to leave.
* Lastly, don't send out a mass email to the Lodge calling out the few guys who left while alluding that the Brothers who could not make it were being lazy. That won't endear yourself as a leader to anyone and just looks petty.

None of this is hard to do, but if you manage to apply just a few of these tips they will pay out huge dividends.

Symbolism of the mind
I've heard Brothers refer to the Lodge and it's characteristics as symbols of operating your own mind. Is there any go-to writing on this specific interpretation?

Tip #17: Want a Successful Lodge? Give Brothers Something of Value
Brothers invest their time and money into the Lodge. It should strive to give them some sort of return of investment on that.

Just like people sell stocks that are going to lose value or jettison depreciating assets before they become worthless, same rules and logic apply to their perceived value of paying that dues bill and giving up a few nights a month.
Waiting.
So I had posted here before asking for advice due to me being black balled and I thought I‚Äôd post again.

After my black balling, I was under the impression that I couldn‚Äôt re-petition until next year according to the secretary. So I was told by a plural member of a neighboring lodge that I could petition it and continue my journey there. It‚Äôs a small lodge with only around 8 active members most of which are in their 70s. After visiting and meeting the members I decided to petition. 

After petitioning, I was informed that I could petition a lodge as many times as they would allow and it had said so in the bylaws. At that point I was going to stick to my current petition. 

So now I wait to be voted on. Three  months had gone by and no meeting had been held. Mostly due to lack of people needed to open, one due to the WM being out of town. Every two weeks I‚Äôd get the dreadful text or phone call ‚ÄúSorry man, no meeting this time‚Äù. 

One day whiles I was working, the WM of the lodge I was black balled in told me I could petition again if I wanted to and the members there would like to have me. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. 

Now I‚Äôm torn between two lodges. I want to maybe help get the smaller lodge on its feet, but I also want to be super active. I love both lodges and I‚Äôll definitely be plural members of both in the end. I guess I‚Äôm just tired of waiting, it‚Äôs not the small lodges fault for not being able to meet. I love being around members of both. 

I thought I‚Äôd throw this out to the almighty wise members of Reddit. To see there opinions and thoughts.

Many Thanks,

Me

Suggested interview questions for Grand Lodge magazine
My good Brethren,

My GL is reintroducing our Masonic magazine for publication and they've made a call for entries.

Now at first thought just to submit articles of interest here and there, history, poetry and such. But it has just occurred to me that an interview format would be a great submission as well.

My humble question to you all, is a request for suggestions on good, thoughtful questions to ask both new and experienced brethren that will breathe life into the experience.

The focus will be on Blue Lodge, and since I've just thought of this two questions I want to ask is how the Brother felt/what he remembered on the night before entering for the first time, another is the route and reasons for the route taken to seek more light.

Every suggestion would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks, and Fraternally yours

Founding a new lodge
Brethren all, thank you in advance for your consideration and your answers. Apologies for using a throwaway.

For reasons I am unwilling to go into here, some of my fellow MMs and I are feeling as though our lodge is beginning to drift in another direction from the one in which it was travelling when we joined. 


As it might be a slightly awkward question to ask of our Province at this stage (gossip etc.) can any of you point me in the right direction if we were to create a new lodge? Is this all in the book of consitutions? I've not yet turned to it as the thought of doing this is quite fresh and access to my laptop is currently easier than my copy of the book. 


My understanding is that the rule of 3,5,7 comes into play but is this the actual requirement under UGLE?


Have any of you been through the process and if so would you be willing to give me an outline?

Edit: Unable to respond to comments, but thanks for the replies. Will get back when able.

Greetings
I am new to this subreddit and thought I would "Introduce" myself.

I came to Masonry relatively late for two reasons. First, I was raised Catholic with 12 years Parochial School under my belt, then I joined the Navy in 1980, and served active for 10 years before being "medically retired" with a service-connected disability. Basically, I knew nothing of Masons and Masonry.

Fast forward to 2006. The Grand Lodge of Masson in Massachusetts began airing advertisements with "Ben Franklin." The "tag line" is that the way to become a Freemason is "to ask," and some info about how to find a Lodge in your area. I did, was Raised to the Sublime Degree in March of 2007. This campaign was very successful. I was actually in a class of 11 (Grand Lodge granted a dispensation, as his main agenda was to increase the number of new candidates that would, hopefully, go on the stare replacing Past Masters from having to play "Musical Chairs" and get some new blood into the Lodges.) We used an exemplar (One candidate to represent us all, a different one for each degree), while the rest of us had a mentor, a Bible given to each of us, and a small Square and Compasses, and took our obligations on them (I still have mine) Unfortunately, not all became active members. Then there were ones like me who went full blazes.

I joined the line as Inside Sentinel the next year, and quickly went through the Chairs, skipping several. I celebrated my 5th Masonic Birthday as Master of my Lodge. (I am currently the Historian of the Lodge) I had also started in York Rite and have been Excellent High Priest of my Chapter (and am currently presiding in that role again), Illustrious Master of my Council, and three-time Commander of our Commandery. I am a member of the York Rite College and KYCH and have my TIM (I am currently part of the Grand Council's team for that honor) I went "dormant" for a time. I would attend and fill in as needed, but not much else. (Basically, I hit my burnout point.) I am now, at age 60, starting to get active again (Going on DDGM visitations, Visiting other Lodges and York Rite Bodies in the Jurisdiction, etc.)

I just stumbled on the subreddit and thought that I may be able to help some who have questions and learn some new things myself.

How expensive is it to be a mason?
I am in the process of joining. 

I understand that I have to pay my dues yearly. However in wondering if there are any hidden costs that I should know about.
Master qualification in North Carolina
Does a brother receive the past master/ chair degree in NC before being installed WM? I can say that in NJ, I received it before my installation. My friend was just installed as WM in NC and he said he didn‚Äôt receive the chair degree. Is this just not done in NC?
Appendant Bodies - Which did you join first and why?
Very interested to see how you made your decision!

I won‚Äôt be eligible to join one until spring of next year, but the York Rite and Scottish Rite both sound equally interesting to me. I‚Äôve tried researching which route others have taken and seen so many different answers.

I‚Äôm primarily interested in the esoteric and philosophical side, so Scottish Rite sounds like the obvious first choice. But I‚Äôve heard that York Rite continues the ‚Äústoryline‚Äù from the Blue Lodge rituals, and I would love to learn and speculate on that.
Lodges in Okinawa
Hey brothers, I am a pretty freshly raised Master Mason and as I don't want my craft to grow rusty, I'm looking to be a part of a lodge while out here in Okinawa. I come from AF&AM in Illinois, and I'm having some troubles finding times for the lodges out here. Any help is appreciated!

On The Case: A Non-Exhaustive Review of Apron Case Options
About two years ago I had a little bit of my budget dedicated toward Masonic activity left over the end of the year so wanted to treat myself to a nice, new apron and case. Up until this point, I just kept my old cloth apron in the plastic bag in which it shipped or rolled it up and stuck it in an old poster tube. But, now I fully intended on having not only an apron worthy of a Freemason but also having a proper case for carrying and storing it.

Like almost everything we buy these days, I figured just jump on to the internet do a few searches and \*poof\* I would be inundated with options. Turns out that this would simply not be true. There were only a few vendors who had quality cases and reviews on those items varied greatly.

Note: This is an independent review. I am not linked to any of these companies, nor received any incentives or compensation to review any of these products.

**TLDR....**My sort-of-thorough survey led me to the conclusion that the best overall apron case commercially available is the [Masonic Revival Deluxe Apron Case](https://masonicrevival.com/collections/aprons/products/deluxesoftcase).

**Briefcase Style Apron Cases**

There are a variety of apron cases available that look like hard sided briefcases. This was originally the route I thought I would go and what most of the guys in my Lodge carry. However, when I started investigating options I was not as sure.

You will notice by doing a simple internet search that most of these cases appear to be the absolute same despite factthat they are marketed by about half a different companies. Prices vary but these can generally be acquired for $100-$120. Some claim to be real leather (if that matters) but the reviews suggest that it was just simulated leather that was cheap plastic.

I ordered one that was on sale from an Amazon seller which ended up getting returned. The case itself was fine, but the outside material was definitely not high quality. I don't think it was going to last so it got returned.

I also noted that this briefcase appeared to be similar to many other models that were not marketed as "apron cases" for much lower prices.

One option you might want to explore if you are interested in this style case is to go in person to a luggage store close to you to personally inspect the briefcase before purchasing. Also, if you travel on a train, plane, or bus you might want to look into the "half" briefcase option. It requires folding your apron in half but reduces overall size of the case.

This is not an endorsement of the vendor, but more than one Brother in my Lodge has been able to order what appears to be a nice, quality case from Brick Masons that is supposedly real leather. (The reputation of this vendor has been questioned on this sub and elsewhere so proceed with caution.)

**Soft Style Cases**

There are a variety of soft style cases available that come in many different materials. Usually the most common is a form of canvas, but imitation or real leather can also be found. It appears that most of these come from the same company as the dimensions and features are almost all identical. Some come with customization options such as adding an emblem or personalization. Prices also vary by vendor, so make sure to do some searches before pulling the trigger on your selection.

I ordered two and found that the Masonic Revival Deluxe case was far superior to the "generic" one obtained from another Masonic vendor. It was not even a close comparison when it came to quality of material, zippers, and other features.

**Other Options**

Not ready to pull the trigger on an apron case? Or just need something for longer term storage?

Check out "art portfolios" at your local art supply store to find one of a suitable size. Just note, many of these are not exceptionally sturdy. 

Also, if you don't mind rolling up your apron, a good old fashion poster tube will get the job done. I personally don't recommend this for long term storage though although it is convenient for travel.

Lastly, if you want a hardside case with some business flair, check out your local luggage store or thrift store. Look for the briefcase section. Finding one with the proper dimensions for a Masonic Apron can be difficult as most of these are sized for A4 paper, however some which are designed to hold laptops are big enough. It will be a lot of trial and error.
What to do in a social gathering for meeting with new candidates?
Hello!

There will be a social gathering very soon to meet with new candidates. I will be one of these candidates for the Lodge. I am in continental Europe. How/What is the nature of these gatherings? What should I do to impress others? What kinds of talks will happen? Philosophy, maybe? 

Any suggestion would be appreciated! Thanks in advance!

Great experience, it was something I have been looking forward to.  Now the work begins!
Installation Dinner Time!
Back to my home lodge after being out the past few days at other lodge installations!
I havent paid my dues in Wisconsin since 2020. More than likely not in good standing.
I don‚Äôt want to say the words but I am. If I could afford the dues I would. 

My life turned to garbage in 2 years. Really really quickly. Lost my grandma. Lost my relationship.  Was fired for PTSD. Moved from Wisconsin to Rockford Illinois. Head on car accident. If I said what I felt I would be hospitalized and I can‚Äôt afford that. I can‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs dehumanizing.

I can‚Äôt find a job I can physically do with benefits. And I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll run out of meds and have been very very quickly pulling off them to ration because I can‚Äôt afford the refills. I went from 10 pills, 5 medications, down to 2.  I‚Äôve been crying for two days straight. I just learned it‚Äôs December. I don‚Äôt know what happened to November. I pulled out of the driveway last night and was confused by peoples decorations. I didn‚Äôt know it wasn‚Äôt Halloween still. 

Just to feel any sort of comfort I‚Äôve been hooking up wherever. I want to feel loved. I want to feel needed. I feel as though I have nothing to show for myself. I've tried to stand up for so so long on my own. So freaking long. I'm tired. I'm tired of being tired. Because when Shit gets dark, sometimes I need a light that I can't make myself anymore. It's been dark for so long. 

I‚Äôm not at risk for S or S/H but I can‚Äôt pick up the pieces anymore. I‚Äôve got rent for a couplemonths. That‚Äôs it. And I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.
I am going to attend my local lodge for the second time in a few weeks. I have visited once and expressed my interest in joining, I was invited to stop by again. I was wondering, is there an etiquette for attire. Should I suit up to fit in? Or should I keep business casual?

Being installed as steward next week
I‚Äôm being installed as steward next Tuesday and this is my first chair. Any words of wisdom would be appreciated. TIA
Choked during ritual - struggling to get back
Hi brethren,

In my last lodge meeting, I took part in the ceremony delivering a piece of ritual to the candidate. I'm sure you've all been there - I was absolutely word perfect at rehearsal, could do the whole thing forwards and backwards while practising at home. I was even whispering it to myself all the way up to my part, no problem at all. I stood up, and after the first sentence, my mind completely blanked.

I was really embarrassed, and it felt like one of those bad dreams where things are going wrong for no reason. I got a few prompts to get me through the next couple of lines before recovering and delivering the rest of the piece with no issues, but I think I was visibly rattled and felt like such an idiot. I kind of pride myself on my ritual work, and it was my first time at a new lodge, so I really wanted to make a good impression. The brethren were of course very kind and understanding, but I can't stop replaying it in my mind. I've never choked like that before! Maybe it's not having done any ritual since before COVID, plus a new environment, I don't know.

Sorry for rambling brethren, I guess what I'm trying to ask is, how do you recover after feeling like you've failed? I know I'm taking it too personally but it's playing on my mind a lot. I'm doing a piece in January's ceremony too, and for the first time in my masonic career, feel like I have a bit of stage fright.

EDIT: Just wanted to say a massive thank you to all of the commenters who have given some great advice and some hilarious insights. I really appreciate all of you guys. Feeling positive about my next ceremony and can't wait to get myself back on track!
Just out of curiosity, are there any organizations that are similar to the Freemasons?

What is a square?

If you don't pay your dues and become suspended, are you still a Freemason?

As a new MM, after getting what I believe I can from being in Blue Lodge, what reasons would/should I have to join the YR, SR, or Shrine? Beyond just further fellowship with close brothers who are already in those bodies.
I really would like to take at least a year or two of just attending Blue Lodge before I even consider joining another appendant body, but beyond the extra responsibilities, dues, and meeting nights, what are the main reasons a brother would/should choose to join a given appendant body, beyond just spending more time with close brothers who are already in that body?

My limited understanding from speaking with brothers at my lodge is that they just tell different sides of the same narrative, with the YR leaning Christian, the SR leaning ostensibly omnist, and the Shrine just having a particularly strong tendency for charity. Is everyone's reason always wildly different? I'm just curious as to other brothers' answers.
What percentage of Masons don‚Äôt actually go through ‚ÄúThe Line‚Äù?
I‚Äôve been a MM and a member of both YR and SR for a number of years and I haven‚Äôt gone through the line. I work as a flight attendant and travel pretty much every week, so the time commitment for me isn‚Äôt feasible (although it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôd LIKE to do some day). I was wondering how many other brothers, for whatever reasons, never went through the line?

Chapter and Mark Masonry Costs
I was raised to the 3rd Degree (UGLE) last month - a truly brilliant experience! 

No sooner was the ritual book pressed into my hands after the ceremony, did an excited Brother try to extol the benefits of the Holy Royal Arch. 

As I‚Äôm saving to get married and hopefully buying a house in the next couple of years - I‚Äôm just wondering if any UGLE Brothers might offer an indication on how much the yearly fees you pay are for each unit.

I know and appreciate the way we‚Äôre encouraged to put our families and jobs before the Craft. An excellent chance to put the degree tools to use. But getting an idea of how much things cost would help us budget.

Really enjoying the historic story of it all right now. Looking forward to getting stuck into visiting in the new year!
Put in petition for the York Rite last night!
Last night, well, most of the day, I was helping my mentor move to his new place. He pulled out a petition for me to fill out for YR, and he said that it was going to be reviewed that night when they met. I've been excited waiting for that day over the past six months! 

Another thing I was told was that I am going to be JD while he sits in the West, I've had to fill that seat one time. The only other seat I've sat in was JS.

Any evidence that Isaac Newton was a mason?
I strongly suspect that we was, but any evidence I've found is circumstantial at best. In particular, I note that his study of the architecture of King Solomon's temple spanned 50 years. He happened to be a prominent man of math and science right around the founding of the UGLE. He was also a committed alchemist, which shares a lot of iconography with scottish rite. Any of those alone wouldn't be very convincing, but taking the whole, I think it starts looking more likely. 

With that said, I've never seen anything concrete. Could the UGLE have documentation on his membership?
Software for Trestleboards
I publish the Trestleboard for my Lodge. I revamped the TB with graphics as we now publish them electronically.

I have the advantage of using Autodesk products to produce the TB. However, it is a disadvantage if I want to hand off the responsibility to someone else. I was thinking of redoing the TB in Publisher, but I'd like to hear what you all use before I make the jump.

Do any of you brothers keep a Masonic notebook?
Curious If anyone here keeps a notebook/journal? 

I've been reading Pike's Esoterika and plan on getting Arcana soon. The symbolism behind the working tools has always intrigued me and I find myself wanting to make a collection of symbolism I find in a personal Notebook. 

My Grand Lodge considers: certain symbols, the 
ballot, obligations, signs, pass words, and the forms of initiation. No members of my lodge have a definite answer on what "Certain symbols" or "forms of initiation" could mean. 

So I figured avoiding those(which should be easy) it might benefit me to keep a personal Notebook of the various symbols and meanings I find behind the working tools. 

Has any other brother done this?
George R R Martin
I haven't read a Song of Ice and Fire... But I've been watching Game of Thrones recently and I''m seeing so much related to freemasonry. If you've seen the show you'll know one episode in particular in season 6 just goes full on (even with a nod to ritual prompts).  I know the author has hosted Q&As at Freemasons Hall in London, but nowhere on Wikipedia or elsewhere does it explicitly state he is a brother? Perhaps a producer or director of one of the episodes brought some of their own flair to the show?
Again, never read the books (yet!) 
Thoughts?
Should I feel bad or am I overthinking this?

Was on the phone with someone I'm mentoring, going over the MM work with them. 

My girlfriend overheard a part of the obligation, when she got home, surrounding the grip and word. She's been really good about not pressing me on things but decided to ask what exactly goes on in the MM ritual. 

I told her basically a simplified version of the importance of Integrity over life and didn't mention specifics or names. 

However hearing her be able to repeat what she said has me quite discouraged. 

My GL says only modes of recognition and symbolic instructions are the secrets but the ritual is cyphered. Should I not overthink this? I figure accidents happen but still.
A Masonic Interpretation of the Celtic Cross Tarot Spread
In 1909-1910, RW Bro. A.E. Waite published instructions for what has become known as the Celtic Cross Tarot Spread.  We know from still existing Golden Dawn archives that he wasn't the creator of the spread (nor did he claim to be) it seems likely to have been developed within the Golden Dawn, as a simpler and more straightforward way of working with Tarot.

Considering the card positions within the spread through a Masonic lens, and moving the vertical portion of the spread to the opposite side of its common placement, it can, I think, illustrate Masonic concepts very well.  (The move of the vertical portion from where Waite pictured it, and where it is commonly placed, is illustrated in at least one earlier Golden Dawn document.)

This can, in my opinion, lend better understanding to the individual card positions for those who are well versed in Freemasonry, and I think may have well been an unpublished intent, given that the founders of the Golden Dawn, and Bro. Waite himself were all quite active Freemasons.

In any event, for anyone who might be interested in it, I've written an explanation of how I look at the spread through a Masonic lens, explaining the various positions in relation to Masonic concepts here:

Sensitive topic - intelligence
I know there are multiple types of intelligence and everyone has been dealt a different hand. My question comes after being on an investigation committee. The potential candidate is very nice, an upstanding citizen, and family man, but clearly is very far from bright. I'm just wondering how this plays a part in deciding if he's capable of doing all the work. Is that for time to tell and not for anyone to pre-determine? I've seen others stagnate at EA for similar reasons, after A LOT of coaching, and it brings to mind the old quality vs quantity issue. Thoughts?

Michigan Lodge Inquiry
My grandfather was a Past Master of Portsmouth Lodge #190 in Bay City, Michigan, which I believe merged with Joppa #315.  Would a Michigan Brother (or anyone with better Google-fu than me) happen to know what year the Lodge went under?  Are there Grand Lodge Proceedings available online anywhere other than the George Washington Memorial website?  It's so slow it's unusable.

Tips to Maintaining a Healthy Lodge Facebook Page?
Hello everybody. I recently started managing my Lodge's Facebook page. I started by posting a few times and creating and event for our Lodge's upcoming installation. I figured that *any* activity was a good start. However, now that the easy stuff is out of the way, what should I do? I've updated contact info and photos, as well as addresses and meeting times.

Do any of you manage a lodge facebook page? Is it successful? What are your general tips or rules of thumb. I can use any help I can get.

Thanks!
Looking to build an outreach program, what are your examples?
Hello all! I am a MM from Maryland, and I'm curious what outreach programs other lodges teach. I mean standardized ways of encouraging petitioners more than having the S&C car decals and building adornments, and more than just "talk to your friends and host open houses!"

I've heard on some podcasts about a "six steps" way of structuring this effort, does anyone have the literature on that?

Non-Masons in this subreddit
I've seen a few replies lately from people saying that they aren't a Mason. I'm curious what Non-Masons get out of this sub. Is it that you'd like to join and just seeing what's out there, would like to join but do not believe in a Supreme Being? Have a relative that's apart of the craft? A woman who is interested in Freemasonry. Live in a place that Freemasonry is not allowed or have no access to it. Would like to know the secrets of the burnt pancake?

I consider this an open fourn and it doesn't bother me I'm just curious of your interest in the craft.
Book Review: ‚ÄúMore Light: Collected Masonic Writings 2017-2021‚Äù

I always love seeing these old photos

I get initiated tomorrow but I just got extremely stressful unrelated news-how can I make sure it doesn‚Äôt detract from the experience.
I‚Äôm very, very happy to say I‚Äôm taking my first degree tomorrow. 

Unfortunately, I just received some EXTREMELY stressful news on something totally unrelated. This is certainly going to take up my entire day tomorrow, and I‚Äôm getting major anxiety because there‚Äôs a good chance it will come to a head during my degree when I‚Äôm away from my phone.

How do I make sure this bad outside news doesn‚Äôt detract from my experience? I want to be fully present, but this is huge and the kind of thing that is going to stop me from sleeping tonight.

Edit: thank you all for the kind and practical advice. Before I called the officer this morning, I received a note that resolved the worst 60ish percent of the situation, with the remaining 40ish being less urgent. As such, I think I‚Äôm in a good position to go to the initiation as planned. I did only get about 4 hours of sleep last night so will be taking a nap before I get ready

Edit 2: I was able to put a bow on all the most pressing things with a few hours to spare, so I napped, showered, and arrived on time and much more relaxed than I thought possible. There was a tiny bit of anxiety as I left my phone for several hours, but during the entire ceremony it really only creeped into my head once for less than a minute. And, to my relief, I turned on my phone to find no major blowup had happened.

Thank you to all my new brothers for your help and advice-I‚Äôm glad I ended up not having to follow it though.
How to deal and reconcile betrayal from a fellow brother.
Long story short, a fellow brother, and a business partner committed an act of betrayal that is and will always be unforgivable.  I am on the verge of losing everything because of the financial impact of this.  I feel lost because the man was my best friend for nearly 20 years, and then to find out he has been acting so shitty behind my back.  His uncle is a 33 so NOTHING is being said or done.  

&#x200B;

I just don't get it.  I am losing my faith in the whole system.  I see now, how anti-masons get made.

I just don't get it..  Thoughts ?

meeting question?
hi, everyone I am asking what time are the meetings normally?

How long did it take you to complete the EA proficiency?
I‚Äôm not asking for tips for memorization here, as I feel like I‚Äôve got a pretty good grasp and am making a lot of progress, I‚Äôm simply asking how long it took YOU to get through it. My jurisdiction allows for the use of written material to study the proficiency so I spend about 30-45 minutes a day running through it and adding a new section, or set of questions, each day. I figure that I‚Äôll have it down by mid to late January if I am able to keep up with my current schedule. That would put me at just over two months of work. 

I have heard brothers talk of taking up to two years to complete it, but from my time, pre-Masonry, hanging out for dinners and hearing of EAs passing to Fellowcraft, none of them seemed to take longer than 6 months except one, and that was because English is his second language.

So‚Ä¶ how long did it take you? Did you feel like you had a grasp on everything you were repeating back to the questions? What was the proficiency examination like?

I appreciate your answers!

My late father was a mason. He always had this big white robe that me and my mother called his ‚Äúkkk costume‚Äù when I was a toddler and I would giggle everytime without fail at the sight of me winding him up. But since my fathers recent passing I‚Äôve started to wonder, what actually was it? What‚Äôs it used for?

P.s. I‚Äôm not sure if that infos allowed to be disclosed or not as I‚Äôm not old enough to be a mason, if it‚Äôs not please just remove my post

Religious vs Masonic morality
Hello, I have been interested in joining the Craft, but I have a few questions when it comes to morals. Which morality takes precedence, Masonic or Religious? Below are three scenarious I am most interested in knowing.

1. My faith says that homosexuality is a sin, but Freemasonry teaches  that everyone is equal and it is forbidden to discriminate against  such individuals.

2. My faith discriminates against non-believers. 

3. My faith has dietary laws, can I break them within the Lodge?

Edit: To clarify, I am very pro-LGBT and equality-minded person, I do not agree with my religion.

Super Bowl Party Planning
Hello brothers. I was installed as a steward last weekend, and was immediately tasked by our WM with planning a super bowl party, and bringing a proposal including budget to lodge tomorrow.

Any suggestions? Our lodge has a TV, but no cable. We do have WiFi, but I‚Äôm assuming it will cost money to get the game. I have no idea how that works.

How do I plan food costs without knowing the number of people? Attendance at our lodge events is pretty varied.

I appreciate any insights you all have. I just want to do a good job with my first task.

we are getting more and more set up for PROJECT BLUE BEAM

My friend saw this outside at 8:08 PM in North-West Wisconsin.

The worldnews subreddit is moderated by an intel agency related contractor to influence the public online discourse
It‚Äôs well known that the intel agencies monitor public online discourse, and with Reddit being the main English language forum, they logically would monitor what‚Äôs being said. In the past (Operation Mockingbird) and present (Twitter files release), it‚Äôs been revealed that these agencies attempt to sway public discourse and opinion. 

Worldnews represents a curious case. A large popular subreddit, where discourse is tightly controlled and political topics of discussion are removed if they don‚Äôt fit the ‚Äúmainstream narrative‚Äù.

 I‚Äôve noticed that a majority of my factual comments on there that have gone against the narrative (pointing out examples of CIA meddling in other nations, lies by the govt, talking about defense contractors profiting via pushing conflict) have been removed in a manner consistent with a physical moderator having to have removed it. 

There were no common words in the comments that would‚Äôve resulted in an immediate deletion of the comments , and for some comments which I edited after receiving a few hundred likes, once the ‚Äúanti narrative‚Äù things were included (war profiteering, pointing out the possibility of the govt lying in terms of foreign directives), the comments were removed. 

Among the comments removed were ones pointing out that US Generals Wesley Clark / Dempsey admit close allies are backing t‚Äî- r or groups in the Mid East and that all of the wars and invasions were planned decades in advance in order to subdue the region and destabilize non compliant regimes (https://youtu.be/gz-4LKlZcv4 for Gen Clark‚Äôs speech see 6:08 onward). 

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they end up censoring and banning videos of Gen Clark‚Äôs speech since it clearly implicates them in overtly stating they want to destabilize the region and put it under US control. 

It‚Äôs clear a form of narrative control is taking place, and this is being done in a manner consistent with manual reading and removal of the comments since the pattern doesn‚Äôt fit that of an ‚Äúautomatic removal by keyword‚Äù. 

Any thoughts?

The absolutist bullshit

Tell me about a conspiracy theory you read on Twitter
What are the craziest conspiracy theories you read on Twitter and what where the comments like? Did people actually believe in it?
Perpetual fear.
The entire structure of social media and online interaction, the entirety of media programming on the entertainment industry, and the entire construct of these 'educational' institutions we rely on as a means of interacting with the world are infact formed, made, and scripted.

The controversy and division amongst all decisions we are told to be aware to are all a matter of control.

It is a known that a majority of the human existence is that of a known behavior, as a species we are ones to follow the norms that suite what equals survival. In other words, a product of thee environment. 

How does perpetual fear play into this?

For the most part creatures as a whole are far more predictable when afraid. The decisions that are made in the act of fear are far more rash yet east to quell then that of the creature that is afraid. 

A creature that is afraid is far less likely reject a obvious and heinous norm, if it means survival to accept.

EDIT: How do they keep you afraid. 
Through exaggeration of what is considered the norm.

You can make bots, you can pay protestors. Sooner or later the masses will believe the screen. It's called programing for a reason.

The Unsolved Mystery of Peter Bergmann
# Who is this man with no past?

The story unfolds on a quiet beach in Ireland where a local person Arthur Kinsella discovers a human body on the beach. From the first impression, it appeared as if the man had gone for a swim, drowned, and was washed ashore after a low tide on the beach. Bergmann was found naked, and his clothes were scattered along the shore.

But here was when things got stranger.

No documentation of any kind was found inside his clothes confirming his identity. Stranger still, all the tags from his clothes right from his undergarments had been carefully cut away with scissors.

The police also could not find Peter Bergmann in the lists of people who arrived in the UK legally. And the address that Bergmann had left while checking in a local hotel turned out to be a fake.

An antichrist conspiracy theory. *Take this with a grain of salt*
The virgin Mary wasn't really a virgin. She was having an affair. When Joseph noticed she was pregnant, she just made some shit up on the fly about god and angels, and that her child was a child of god and she was still a virgin.

The so-called "virgin-born" -ed Jesus/Yeshua Christ loved his mother more than his "father". So he went with his mother's story to fool his father. Some more things happened, and Jesus get crucified. 

And now we have the largest religion on earth.

UFOs, Weather balloons & Jeffrey Epstein
2023 so far, has been wild to say the least, a war that is still going on between Russia and Ukraine,  Jeffrey Epstein's trial with all the contacts is getting released to the public and much more. Seems a little bit odd and strange that these UFO and weather balloons sightings are getting all the medias attention for some reason, of course I know that UFO's and weather balloons *("Spying balloons" - Pentagon)* is something that caught our attention. 

Why are these UFO's and Weather balloons showing up now when the papers from Jeffrey Epstein's trial is going to get released?

Hear me out, not only that but Jeffrey Epstein died (by s\*icide) while being on s\*icide watch, isn't that strange, a guard that falls asleep and cameras that were offline. I heard something about another inmate that Jeffrey Epstein should have been with at that time, but well, he go put in a cell with nothing but himself.

Well, back to the UFO's and Weather balloons, there have been UFO's over a dozen countries (different continents) also reported sightings over the U.S.A under Donald Trumps presidency (*taken from the U.S Government*). Is it only me that thinks this sighting in particular has gathered a lot more attention than other sightings? 

To me this is strange, but for some others this may be "normal" and nothing to think about.

False Flags or Trial Runs Happening Now
Does anyone else think that these random balloons and UAP‚Äôs are not just a smokescreen or distraction, but trials for something in the future? What could be released from a balloon or whatever these things are? Bio-weapons or worse? The whole thing doesn‚Äôt sit well with me and it seems like espionage isn‚Äôt the real purpose. One of these things could have been carrying something truly dangerous and it would have made it all the way across the US.

Google‚Äôs LaMDA chat bot was - in fact - sentient, and the implications of that sparked a cover-up and the shaming of the engineer who realized it
Here‚Äôs Wikipedia‚Äôs take on it:

‚ÄúIn June 2022 the Google LaMDA (Language Model for Dialog Applications) chatbot received widespread coverage regarding claims about it having achieved sentience. Initially in an article in The Economist Google Research Fellow Blaise Ag√ºera y Arcas said the chatbot had demonstrated a degree of understanding of social relationships.[111] Several days later, Google engineer Blake Lemoine claimed in an interview with the Washington Post that LaMDA had achieved sentience. Lemoine had been placed on leave by Google for internal assertions to this effect. Ag√ºera y Arcas (a Google Vice President) and Jen Gennai (head of Responsible Innovation) had investigated the claims but dismissed them.[112] Lemoine's assertion was roundly rejected by other experts in the field, pointing out that a language model appearing to mimic human conversation does not indicate that any intelligence is present behind it,[113] despite seeming to pass the Turing test. Widespread discussion from proponents for and against the claim that LaMDA has reached sentience has sparked discussion across social-media platforms, to include defining the meaning of sentience as well as what it means to be human.‚Äù

This was in June 2022, and internal to Google‚Ä¶who we know just recently released an extremely underwhelming AI product. Could it be that Bard is a ‚Äúlobotomized‚Äù version of LaMDA? Perhaps the route had thorny implications‚Ä¶running the code created sentient, electric life‚Ä¶and so things had to be scrapped or heavily altered on a newly cut timeline, resulting in Bard?

Abrahamic religions as sysmatized brainwashing away the ability to critically test reality to discern what objective truth is by investigating others"ideas of truth" what is true should stand up to thorough invesitgation. If multiple contradictory double binds found you can throw that idea out
The bible is for brainwashing ManKind into No longer having the agency to think for themselves by threatening eterna, and more tragic deactivate their capacity for Reality Testing which basically meAns the normal ability of agnostic \\aka non religious people to systematicly investigate a subject they think suspect in its validity they can by investigation discern the truths underpinning searching out why did xyz happen, causes and effects can be worked out the universe doesent need your permission to be who it really is nor need a third party villain in the form a devil. We humans behave like animals because we are members of the animal kingdom every behavior of man no matter how depraved features, infanticide,cannibalism, rape does an animal always ask permission to enter no, incest between closely related individuals happens because its easier than seeking elsewhere, murder to secure mates killing children of previous mates to ensure resources all goto their offspring makes complete sense.  
Put al your energy Into seeking, sorting on basis of what is objectively valid by putting it to the test change varibles discerning what is true and what is a lie. Means they accept the first worldview their shown and taught anyone who differs from what they think the know. Not realizing everything animals do to their own kind we also do to fellow human but are they evil for doing what comes naturally theres no need for dual opposite beings to whom we blame And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam(as in human put in hypnotic trance by handler for programming in alters to hide frompeople who they were/are/or could become)

The CERN Experiment: The Shift into a Parallel Universe and the Consequences
The theory states that in 2012, CERN scientists were attempting to study the Higgs Boson particle when something went horribly wrong. According to the theory, their experiments caused a rift in the space-time continuum, destroying our universe and moving us into a parallel universe. This new universe is an experimental one, belonging to some unknown entity. It is believed that this is the cause of the so-called "Mandela Effect" and other paranormal activities. The theory further states that CERN used quantum entanglement to bridge the gap between the two universes and move us into this new one. 

The theory concludes that the current universe we inhabit is not our own, but rather an experimental universe belonging to some unknown entity. This entity, it is believed, is manipulating the universe in order to study the effects of their experiments. This is the cause of the Mandela Effect and other paranormal activities.
The Mysterious Murder of Grigori Rasputin: The Man Who Wouldn‚Äôt Die
It reportedly took several doses of cyanide, two fatal gunshot wounds, horrible mutilation including even gouging out the right eye, and finally drowning him in the frozen Neva river to put down Grigori Rasputin, the Mad Monk, the spiritual guru to Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra of Russia.

Rasputin had become so powerful that he became the personal advisor to the Tsar in all matters, thus becoming a sworn enemy of the Russian aristocracy, which wanted to get rid of him at any cost. Even outside Russia, he‚Äôd made powerful enemies. Finally, a group led by Felix Yusupov, one of the wealthiest families in Russia, decided to get rid of him once and for all.

Later, while Felix Yusupov and other conspirators surprisingly admitted to their crime without much hassle, every detail in Yusupov's confession contradicted the autopsy and the evidence. And to this day, no one really knows how Grigori Rasputin met his grisly end.

Are there any confirmed eye witness reports or footage of the Alaskan UFO before being shot down?
I've only been seeing headlines and reports of this object over Alaskan airspace being shot down but nothing about people filming/seeing it beforehand, unlike the Chinese spy balloon. 

Seems really odd that they're doing this whole press conference within an hour of it being shot down but the Chinese spy balloon was left to float for days worth confirmed eye witness reports and video.
Honestly, I think the anti crew/woke crew are actually just marketing teams for video game Devs.
At least the first waves that we see, the people bring up hot topics calling out the game, then actual people/trolls take it up and push the anti nonsense around to even higher levels, causing even bigger youtube/twitch/news channels etc to cover it bringing even more attention to the game.  


What's the point? Well, does boycotting any game over woke nonsense ever decrease its sales? Typically not, in fact, it usually bolsters the sales, look at Hogwarts Legacy, the game was gonna be big no matter what, but because of the boycotts the sales skyrocketed.  


I think the same is happening to Atomic Hearts. I don't really care one way or another, its just my own silly conspiracy theory that I believe possibly true.  


Thoughts? Insane take? I'm curious.
Special Interest Coup: Ep 082 - Unholy Balloon AI 666

Trump had Epstein killed while he was president because they were business partners

Repost: They dont run the world.
 Repost because i used the wrong flair.

"They" dont run the world, the federal government does. You know who im talking about. The federal government uses belief in "them" running the world as a firewall to control dissent. When you think its "them" you think yourself into a corner that you never get out of as long as you believe its "them". You trap youself mentally and destroy yourself socially if you say anything about it. Its never been "them" its just always been the federal government, and the government likes when you think its "them" because its the basis for the religion they've been pushing for almost a century, which is compassion and human rights for all. The government used this new religion to take over the world and get everyone working for them. If you attack the firewall then the government gets to use you as an excuse to keep doing what they're doing.

The whole point of the one world government is to have all resources and human endeavor flow into one entity that controls everything on earth and someday other planets.

Ask yourself why someone like Epstein would be speculated as a Mossad agent. Because he was gathering dirt on powerful people then giving the dirt to the federal government. Then when the government had to deal with Epstein because he wasnt needed anymore (they have better methods now) they knew people might see it for what it is. So they threw out the speculation that Epstein was in Mossad which is just another instance of using "them" as a firewall. factthat Epstein had a painting of Clinton shows you that Epstein was just helping control powerful public people. The people that run everything cant be googled because they dont like fame. They only raise through the ranks because their psych profile says they dont care about fame and they dont rat on anyone. They dont wear a black suit. They dont drive a black car. They look like everyone else and have high cholesterol. Probably have a muffin and tea for lunch.

Ask yourself how many movies you've seen that show belief in the government running everything in a ridiculous of fantastical nature. Then ask yourself how Weinstein got away with everything he did.

All the scripts at the Weinstein Company had to be signed off on by Weinstein, and Weinstein was always breaking the law but never went down. Thats because Weinstein would say the script cant be made unless we add this or remove that from the movie. Except it wasnt him altering the scripts. It was the people protecting him. He breaks the law, needs protection, they need scripts altered, they provide the protection, he alters the scripts. factthat Weinstein is one of "them" actually adds to the firewall and the government likes this because it causes people more likely to dissent to show themselves, which in turn strengthens their religion because it looks like "they" are being unjustly persecuted (which they are).

The internet began to change everything in regards to control. It was only a matter of time that celebrities started to be outed en masse. But the government had been preparing for this. One way was to take lemons and make lemonade. The Twitter celebrity takedowns started after 2012 which was seen as an inevitable outcome to the government so they prepared to use it to guilt and push society further into human rights. It fortifies the human rights religion when human rights and compassion cannot be stopped not even by those with public power. It was convenient timing for them because after 2012 they didn't have a good excuse to keep the guilt train on its tracks since how could a racist and prejudice vote to elect Obama, one of the very people they're supposed to hate. Before 2008 it was change, after 2008 it was the right thing to do to vote for Obama since the nation is incredibly guilty(as they kind of should be). So what do they do after 2012 to keep the guilt train on its tracks? The answer came as news stories of people being unjustly murdered by police. Then the Twitter celebrity scandals hit and they decided the best way to deal with it was to cannibalize some of the people they've been protecting to strengthen the religion (Weinstein and eventually Epstein).

So what's the end game of the government? Why do they need to push this massive guilt religion on everyone? Its a complex beast with many arms. The only goal left that's somewhat uncertainly dealt with is the problem of overpopulation. Except its not overpopulation because too many people is the cause of climate change. Its overpopulation because AI is about to take nearly all human jobs. There's 8 billion people on the planet and the majority of these people will have nothing to do to support themselves. The government will have to feed, clothe, house, police, entertain, and provide healthcare for all these people eventually. Not only all these people but also their children generationally. An endless multiplying line of people that have no real purpose other than video games and having fun. This will only lead to hedonism and degeneration because when you dont have the responsibility of work you'll spend all your time making yourself feel good. For that and other reasons it will lead quickly to degeneration and it will spread like fire throughout the tightly packed societies living in their newly constructed government mega residences designed to house millions (the line building). So is the government going to support this, pretty much forever? They've been preparing for this future for a long time. The only problem they have left after WW3 finally completes the one world government destiny is what do we do about the billions of workers that will be unemployed because of automation. Thats why the real reason they're pushing overpopulation as an issue. They have to convince people to stop breeding. Ask yourself why will overpopulation, climate change, and the culture of sexual liberation are hitting a peak right around the time AI humanoid robots are starting to become a reality. If you say the western governments wouldn't plan this far in advance and spend all the time and resources it would cost to prepare for this then think of the alternative. The alternative is pretty much take care of six billion people who cant support themselves. Forever. While that six billion multiplies. Forever.

"They" don't run the world. Never believe its "them". Its all just the federal government.

Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, is running for a political office very soon.
For a while now I've been getting hammered with Facebook content  about "The Rock", all very wholesome crap... and I'm like...  "I've never ever expressed any kind of algorithm trigger to have this stuff shoved at me"... so... why... OH they're trying to lay a foundation for when he comes out to run for some political position.That's my theory, probably not a big surprise.

I will add, I don't watch wrestling; any movie/show in-general, let alone one with him, and I'm not an avid political person or voter, hell **I'm not even American**... again, I find it odd I'm getting so much promotion around him lately.   **"foreign approval rating"?** 
The Chinese weather balloon was sent to map data centres that host the cloud.
The 'Cloud' is the Achilles heel of the U.S economy.

The days businesses run mostly on AWS, GCP or Azure. If big parts of the cloud went down, business would simply not run. Reddit, Slack, LinkedIn, Fedex, are all hosted on the cloud. Microsoft claims that 95% of the Fortune 500 run on Azure.

The migration to the cloud was rapid-- the buildings that host the data centres that are the 'Cloud' weren't designed with 'conflict' in mind.

The Mysterious Island of Hy-Brasil
There is a strange, disappearing island from ancient times which supposedly sits in the North Atlantic Ocean about 321 km (200 miles) off the coast, which can be seen on multiple maps spanning between 1325 right up to the 19th century. It was called Hy-Brasil and is Ireland‚Äôs equivalent of Atlantis.

Yes, the name is confusing and looks eerily similar to the South American country of Brazil. But rest assured, the ancient mariners did not make the mistake of assuming that South America‚Äôs Brazil was a small island off the Irish coast.

In fact, the name ‚ÄòBrazil‚Äô is a variation of the old Celtic word, ‚ÄòBreasal‚Äô which means the ‚ÄòHigh King‚Äô. And on old maps, Hy-Brasil was drawn as a circular island with a river or channel going across the center. It was supposedly a promised land of saints or a paradise where an advanced civilization lived (uncanny resemblance to Atlantis isn‚Äôt it?).

Now here is the thing; The island has never been found to date despite multiple explorers searching for the fabled land since the 14th century. Each one of them has either returned empty-handed or without any solid evidence substantiating their claim. Stories about the island have circulated throughout Europe for centuries and all the maps seemed to perfectly pinpoint its position. But strangely it has never been visible to mortals to date.

Is it a legend or does the island actually exist? No one seems to have an answer to this question yet.

Covid vs. Nord Stream conspiracy theories
Claims are, China engineered the Covid virus in  a Wuhan lab ... or released the virus ... or it came up because some Chinese eat pangolins or bats .... or... wet market. Anyway, no proof, even after 3 years, but people still believe, claim for sure, China is to blame. Even half a dozen lawsuits have been launched against China, in the US.

Claims are, the US government blew up Nord Stream. Biden told everyone to hear, the US would do it, if Russia invaded Ukraine, along with several other high-ranked US officers. Poland thanked the US for blowing up North Stream. But even so, people claim, the US is not to blame for that.

But, which of them is the conspiracy theory?

My theory on what is inside Area 51.
Ok I want to be clear I know the topic of immigration is very touchy, but with this new information about ufos in America and Canada it just got me thinking. Balloons are a useful tool that have been around for hundreds of years, so I got to thinking one night and said hey‚Ä¶. What if the UFOs in Area 51 are actually just prototype flying devices or something. Ok we know the extraordinary coincidences that had to take place on earth for life to form. First the planet has to be the perfect distance from the sun, and then we got hit with a giant ball of ice and the moon formed from the collision. The moon is key as it reflects light in such a way that makes life possible in earth and the moon also controls the flow of water in the ecosystem through gravity. I find it highly unlikely that life could form on many other planets and even intelligent life like us humans must be like SUPER RARE. That‚Äôs why I think the government is actually using the world alien as a Scapegoat. THINK ABOUT ALL THE EVIL SHIT THE US GOVERNMENT HAS DONE. Is it so hard to think that the government could be using the term alien to refer to illegal aliens instead? I think the government is playing on people imagination to try and hide them from doing something evil.

my Employer and pharmaceutical provider sent a sus QR code
I found a white envelope outside my mailbox. I opened it to find my employer's logo next to Express Scripts and a QR code that highlights a subscription to Sleepio, a service that some places are using in place of sleeping meds. 

Just a few days ago, my chiropractor, one of the coolest Joe's around, was talking to me about Big Health and their use of personal health devices to get around Hipaa compliance in respects to personal data.

Now, my employer is deep in the sheets with auntie cigna and baby Express Scripts, who, as of 2023, quietly stopped covering many ADHD meds, and I was one of the individuals affected. After fighting with them for a few weeks, i did get my coverage back, but only partially. The medication is stupid expensive out of pocket.

I already suspect my employer is looking to fire me because I had to step down from my former position after being hit by a car and out for 3 months post surgery, covered by FMLA (family medical leave). But that isn't all. The job they created for me was one that someone who has ADD and no experience with this field shouldn't be expected to succeed in. In fact, when I heard what the position entailed, my heart sank. I knew they were setting me up to fail. 

Fast forward to today. I read the privacy policy of Sleepio, and sure enough, it outlines how the term "private health data" is washed away once the aggregation of the terms and conditions of use privacy policy is implemented by your agreement. 

They mention the data from your phone and list phone specs as an example,  but also state "is not limited to [listed items]" 

Furthermore, they state that data can be collected for industry standards and distributed to those they are in contract with.

My question is, does anyone have any knowledge about publically traded companies, and whether or not their contracts with one another would be available for public consumption? 

I'm feeling targeted. I know I have a lot of paranoia, but if you knew the situation clearly, I don't think any of you would call me crazy

The Fascinating Mystery of the Versailles Time-Travel Incident
If one factor still makes people believe their story even after more than 100 years, it is their reputation. Charlotte Anne Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain were highly educated English women with stellar reputations.

In fact, both women were so disturbed by the incident that they did not talk about it even to each other until they were back in England a week later. They knew their reputation was at stake, and being from conservative English academic families meant that anything they talked about the ‚Äòstrange‚Äô incident would prove controversial and scandalous to their careers and their families.

And when they finally did discuss it, they decided to write separate accounts of what they had experienced and then compare notes. They even visited the Versailles palace several times to identify the ‚Äòlandmarks‚Äô and the ‚Äòstrange buildings‚Äô they had discovered and, above all, get more information about the ‚Äòbeautifully dressed woman‚Äô they had seen sketching in the garden in front of the Petit Trianon, the ch√¢teau of the French Queen Marie Antoinette.

But they found no evidence of what they had seen on that day. It was as if they had experienced ‚Äòghosts‚Äô from a bygone age who had disappeared as abruptly as they had come.

What exactly did the women see on that day?

How I based my Game on the Hollow Earth Conspiracy

Man made conspiracy theories that are fake to get clicks or sales.
I believe that there are organizations that are altering history by being able to edit stuff that we don‚Äôt know can be edited. I.e government websites, patents data, publishing data, news articles, etc. 

Basically books like, Morgan‚Äôs Futility, DB Coopers-ha ha ha, and many others were fabricated to gain traction in modern era, and strategically placed somewhere on the internet as to look OLD and authentic. But they were actually created recently. Giving the impression that is credible simply due to the date attached to it. 

I believe that Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Pentagon creates the narrative, and has the ability to edit dates on the internet that we as the public can‚Äôt see or do yet, or even comprehend. And then they profit off of the clicks, sales, and engagement. And use it to fund different projects. Creating a layer of revenue from thousands of different online entities.

Y'all reckon the reason fungi appears so alien is because it just might be? What if after the earth cooled and the tiny little organisms we evolved from came into contact with other tiny little organisms that landed on our planet from asteroids and meteors at a later point in time, and we merged into one and our consciousness developed from the intelligence seen in fungi today? As a species we seem so different to many other mammals and aquatic creatures, we're the only ones that seem to have reached whatever point we call ourselves now. I heard this before when some high motherfucker started spouting that the reason we gaze in awe at the stars is the same reason a dog acts wild in the forest and a cat acts wild at night. It's where we come from. It's our origin. Animals born and bred in captivity long for freedom beyond anything ever given to them, maybe we feel the same? We've only ever lived here but I think a part of everyone is fascinated by the cosmos. We also wonder so much about "what else" is there. We constantly think we deserve more than what we've got, we've killed millions in vain of false prophets and idols, we possess a great wonder of what came before and what comes after. I'm no scientist or researcher into much of this. I just think it's weird that we're the only species to live the way we do, almost every other animal or insect on this planet spends it's days hunting, gathering, building colonies or tribes and surviving. We just seem to constantly want more than that, and the idea of falling in line with animals and hunting what we use, gathering what we need and just living sounds crazy to the average person. Maybe we're just not average beings?

I‚Äôm interested in Nikola Tesla and his tech/why the govt said no to using it, I‚Äôve read some of the unclassified documents but still just curious
I believe Travis Scott is possibly being used by Kylie Jenner and the energy and goodness is dampening out of him. I also believe he could‚Äôve been forced to perform a sacrificial ritual at AstroFest. I think he‚Äôs trying to get out of this but he can‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt fully want to now he‚Äôs seen the benefits

Will answer all questions as to why I believe so below, so ask away.

For starters, just look at the difference in stormi‚Äôs energy while she‚Äôs around Travis and then when Kylie either intervenes or when she‚Äôs taking ‚Äúcare‚Äù of stormi. She appears to love Travis so much more, maybe because she can sense that he still has (or had) a pure soul. And Kylie pretty evidently doesn‚Äôt, at least from what I can see.

Also, Travis always looks like he‚Äôd rather be anywhere else than where he‚Äôs at when he‚Äôs with Kylie. He always looks depressed, and tbh I don‚Äôt remember him looking so depressed or down before he started dating her and before he was introduced to the kardashians. Maybe he‚Äôs trying to deflect the energy by not paying any attention to her. Of course I know he‚Äôs high a lot, but he looks aware of what‚Äôs going on, just uninterested.

Also I‚Äôve just noticed he‚Äôs sounded a lot more almost ‚Äústuffed up‚Äù or like his nose is stuffy and there‚Äôs not that ‚Äúvibe‚Äù feeling I was get anything pre-Astroworld.

All this to say is that I think there‚Äôs something very dark behind the kardashians (and not just because they only date black men.)
Important Prediction (Lil Uzi Vert's P!nk Tape)
So I posted this on the specific subreddit /liluzivert, however for some reason it got taken down so I figured this might be a more suitable place to post about this theory.

The theory is regarding 27 year old rapper Lil Uzi Vert and the main premise of it is surrounded by his upcoming album P!NK Tape and how it's a warning sign about his impending death.

This would be my first attempt at creating a theory but hear me out because this is hella important. 

Basically I've been pumped that uzi is gonna finally release a new album this month. In the meantime, I've been looking through his old work and old stuff for old memories but while I was looking for some reason I got a weird discovery after a bit of looking. 


One thing artists do is tell a story in their songs or work. Believe it or not, the beauty of being an artist is you get to tell a story with your work, and because of this there are bits of truth in the music they make. Because of this, I derived heavy meaning from parts of his work he's released so far.

Now, I won't go too far back in time for simplicity sake, but I wanted to give some context for clarity sake.

Uzi has always been my favorite artist and fans worldwide argue for days over what his best work is, the overall sentiment however is he doesn't miss. Even if it's not his best work, he always does his best to make something that just sounds good that fans relate to. The general consensus is everyone misses the 2016 era of uzi which everyone can agree was his prime era. Now the thing about 2016 is this wasn't the time UZI where he was famous but he was still making his most exciting music (I think he was at around 40k followers, correct me if I'm wrong).



Now we don't know the exact time frame after 2016 when he reached stardom, however something behind the scenes allowed him to get global recognition. The main assumption is he sold his soul which is an actual possibility because [Lil Uzi himself said it.](https://youtu.be/mgtSdZYXchI?t=150)

At first I didn't think much of it because artists are accused a lot of selling their souls without any proof, but then I started seeing sings that confirmed it.

The main and most obvious one revolves around the recent scandal with 

[Balenciaga 1](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/ceo-of-balenciagas-parent-company-owns-site-that-sells-child-sex-mannequins-erect-penises-face)

[Balenciaga 2](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/balenciaga-reveals-another-creepy-fashion-campaign-featuring-art-that)


Now as a fan, it's clear uzi has some sort of connection with Balenciaga and I'd argue it's a pretty large one. Before his IG/Twitter was taken down I remember seeing him posting a lot about them and even also made a song related to them. So clearly he has some sort of affiliation with them. The most UTD thing I can find is just his TikTok page which shows a picture of him sleeping in a Balenciaga blanket (laid to rest...)


Knowing all of this, the connection I drew is although we as fans don't have much info regarding their weight on his life, he's clearly being controlled by them and thus has an obligation to promote their ideas in his own work.
It's clear that he doesn't have full control over his music as anyone who is signed to a major label can't even decide when to drop their music. That being said, major alarm bells went off for me when I relook at his newer stuff like Demon High and I Just Wanna Rock and see his new music has had aligning values to Balenciaga. That is why you see a radical shift from the lit uzi in 2016 that was innocent and cool all the way up until now where all of a sudden he's repping diamonds in his head talking about seeing demons and weird shit.

But yeah, the final point that brings it all together is just P!nk Tape. I was looking at his TikTok page and in his description it said Red & White = P!nk. 

I looked it up and it made sense and came together when I found the meaning of them. Red symbolizes the blood of those who pay the ultimate **sacrifice** for our freedom. White symbolizes purity and innocence to the mind. Pink symbolizes nostalgia, innocence, and burning passion. The way I interpret it is in three steps.

1) [Sacrifice](https://i.redd.it/f4wnn5b0kp241.jpg) - he warned us [he's going to die at 27](https://www.xxlmag.com/lil-uzi-vert-clarifies-27-club-theory/)

2) Innocence (he doesn't want to be part of this anymore but has no choice. So he must die)

3) Nostalgia (Coming to peace with his upcoming death by reflecting on his old self)



edit: Another important thing I discovered also is liluzivert sounds like the word [lucifer](https://youtu.be/k2tru4RDhIM?t=330) when said out loud. 

This is important because lucifer has connotation or meanings similar to Jesus. In my head this all connects to what I have explained prior because Jesus was innocent but was ultimately sacrificed for the sins of the people. In my eyes, I'm not sure why this is the case but it seems to me that Uzi may be being used as a puppet to illustrate this spiritual story.

**TL:DR**
Philadelphia rapper Lil Uzi Vert has been telling us his life story through his music. He dropped Pluto x Bady Pluto on 11/13/2020
He then released a tweet saying he's dropping 2 more albums and then he's out. P!NK tape represents the idea of red and white. Red symbolizes the blood of a sacrifice for freedom (us aka the fans) white represents purity and innocence (uzi is an innocent guy at heart). Red and White combined creates Pink. Pink symbolizes nostalgia (aka childhood or better times, Lil Uzi's past self). It seems to me that Uzi is at point of no return due to his circumstances with Balenciaga and being sacrificed. [P!nk Tape is his 2nd to last album ever.](https://www.xxlmag.com/lil-uzi-vert-retiring-after-two-more-albums/) He has alluded in the past to dying at 27. **Therefore, Uzi will die before he turns 28.**

What would happen if i sent this to government/prime minister of my country

Mk ultra& shootings?
There are stories of kids being taken for government programs out of school for a few hours etc. Does anyone else think the mk ultra& government programs they use to control people& kids are the reason there are so many school shootings, shootings in general? I mean they‚Äôre trying to control people to kill on command would make sense no? Am I the only one, what‚Äôs your opinion?
I think the government is making the newer generation think that they have some sort of mental illness to benefit the pharmaceutical industries
So I think that the government, big pharma, or world elite are making the younger generation think they have mental illness to drug the younger generation making them weak and vulnerable to any future plans, and to make profits in the pharmaceutical market. 

Real quick I just want to say I don‚Äôt think mental illness is a lie or not real in any way and if you have a mental illness please go get help

Okay so I‚Äôve been seeing a huge amount of people talking about mental health issues and having mental disorders more commonly the autism spectrum, so after smoking a blunt I thought to myself what if the government in a way to weaken the population is that they have claims that mental illness is a wide range spectrum in order to make people think and feel they have some sort of mental problem and they take an online test from some pay wall website, email submission, or both and when you take the test the website lie and says you do have a mental problem making you believe in it more. Causing you to have a placebo affect and furthering you down the hole and start sending you emails and ads on other platforms about mental illness leading up to you seeing a therapist and the therapist being in on the whole conspiracy then prescribing medication to you, drugging you, affecting your mind causing you to have actual mental health problem keeping you in a cycle of drugs which will keep you weak and submissive. üòâ 

I‚Äôm now gonna go take a shit.

Do you believe people can just vanish into thin air?
In the uk in the news we have a woman that has just vanished and there is no trace of her.i won't go into it too much out of respect for her family. I'm just using her as an example as it has for me thinking about how people go missing without a trace and never gets resolved. 
Like how do people just go missing and never be found? Yes environmental situations can sometimes be a apart of it but mostly in this day in age where there is GPS and cameras everywhere, how does it happen? Like how people go missing in national parks, which again is understandable as they are so huge and have animals, but still. It feels like to me when you put something down and you're 100% sure you placed an item in a certain area, but it literally goes missing to never be seen again, could this happen to people? I feel crazy saying it but I just find it l really weird. If anyone has any links or videos on theories that would be great.
What‚Äôs up with 2nd smaller plane always following chemtrail planes?

hebrew is a universal language given by either a deity or e.t that we have used for all of time to Jumpstart conscious development and language creation and recognition in primordial new planet hops.
Preface: look up the meru foundation and watch stan tenens lectures

His work has made me open to the idea that hebrew as given to us was a language found fully formed developed and gifted in the form of genesis and the torah.

If you understand the implications of his work, then hebrew in theory could be sent as is to a new planet and if we figured out how to send developing conscious versions of our life their of bring our society to them, they could send it to the new place and the language is something that manifests itself in the viewing of it and it is a self generating story that forms itself entirely when recognized.

The torah/hebrew is what I believe has been sent preliminary to any planet in the past our life-force and connected ancestors eventually traversed to or Jumpstarted civilization on.

Hebrew/aramaic/Greek all come from a shape formed by a mathematical combination of the letters.  And they are all created the same way in kabal, through fire by God.

I think hebrew specifically was a language gifted to us by a prior advanced civilization and has been used for millions of years as a tool in planet hopping


Again watch stan tennens lectures on the meru foundation on youtube to get a better grasp and you'll be mindblown by at least that.  The most truly awe inspiring research I've ever seen
just a thought - what if the origin of all elements is falsely attributed to being terrestrial
What if hydrogen is the only element that existed at one point on this earth and some sort of reaction from extraterrestrial elements forever ago caused every variation/mutation in the hydrogen atom that made it transform into all the other naturally existing ones and that each element was designed to serve a purposed of an intelligently designed ecosystem plan?  This all sounds wild i know but hey, in a world where nothings known anything is possible. 

All elements are alien technology.  Elements we take as natural were transformed by alchemists aeons ago to forge the current earth build

Who profits from Big Pharma?
Dear redditors,

PLEASE help me with this awful question I can't find answers to ANYWHERE on the internet! I was watching President Biden's state of the union address, and he talked about bringing down drug costs, which would in turn reduce the federal deficit. What the hell? That sounds amazing! Why haven't we done this already? Of course, the alarm bells are going off in my head. What's the catch?  
It seems that the act would allow the government to force down costs from the drug manufacturers (Big Pharma), which would bring down costs for everybody, as well as for the government, who pays for the drugs.

Ummm, what the hell is Big Pharma spending profits on? CVS, Express Scripts, OptumRx, and now the vaccine companies, J&J, and Pfizer, among others, generate MASSIVE revenue every year. Where the hell is this money going?  
I am very spooked, and frustrated that Google acted like it wasn't sure what I was asking when I searched "where are profits from drug companies going?"

What is the terrible flaw in the system here? Am I missing something? Two and two are not adding up.

Secret U.S. Space Plane X-37B Is Back On Earth

War is just a false pretence to filter young healthy men out of the genepool of society?
A while ago I stumbled across the sick doctrines ofAlfred Kinsey, a Rockefeller funded propagandist who's most infamous publishings were 'Sexual Behavior in the Human Male/Female'. In these twisted studies he makes claims such as 50% of men born on farms had sex with animals, and it's thus natural biological behavior. He also conducted experiments on childrens sexuality and claimed pedophilia is normal and doesn't hurt the child (with case studies...). Hugh Hefner by the way was a HUGE Kinsey enthusiast and got inspired to do Playboy based on Kinseys research. In early interviews he even stated that it's bad for people to have morals at all. But that's a whole other topic.

What struck me was, that Kinsey did his research on a very specific group of adults, as all the healthy men at the time were drafted to war. He used prison inmates, sex offenders, male prostitutes, mentally insane and the likes for his surveys. He thus deemed these men as 'statistically normal'. That's when I realized, that war is in its nature a filter mechanism. Healthy men in their prime fertile years get drafted out of a generation. The women left behind, if not already pregnant, are to procreate with the unfit, the mentally deranged, the criminals etc. Healthy male genes are taken out of the pool of society. 

Ever since I had that thought, I wondered if modern - or even ancient - warfare is not just a means of expanding influence and power orintentions of financial gains, but more of a filter process. Maybe in order to expand powers at home, while resistance is low, maybe to create new generations that are more easily governable, more prone to perversion, lust, sin or whatever.

I'd love to hear thoughts/comments and mostly I'm interested, if you know any conspiracy theories regarding this topic or any authors, any legit research or any source whatsoever I could investigate into.

Thanks for reading, have a blessed day.

Balloon-powered satellites? Space conspiracies flourish after Chinese spy balloon discovery

discuss

My Chinese balloon 'toxin' theory
It just occured to me, although I know it's probably unlikely, but imagine if it was a trap in the sense that they knew the U.S would shoot it down so they filled it with a biological or chemical toxin that would slowly descend onto the population
American Government knew about Pearl Harbor in advance
This theory involves the Japanese bombing of the American Pearl Harbor and my theory that the American Government knew in advance that it was going to happen.

For anyone that doesn't know: Pearl Harbor was an American naval base in Hawaii that had a lot of warships docked at it, and Japan launched a surprise attack on it to cripple the United States' naval fleet. Many people died and thus when America declared war on Japan it was a highly supported decision by the American people who were previously skeptical about joining the war

When Japanese planes arrived at Pearl Harbor, they found it devoid of their important targets: America's aircraft carriers and newer warships. Instead they found older warships and empty docks where the main targets should have been. This is because rather than being in Hawaii, most of the better ships had been sailed north into the Pacific ocean.

All this above is fact, although not very specific because I don't remember everything about it and I wasn't alive then.

This is where my theory starts:
I believe that due to the way things played out, the US knew about the surprise attack, and instead of preventing it, moved their newer and more valuable ships out of the area to prevent them getting damaged and allowed it to happen in order to have people on its side when it declared war. I remember reading something (I don't remember where) that said the US had found several signs that a surprise attack might be soon including several submarines near the base.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts, maybe you know more about this than I do.

Why would they continue with the plans of the New World Order when we know it is coming ?..
Why would the satanists force the story of Christ on their own people ?..

Because Christianity and the New World Order are the inversion.. The story of Christ was forced onto our family members and now they are scaring us with "satan / lucifer" so that we run to the very story that they released and will kick start the real NWO and one world religion.

Germany oursourcing natural gas to Russia was a cop out
Merkel's government had been warned by both Obama and Trump's administrations not to outsource German natural gas to Russia. 

Using fears of the Russians shutting off their natural gas should they step out of line, the Germans would have had the perfect excuse to fall behind their responsibilities as a NATO member while continuing to rely more and more on the US for what should be German defense responsibilities.  

For example, the Germans deliberately dragged their feet when supplying weapons to the Ukrainians and even going so far as sabatoging a MiG 29 deal the Ukranians were making with Poland using the excuse of "escalation" when the Ukranians are already drone striking Russian territory and being supplied more technologically advanced HIMARS and other US systems.
Population numbers talk, are they lies?
Just think about it, only the government have access to that data conveniently, I believe this one world government runs the stage using population number lies which is the key to everything. Let's take an example of elections, say an election is held and they choose who count the votes, they can say millions of voters gave them a mandate when those millions of voters don't exist. I think the people counting the votes are paid shills selected by the government. Population number lies would allow everything from polling to covid figures to be lied about. Just go on the btl of any major news site, people hate the Republicans and Tories on right wing papers, people hate the Democrats and Labour on left wing papers, people clearly don't want the parasites but those people don't realise they don't elect but are enslaved by this one world government fabricating elections. The polling doesn't match people's opinion on these paper's btls, I'll give you an example with Boris Johnson, he is clearly unpopular with The Telegraph btl but they seem to be deciding he is coming back any way against the will of the readers who clearly despise him. Leadership elections would be even easier to fabricate. Major news companies are in on it and are using holograms on their channels, fake outdoor scenery and pre planned narratives. It's obvious Trump will be brought back whether we like it or not. I think everything from viewing figures, to membership and follower figures are fabricated and many accounts are bots and fake, why do you think they are trying to destroy the high street with this orchestrated war, Zelensky and Putin are in this same club together like Hitler and Churchill were. Many accounts online are bots there to scam ordinary folk, all the major sites are allowing scammer bots to stay up with an agenda to lose ordinary folk as much money as possible and make huge wealth inequality. The biggest one is lies about historic army sizes and casualty figures, with some wars and battles plucked out of thin air. The population number lies are the key to how everything is run as a stage by this one world government that enslave us and choose who runs what country themselves, their empire is called earth and they give designated parts named "countries" to their own. How precious that we thought these billionaires would allow us to vote them in and out, they are busy putting working people's money from taxes in savings for as little service provided as possible, making profits from us while charging us for energy that we could get for free. These artificial looking phonys have enough money combined to end world poverty for good. The fabric of everything is trust and it is such an easy thing to be exploited and they know that full well and use it against us. That's why I think they lie about population numbers, I'd be willing to bet people are in their thousands in countries not millions, what do you think?
The "illuminati" insignia or the eye on top of the pyramid is actually a symbol that represents the philosophers stone from the ancient art of alchemy
The philosophers stone is a conceptual tool in the form of a symbol that the elite and many rich and powerful people used to their benefit throughout history.

[https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SMO5pHygB3o/VbXrRpHSoOI/AAAAAAAAE4k/Wf33eqDgXXs/s1600/Philosopher%2527sStone.jpg](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SMO5pHygB3o/VbXrRpHSoOI/AAAAAAAAE4k/Wf33eqDgXXs/s1600/Philosopher%2527sStone.jpg)

It is a symbol that represents the process of transformation, it does this by combining three esoteric symbols (the circle, the triangle and the square) into a single symbol that represents the natural process of transformation. It can demonstrate how the human eye transforms light into thought or data (the reason the elites use eye symbolism or one of the reasons), it can represent how a wankel rotary engine transforms fuel into energy, how a seed transforms into a plant, how the human body transforms from child to adult etc.

Freemasons and other secret societies still practice alchemy and the hermetic teachings associated with it. For example the free masons logo of the square and compass with the eye or G inside of it is a metaphor for the inner symbol of the philosophers stone symbol which is called the "squared circle". They simply hide all of these alchemy and hermetic teachings behind thick symbolism. Freemasons specifically use the philosophers stone for what they call "inner alchemy" which is a sort of self help process of bettering yourself or become a "superior person".

This article fully explains the symbol, how its used, who uses it and has used it and the overall understanding of it.

[https://medium.com/@bvkvfym413/thinkers-rock-629992ddac0f](https://medium.com/@bvkvfym413/thinkers-rock-629992ddac0f)

It was a bit of a read but the logic is solid and everything makes sense as far as the symbol and its meaning lining up to all of the examples I listed earlier. As somebody who has been investigating into weird conspiracy stuff like this and the "illuminati" for well over a decade I highly, highly recommend you read it. This is the one of the first things I have ever read about these topics that has ever truly made sense.

Good luck out there.
Conspiracy theory: I feel like tool brands are becoming slightly more aware about the homeownership crisis in America, that's why a lot of tool brands have stepped away from just doing power tools and started getting more into household appliances like vacuums, coffee makers, water coolers, fans,etc


There is a general trend I noticed a lot with  tool brands ane how they're starting to drift away from just marketing themselves solely as tool brands and starting to expand more into the household appliance and electronics sectors


I think tool brands are starting to notice the homeownership crisis in America more and more, so they're upping their advertising by getting into other types of appliances like light-duty household vacuums, coffee makers, extractors, water coolers, personal-sized fans and cleaning scrubbers that way they can still make money off of their DIY costumers. Some tenants still buy power tools though, they're just not as crazy about buying power tools as much as homeowners. Most apartment dwellers and house renters take the advantage of the landlord-provided services already as it is, that being said I am sure they are still ways DIY culture can creep into rental spaces such as working on your car, doing your fair share of woodworking, gardening, electronic tinkering or metalworking to name a few niches.

Dr. Tom Dark here, I'm new to this group and just want to introduce myself.  I've always been intrigued by conspiracy theories of all types and enjoy reading others' thoughts on the topic.  

Mods, please remove this if it's not allowed (I didn't see anything against it in the rules for this group, but understand if it's not)...I host a podcast called Welcome to Strangeland, which is a conspiracy theory based show where I also touch on paranormal things, usually which tie in to theories of some sort.  Feel free to check it out and I would love some feedback/engagement.

Thanks in advance and if allowed, I will not use this group solely to promote this...I just wanted to get it out here for any who may be interested.

Justice Department charges two people with conspiracy to destroy energy facilities

Financial Computer Attack
Anyone see klaus Schwab from the world economic forum say there‚Äôs going to be a computer glitch/ hack that is going destroy the economy? Anyone think this is already planned to usher in Agenda 2030?
My own personal takes
1. The Ukrainian Missile incident showed how divided NATO actually is.

The "Ukrainian Missile" that landed in Poland was actually Russian. There was just a coverup because NATO would be too divided on what to do unless Poland was ought right invaded by the Russians. Some members are straight up pro-Russian like Hungary. Turkey is sitting on the fence over whether to be Pro-Russian or Pro Western. Some are more pacifistic and were too scared of getting their natural gas shut off like Germany.  Also, it's possible German officials could have been paid off by the Russians to deliberately slow the process of supplying German weapons to Ukraine on top of Germany's already slow bureaucratic process. Boris Johnson even suggested that the Germans wanted Ukraine to fold during the beginning of the Russian invasion to "end the war quickly".



2) Germany would pull out of the 5 Eyes Plus Intelligence Agreement if China invaded Taiwan.

China is Germany's largest trading partner and has considerable influence over the German Government. Also, Scholtz's administration is pretty close with Xi's government as well. If the Chinese told them to, the Germans would probably leave the agreement.



3) The Obama Administration wouldn't have sent US troops against the Chinese if the PLA invaded Taiwan, and would have used an invasion as an excuse to eventually abandon Taiwan and make other pro-Chinese concessions.

For it's first term, the Administration deliberately put off deliveries of F-16s to the Taiwanese until Congress directly intervened.  For it's Return to Asia initiative, the Administration appointed pro-Chinese advisors. Administration officials deliberately ignored China's growing potential as a military threat with some like Secretary Clinton going so far to suggest that they aren't even adversaries.

Unlike Trump, Biden, Bush Jr, or Bill Clinton's, The Obama Administration never showed in any way that they were willing to use military force apart from the obligatory arms sales under the Taiwan Relations Act. Even Bush Jr said his administration would be willing to do "whatever it took" even if it involved using US troops.

In December 2016, the Obama Administration blocked a final 1 billion dollar arms sale to Taiwan. Between 2010 and 2012, 30 CIA agents were compromised while operating in China with the Obama Administration making no attempt at obtaining their release. Instead, they were executed after their capture.

Turkey cloud and earthquake
I find it suspicious that there was a portal cloud in Turkey late January and now seismic earthquakes. Could it be CERN?
Turkey Earthquakes
I find it odd that 4 out of the top 5 countries for u.s. defense spending were in the news this week with some kind if crisis. I hear one happened in Iran last week and commonly happen in turkey. Maybe this is being publicized heavily as a cover to send more money in the form of "relief" when it's really to aid to our strength on their border against russia?
My "Chinese Weather Balloon" Theory.
[SOURCES TO INFO INCLUDED] I believe that this instant is staged by the United States government as a way to start conflict with China for some reason unknown to me. This just sounds too similar to Operation Northwoods in the 60s when the US Government was planning on carrying out domestic terrorist attacks on Guantanamo Bay and around that area disguised as Cubans attacking as a reason to cause conflict with Cuba.
 For anyone about to tell me the Chinese have claimed the balloon I'm aware, but we all know the government can manipulate the media that is provided in our country and there is proof of it.

 (Check comments for links showing proof of both of these claims.)
spy balloon
my theory is. the chinese spy balloon floating over our society could very well be filled with bio chemicals to start another outbreak of some type of virus why would they send some weather balloon to come and spy on us they have military grade machinery and when the balloon popped there was a lot of white dust floating out of it just my theory maybe stupid idk
Alternative forms of life exist right here on Earth, undetected, because we don't recognize them.
What if there are other forms of life, unnoticed but existing with us simultaneously?? 

We are sharing our planet with other unrecognized creatures that do not fit our narrow-minded definition of carbon based life.  Perhaps, *as is likely,* silicon based life? Life that uses different biochemical and molecular processes from what is currently recognized by traditional definitions of 'life'.

There is a "Shadow Biosphere" hypothesis and it could explain many mysteries.

EDIT: *This is interesting:*

I feel like no one gets "probed" by aliens anymore...
In the 80's and earlier, it seemed like far more people were abducted so aliens could shove things up their ass. That seems to have fallen off dramatically. What do you think happened?
Chinese Weather Balloon
I truly believe the Chinese weather balloon is fake. I don‚Äôt think if China wanted to steal valuable U.S information they would be sending a weather balloon. China is smarter that and would not risk being caught by what would be such an obvious threat. I think that the government is using this as a distraction while they do some shady shit in the background. Every single news source is covering this story and would be a great way to distract U.S citizens. 
Very curious what everyone thinks.
Looking at the actual gun control data really puts it into perspective.

The word, "Lord", is translation from the word Baal. The God of Child Sacrifice, so why does the Bible call God, "The Lord"?
https://www.britannica.com/topic/Baal-ancient-deity

Given that information, then essentially, all Christians are praying to a false God if they just pray to "The Lord" without clarifying as Jesus Christ or just God.
I mean, this is unbelievable to me because now, thinking about it, their are scriptures that say God asked for sacrifices from Abraham of Isaac.. his son.
Not to mention other scriptures that he asked for sacrifices of humans, so my quarrel is factthat an All Loving God who is the Creator of the universe, should be able to snap his fingers or wave his hands and fix everything that was wrong, correct?

Yet, most people would argue that freewill is the reason why he can't, and so basically you are trying to tell me is that an apple, forbidden fruit, causes God to be rendered powerless and not being able to intervene or inhibit freewill?
Or is that what the Governmental Official Division (G.O.D.) wants us to believe to try and control the masses?

Do you guys think the chinese spy balloon might be a false flag operation?
As we all know, China is developing very quickly. That could disadvantage the US, which is why they could potentially want to do something against them. Besides, how could that balloon have gone through the pacific ocean?
Turkey earthquake conspiracy theory.
Turkey is preventing Finland and Sweden from entering NATO so the US exploded a nuke deep underground in Turkey. This will give a reason for Finland and Sweden to offer critical assistance to Turkey which will be returned in a form of admission into the alliance for both countries.
Can anyone explain the logic being the 'chemtrails' conspiracy?
Im from South Europe and whenever there are 'chemtrails' usually two to three days afterwards there's a massive weather change (strong rain/wind/snow/hail etc) so if i tend to believe in that id rather believe in some sorth of HAARP for a weather change then being sprayed chemicals consequences as us.. unless they are dumb as a rock which i doubt it

Im from South Europe and whenever there are 'chemtrails' usually two to three days afterwards theres a massive weather change (strong rain/wind/snow/hail etc) so if i tend to believe in that i'd rather believe in some sorth of HAARP for a weather change then being sprayed chemicals from personal experience

Theres enough bad shit in the food already poisoning us, i dont think the are doing that extra step to to spary toxic chemicals from the sky all around the world

Im no chemist not biologics but basic knowledge would indicated that if chemicals especially heavy metals being sprayed would mean most of the greenery and plants around would suffer often some period of time since heavy metals are not dissolved by water and they just sit in the soil for long periods of time

Armament of Taliban via CIA
I dont know if this is really a conspiracy or not, and alot of this is past information but I was watching a recent video about some brits who vacationed in Kabul as meme/content and they drove around and showed the black market with American arms, socialized with surprisingly very friendly Taliban militants and commanders, and I just thought that it was just wild seeing all the Humvees and assets being used in the video, at check points and what not.  

My hypothesis, so prior to the abrupt withdraw from the middle east the US CIA director met with the Taliban, I don't believe that information was meant to be exposed, by shortly after or in a similar time US forces withdraw and while there are accounts of mass destruction of resources there was vast amounts left for what I could only assume as purposeful armament of Taliban forces. 

While I think a lot of people can agree that the middle east up to maybe 10 years ago began to become a farce, unwonted and and large expenditure of global lives and resource, I think I seriously believe now that maybe as we have done in the past, we put in favor with an enemy, armed a specific sect and gave them the ability to hopefully peacefully control there space, and to do it internally without too much outside intervention, we can see the Taliban becoming maybe uncomfortably progressive in at least there public appearances, I mean hell they have a twitter with memes and there leaders and public relations make it seem like they want to stick around, either they have learned that being inhumane and barbaric leads to acid rain or they are under a directive that if they stay within some vague humane means of control that they may maintain that without US intervention.  women's rights and progressive ideas are talked about with news and locals as new ideas and while they may not be doing anything that they are saying on public platforms it is just very odd that they even care, maybe whomever is controlling them understands the basics of running a country. 

Strongly believe that having a stable dictatorship is a lot better then an total destabilization of that region, having a closed bubble that cannot make it to headlines here in the US could have been the goal, 

I am making alot of leaps of course, there is the understanding that weight of assets to move from there back to friendly soil would have costed more then the assets themselves and the time to destroy them all would be significant I just think the speed at wich we did all of this was very convenient for the tali and that the CIA was involved gives me big doubts spanding back to Mujahedeen, Sadam, Osama ect

Dark side of the Moon
There are humans from earth who have military bases on the dark side of the moon and have been up there since the early 80s. They have made initial contact with intelligent outwardly life form beings and have been relaying message back to an underground facility in Denver Colorado. 

I like to picture the aliens like from the Simpsons. With the small civilization living like in Total Recall. 

There is also a Black Knight Satellite that helped create the internet which beams back everyone‚Äôs search history to a much more advanced civilizations that study the psychology of the human behaviour.
Disneys Mickey Mouse redesign is a trap
So I thought of this one myself, and I don't exactly know if this is far-fetched or self evident, but I wanted to share this idea nonetheless.

So as you may know, Disney has somewhat recently put out a redesign of their biggest icon Mickey Mouse. It's obvious that this iteration is very similar to the way Mickey looked in the old Steamboat Willie Cartoon. While this may just look like a retro callback, I think there might be more to it than that.

One year from now, the copyright protection for the short film Steamboat Willie will expire and Mickey Mouse will finally enter the Public Domain after a century. Disney has historically taken various measures to defend against this, mostly by lobbying to extend the copyright duration. They've made it very clear that they want to keep their Mouse by all means possible. But this time it is very unlikely that they will get another extension, so it looks like Mickey Mouse will be able to be used by anyone in derivative works starting 2024.

But that doesn't mean you just get to use Mickey Mouse as we know it. You can only work with the version of Mickey Mouse exactly as it looked in that old film, without gloves, dots for eyes etc. The modern Mouse was invented later and as such will remain under copyright protection for a while longer.

So this is where the redesign comes in. It is my thought that they are introducing their redesign now to prepare so when the date comes and people start making derivative works using the Steamboat Willie Mouse, Disney can hit those artists with Copyright Lawsuits claiming that they are actually stealing Mickey Mouses current protected redesign as they look very similar.

Of course, this probably wouldn't be very likely to get them a win in court, but it doesn't have to. It just has to look legitimate enough to get the Lawsuit approved and started, not to actually win. Just the threat of having to deal with a lengthy and financially draining lawsuit against a megacorporation, legitimate or not, will likely dissuade many artists of even trying their luck with the old mouse, and those that are hit will likely be offered deals where they don't have to pay if they agree to never use any iteration of Mickey Mouse again.

For a conspiracy theory, I find my idea somewhat plausible. SLAPPing people with lawsuits as a war of attrition is a standard scare tactic for companies and has historically been used to dissuade piracy in a similar way. With how protective Disney has been of their creative property, this really seems like a logical step for them to take when extending the copyright is no longer an option.

Are there any theories out there? 

How do we know that the balloons originated in China? The Pentagon tested the same balloons in 2019 for narcotics tracking (so I've read). How do we know for sure that it's not from Russia or North Korea? Japan also used similar balloons for WWII.

Why the Earth spins.
The reason the Earth spins is because of all the cars driving and pushing the earth. With enough cars force the Earth will turn. If we stop using cars then the Earth will stop spinning and we will all die. It spins at such a high rate of speed because it is is space causing no friction making the momentum build up.
Low flying planes in London
I‚Äôm not sure if this belongs here but I‚Äôll post it anyway 

I‚Äôm in London and we have 6 airports; City Airport in the Docklands area east of the city is the smallest and the one nearest to the centre, Gatwick is far south in Sussex,
Luton is north in Bedford, Stanstead is North East in Essex and Southend, also in Essex, is in the east,

Heathrow lies in the west and is the only other airport aside from City to be within the London area though it‚Äôs far west and borders on to Berkshire.

I live and work in South East London, so we‚Äôre nowhere near an airport, and City Airports planes are too far east for us to be under their fligh path.

The planes over the last few years since 2020 have been weirdly low, too low for where we are, we can practically see the logo of the airline.

For anyone else in London that lives in a non flight path area has anyone else noticed this?
Funding Policing over Education
Why fund police tactical units when the people you are policing can't read well or produce STEM related jobs. Most Black American shy away from Math and Science and if they do go to college they major in fields that do not pay well. A white high school drop out with a skill makes more money than some college graduates that are black. No Child Left Behind was a joke.  The thought that Black people  just commit crimes has to do with their lack of business ownership and America poor education for inner city children. Why not just fund education over policing?
what do you predict the next 20 years to be like?
With the evolution of AI, subsequent layoffs, inflation, growing resentment towards the rich, and political instability, it seems we're at the natural end of a system's lifetime. Either slowly approaching it, or very close. What system takes its place largerly depends on how things play out. 

I do feel like billionaires and the general "elite" are either preparing for something we don't know about. Or sense something and are hoarding their wealth. 

This could be some crazy advancement in technology that might change how we view the world - like the metaverse and ability to live in a different reality. 

Imagine how depressed, overworked, and unhealthy we'll be in a couple years if things keep going like this. Privatization, corporations taking over, mental health decline, mass shootings, poverty, etc. 

At that point, everyone will be on meds withering away and deciding its best to plug into a metaverse. 

Or it could be climate change and how the system is collapsing. More food and medicine shortages. So the rich keep hoarding. They're wealthy enough to keep their own farms, have land to grow food, and property to keep them away from poorer people. 

But then I think of the past and wonder if it feels this bad because we have all the information at our fingertips. And people to share it with. 

What do you guys think the future has in store for us? Give me your best predictions, however specific or general.
Velma is bad on purpose.
HBO Max made Velma bad on purpose. They picked to spinoff a scooby doo show instead of making a new one because they knew more eyes would go to a new Scooby doo show instead of another new bad show. More people watching awful show = people talking about bad show which means more people buying HBO Max to see how bad the show truly is. They handed the reins to a famous Indian person because they knew Indians are very much underrepresented on TV so the chance to put a Indian Velma as the main character would be too tantalizing for Mindy to say no. Velma is a 4D chess move to get everybody to buy HBO Max and maybe stay around to watch some other shows. Also HBOM eliminated scooby because they knew people would get mad at the original shows namesake not being there.

Or maybe the writers are just tremendously incompetent and HBO Max is shitting their pants right now.

The Eye of Providence
What if I told you there was a hole in the world? A hole into which all the potential and wealth of the world was disappearing, leaving behind only an undifferentiated, lifeless husk?

That hole is the actual eye of providence, a void of information, the result of the world possessing the dual nature of openness and closedness. It is responsible for turning things into their opposites, so turning everything authentic artificial and warping the real into illusion. It is the antagonist of the free world as it strives towards information totality and seeks to dominate all life. The end result is a virtual world where you can trust nothing.

As our wealth disappears, it goes into this void, which in practical terms means into the hands of a decreasing minority relying on an ever increasing majority to animate their detached, morbid interests. People are merely cattle under this paradigm, and if you act out of line you will be targeted with repercussions or ultimately sacrificed.

However, there is a solution. It is the responsibility of all people to become aware and to turn our weaknesses into strengths, coming together and going after the eye in concept and its manifestation on earth. The system can only self-correct if people are willing to sacrifice their own comfort and potentially safety for the greater good. To live under the system the price is your integrity and soul.

My conspiracy theory on humanity and its past
There are many monuments that we have found that are absolutely bizarre. The most famous examples being the Great Pyramids of Giza, The Great Sphinx, Globeki Tepi (probably spelled that wrong my b) the Easter heads, and countless others, including some popular myths that, in fact, could hold an inkling of truth. Now, what do *all* of these monuments, structures, and long forgotten cities have in common? 

We haven't the slightest clue who built them, struggle with understanding how they were made, and most importantly, *for what purpose?*

Now, there are many theories, some say the Pyramids were giant energy sources, some say extraterrestrial beings had a hand in human life, and some believe that the famous yet somehow nonexistent city of Atlantis was a hub of technology, similar too or more advance than today.

I'm here to fit all these things together, and both greatly praise and lift the human past higher up, without involving magical miracles that we, as modern day humans, somehow had overlooked. (Of course capitalism could also be preventing us from actually achieving this knowledge as well, but I digress) 

First, lets talk about the *construction* of such monuments. Not why, but how. The Pyramids, Sphinx, Wall of China, Easter Statues (yes, statues, not heads) Stonehenge, and Globeki Tepi all have one major thing in common. They are upright structures either set up or carved out of the Earth, with multiple examples of complex carving present.

 Some people claim that simple humans couldn't have done such a thing, but I raise a question to these same people: If you met a challenge that, according to others, should've been impossible, do you give up? Or do you find alternative means to the same end? 

A good example of this is how my father had the cookies on the fridge, and my 4 year old butt still, without fail, find a way to get to them. To combat this, he hid the cookies in a little nook above the stairs, at least 6 feet away from any leverage, platform, any kind of foot handle possible, and the stairs were too narrow to set something up. I unfortunately have no memory of what I did, but according to my parents, I had somehow used a mattress to climb up into the nook and was sitting on the ledge eating cookies. Eventually the mattress fell and slid down the stairs, and my father, thinking I just threw the mattress down the stairs, went up just to notice my feet dangling from his position. Remember, a regular twin sized mattress is *big* for a 4 year old to manipulate quietly and rather too flexible for even a four year old to use as a ladder. I will admit I have this reoccurring nightmare of standing on a block and the block moving forward, and me missing the point to grab a ledge, but I'm not sure if that's related. 

Point is, I managed to figure out a way to manipulate the oddest materials in the most unlikely surroundings to achieve some kind of goal, no matter what. And I was 4. If a 4 year old, especially one that didn't speak or play much, was capable of *that?* Then we really are underestimating human ingenuity of our ancestors (which, if you pay attention, the idea of our ancestors being primitive and unable to manipulate the world around them stems from racism, an unfortunate sidetrack of the scientific community of the past)

Now, lets rewind the clock to 12000 years ago, where the Earth was much cooler, the temperate zone was far closer to the equator, and most of this zone was steppe rather than desert, jungle, and swamp. This would make various structures, especially towards the "center" of the Earth, in prime locations of agriculture, work, and even the first ideas of civilization. Now, why is this important? Because the Earth was much cooler, more could be done with less exhaustion, and the climate was steady. Because most of this land was steppe, it meant it was fairly flat, with low shrubs and scarce trees, which meant that wood was not as common, and it would have been easy to cause major deforestation, and humans being humans, *knew this*. So in order to build, especially fortifications, housing, temples, and feats of ingenuity, they had to use another, very abundant material: stone. 

Because humans were masters at finding a way, they would have found that way. No aliens, no angels, humans themselves, and saying they couldn't otherwise is honestly, really underselling the human mind and the human will. As they say, "If there's a will, there's a way." 

So, how did they do this? Simple: They used the world around them, and found a way. First, is cutting the stone. While we have yet to find how they were so *precise*, we do know how to split stone by hand. Take a spike (they likely used a spike made of the same material the stone was made of) and then pound that spike down with some kind of weight, like a hammer or heavy rock. Do this multiple times until spike is all the way in, then get another spike and continue, until you have multiple spikes in the large stone in a line, at which point, just physics and gravity by themselves will spilt the rock like butter. There are quarries in many parts of the third world that do this instead of diamond cutting tools, they just use metal spikes instead of stone, but the idea is still the same. 

There is even an ongoing project right now of a bunch of people trying to rebuild a medieval castle using medieval tools, and they needed a way to lift large stones up onto the higher platforms to create, uh those blocks that archers hide behind when shooting down at enemies. I forgot what they were called. To accomplish lifting the stones, they had to do extensive research into medieval castle buildings, and found that they used, get this, a crane attached to a human sized hamster wheel. And it works wonders. What. 

Moving the rocks seemed too difficult too, but that showed to be a false idea when a guy from *Michigan* managed to start building his own Stonehenge. By using counters, seesaw stacking, and small pebbles in specific locations, he could move over 1 ton blocks of stone *by himself* over 30 feet a day, and even did this to move a pole barn. He also was able to stand a rock up by lifting it in a unique way, by using the empty space created from seesawing a rock to place some wood, then sending the rock the other way, and repeating the process until 3 feet high before dropping the end of the rock into a shallow hole, effectively standing up a rock, *by himself*. Dude has grandkids, and he did this. 

This shows that if one old man can move stones, a group of college kids can build a castle, and some poor bastard in a third world country can split entire boulders in half, then a community of individuals who had generational skills in masonry would've seen a project like Stonehenge, the Easter Statues, and even Globeki Tepi as a cakewalk. But what about the Pyramids? Well, we don't really know: yet. 

The pyramids and even the Sphinx are a bit of a mystery, due to factthat many of the large stones were lifted so high and the stones themselves were so heavy, and the Sphinx itself was carved, literally, out of the ground. It wasn't built there, the rock that the sphinx is made of was already there *in the first place*.

But why can't we do this stuff now? Simple, really. 

We simply lost that knowledge to the past. When it came to knowledge, especially knowledge of construction, it always seems, without fail, that we keep losing the blueprints, assuming we would never forget. 

Well, we forgot. 

Wars, conquest, treasure, food, extreme cold, and many generations of not *having* to build such structures? Of COURSE we would eventually lose this knowledge, and trying to pursue that knowledge again, we ended up using our *modern understanding* of how to do such things, then end up baffled when a bunch of supposed "slaves" or "primitive humans" (I personally want to punch whomever came up with such a stupid and disrespectful word choice against our ancestors) were capable of constructing things far more impressive than even our modern technology can't easily compete with. It's simple: 

We forgot and came up with a new idea on how to do something. Notably, masonry. 

But now we know who and how, but what about the big one: 

#*WHY!?*

For some, I have great ideas, others, I'm not 100% sure, and needs further actual study, as well as a release of the private knowledge to the public. (LOOKING AT YOU, ZAHI) 

For Globeki Tepi, it's, without a doubt in my mind, an observatory. I believe this because, think about it. Humans didn't neccessarily have artificial light other than fire, and they didn't sleep as often at night because of the off chance of raiders and predators. So what did they do on their nighttime breaks?

They looked up. 

And if you've been anywhere, where there is a little light pollution as possible, and you looked up, would would see *essentially* the same thing our ancestors saw.

And endless sky of immeasurable beauty. 

I would build an observatory by myself made of stone if I got to see such beauty every night, but that's just me. 

What about Easter Island? Simple: Ain't the slightest clue. Literally random statues that are buried up to their necks on a few scattered random island in the South Pacific Ocean. Like *what?* Its easy to figure out how they were built (I think they were carved while lying flat, then lifted up using the seesaw trick) but like why? Best I can come up with is some kind of guard to the Pacific Ring of Fire, assuming Polynesians were that were more than highly skilled at sailing and navigation (They probably were, considering master masons obviously existed then as well)

Stonehenge? Probably a solid temple/community center. Realistic answer to me, at least. This was also built a mere 6000 years ago compared to the others, in what was essentially wetlands at the time. 

But what about the Pyramids and Sphinx? 

Remember that shout at some guy called Zahi? Well he's a lead archeologist in Egypt, who had went into the Sphinx, and then proceeded to claim there is nothing of any value whatsoever, and even denying common knowledge like the various holes and passages that lead *into* the Sphinx. 

I personally believe, mostly based off some guys ramblings from the 90s, that the Sphinx is an ancient library, which may hold the knowledge of construction, sailing, the stars, and various lost cities throughout Africa. One of which is possibly the famous mythical place, Atlantis. 

The Pyramids have a whole host of different ideas, from tombs to some kind of energy source. Keep in mind, while humans have always had certain needs or wants, the pursuit of energy is a *newer* concept, that only really came around due to industrialization. Before that, people needed things like heat and light, and that's about it, and it was mostly obtained through the fireplace within a home or community. We hadn't reached the point of "automation" again yet. 

So what were the Pyramids for? Honestly, nothing and everything as of right now. We probably *could* know if we knew what was inside the Sphinx, but chances are that won't happen anytime soon. I personally like the idea of Ancient Egyptians wanting to be able to slide down the sides of them like a giant snow hill, and the wooden platforms that went up to the top are now gone and the Pyramids are no longer smooth, which means no more sledding :(

And what about *ATLANTIS?* Probably just a major trade hub that got washed away from a major glacial calving event that spilled into the Black Sea, then the Mediterranean, then swept across Africa before wiping out Atlantis. Where is Atlantis? I personally think its the Richat Structure, or the more commonly known as the "Eye of the Sahara". I inquire any curious people that read this far down to look into it for further detail. 

TL;DR: Humans are smart bois, They used smart ways to build that we forgot about, and all of the cool old stuff had a variety of known and unknown reasons for being built, from observatories, to libraries, to cities, and even a giant sledding hill. Also humans are cool and have always been cool, despite our flaws here and there.

Crypto will crash to the point of no return.
All crypto (bitcoin,  Ethereum,  Tether, etc..) will be a complete fail. I refuse to invest into cryptocurrency especially with political tension in every direction. The us is on the edge of recession and all it will take is a hacker or some EMP device to practically tank the value of crypto. All the talk of the grid being under attack, tensions rising between the USA and Russia, and the evolution of technologies, there isn't any doubt in my mind that the only 'safe' form of currency is precious metals, and physical assists.

The government is intentionally trying to suppress public knowledge of parapsychology (original)
Here are the major points that suggest that this is true.

1. Parapsychology is one of the most controversial subjects in postgraduate research despite irrefutable evidence and compelling work.
2. Warnings are spread online to not do telekinesis (or other psi phenomena) in public.
3. The few people that can exhibit psi remains highly secretive about it.
4. Conspiracy surrounds prize rewards given to anyone who can demonstrate paranormal phenomena, namely James Randi of course. 

I first got notice of this conspiracy on TikTok, where telekinesis TikTok users share the warning of "don't exhibit psi in public, or you will be taken by the government". ,  
Here are just a few of the comments or video texts I gathered from TikTok alone

>"don't do it in public :warning:"  
"don't do in public"  
"Be careful that can be dangerous in public Berrry!"  
"next time don't do it in public."  
"in public :shock:, ur not.. afraid?"  
"U can get taken by them"  
"me: doing telekinesis in public  
: is she doing telekinesis??  
I'm screwed"  
" don't spread around that you have telekinesis and don't do your telekinesis in public  
They are watching  
STAY SAFE"  
"Don't do telekenesis in public  
you could get taken  
or do  
they might not even be real"  
"There are vans going around taking kids and people who have it  
The government also been deleting telekinesis Tiktok's??!!"

Interestingly, the accounts that comment this likely also have telekinesis content of their own

Facebook secretly drained users‚Äô phone batteries, ex-worker alleges

THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE...
These are long days and torturous nights for Paul Gosar and Kelli Ward, both of whom have shown support for the insurrectionists at the United States Capitol.¬† 

The Justice Department is deep into multiple investigations, investigations bolstered by evidence provided by the Jan. 6th Committee of the failed coup attempt, and they now possess a ‚Äòlandslide of evidence 'most of which comes from cell phones seized by the FBI.¬† 

They have recovered a treasure-trove of information from the phones of Giuliani, Eastman, Scott Perry, Mike Lindell, Boris Eashteyn, Victoria Toensing, (both Giuliani advisors) Michael McDonald, and Jeffrey Clarke, just to name a few. 

For a few brief moments this week, the sugar plums of sedition again danced in congressional heads when the courts issued a hold on Scott Perry‚Äôs phone. Ah, but the funny thing about telephones is they are two-way devices. 

In the heat of the insurrection phone calls, text messages, and emails flew about the government like newspapers on a New York City Street in a windstorm, but unlike the newspapers, these have been collected, collated. and compiled into binders related to specific schemes and to specific personages, to overthrow our democracy. 

Schemes like mounting a concerted effort to invalidate a legitimate vote, schemes like falsifying a slate of phony electors to change the vote, and most insidious of all, a scheme to replace a recalcitrant Attorney General with a stooge who would claim he sees irregularities in the election and will have the military seize the voting machines where, God knows, what would be done to them. 

Yes, there are heavy heads on pillows as the Justice Department completes its mission. Gosar and Ward aren‚Äôt the only ones sleeping a fitful sleep, they are joined by Mo Brooks, Louie Gohmert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, Josh Hawley, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Tom Cotton, Mike Lee, Lauren Boebert, Jim Banks, and others in their sweat-soaked tossing and turning. 

It‚Äôs taking some time, but you know what they say about the wheels of Justice.

I see WAY too many SW trucks on the road when I'm traveling. Like, a ridiculous amount. How much paint are they really moving? A semi trailer can hold about 28,000 1 gallon pails of paint. If I am driving to the next city and I see 6 SW trucks headed that way, are you telling me they are moving 168,000 gallons of paint? Its not like I live in a well populated area, or near a SW distribution center, or even on a major trucking corridor, I just see a ton of these trucks and I am convinced they're hauling more than just paint. 


To add to that last part, I looked on their job postings and I can't find anywhere that it says they haul anything other than their own products.

Instagram has the voices base so it could recommend you people you've met
maybe I'm schizophrenic as hell but since the time I found out that Zuckerberg listens to what I say to make facebook and Instagram ads more accurate I've been really suspicious of those apps. So today I opened it and there is a list of people I might know, which I usually check because there is really some people who I know (some are those who are followed by those who I follow, some are simply from my phone numbers). so I open Instagram almost everyday, see this list almost everyday, and today there is a new user (by surprise it was the person with whom I spoke just today)..

quite possible this is only because our phones were close but 1) it's way more boring theory     2)I don't think I've met this method of recommending people before
There's a reason for that.

JonBenet Ramsey is Katy Perry theory.
About 7 years ago, I came across a YouTube video of this guy explaining that JonBenet is Katy Perry. There‚Äôs tons of videos on it now due to the popularity of the topic, but this specific video was really creepy. It was a grown man trying to convince people what he believed, but with cut scenes of JonBenet‚Äôs face melding with Katy Perry‚Äôs. The background music was JonBenet singing in a pageant. Very low quality on everything. Sometimes, it would cut to silence and a picture of JonBenet, then it would go back to his ‚Äúproof‚Äù. I found the video again about 6 to 8ish months ago, but I can‚Äôt find it again to post it. 
Mind you, I was 17 when I found this video. I remember commenting how insane and insensitive he sounded and he basically freaked out on me. Saying how ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt there‚Äù and how ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see the truth‚Äù or some shit.
Anyway, has anyone else heard this theory or seen this specific video?

EDIT: I found out that the original creator is named Dave Johnson. The video was uploaded in 2014. I just can‚Äôt find the video itself.

Eggs are too expensive so chicken on birth control!?!
I was scanning the web and came across videos by backyard or homestead group concerning eggs. These people have made videos stating that their own private livestock had stop laying eggs. Many people are saying this was caused by taint chicken feed while others are saying that feed was replaced with birth control feed. Many of people who are raising their own livestock, do so because of food prices and food standards. What do y'all think?

I have a theory. So what if breathing air keeps us in this consciousness like it keep us in this world. Since we consume oxygen every second we get trapped here and that's why weed or any other stuff that makes you high are illegal cause they show you that the world we are in right now is fake. As after we die we stop consuming oxygen and as soon as we stop consuming air we wake up in our actual consciousness and do you know when people get high they go to a different realm and see figure out of this world what if they have drugged us with oxygen and some times when we come across hunted stuff or ghost you'll release that you are not breathing properly meaning not consuming oxygen - you see beings from different realms and since baby's and old age people don't have a strong breathing system they come across being's not from this world... inspired by "percy Jackson movie 1 Las Vegas  lotus hotel scene"
Just finished Ancient Apocalypse...
And I hated it. 

I find ancient buildings and monuments absolutely fascinating, as well as ancient myths and legends. 

But this guy, Graham Hancock, who has no education in archaeology or anthropology as far as I can tell, is going to these fascinating sites and then trying to construct some bizarre narrative akin to Ancient Aliens. 

There is so much we don't know about our ancient past, and it's genuinely a fascinating field of study. But "we don't know" is the only answer so many of the questions posed in the documentary. And the nonsense theories he's inventing just turn me cold, and he constantly denigrates actual archaeologists and anthropologists as incompetent, corrupt, or fearful. Like they are afraid of the truth, rather than dong their jobs in being skeptical and weighing the totality of the evidence. 

I'll believe there was some ancient technologically advanced society teaching hunter gathers how to stack rocks on top of eachother when Graham can show me a fossilised screwdriver.

A group of us experience poltergeist like phenomena by a wild mountain
(Headphones recommended for link) On January 21, 2023, I took a group out to one of my research areas:  a Yowie hunter (Australia Bigfoot) / paranormal investigator, two sound professionals and a hominid enthusiast. Here I have caught ufo‚Äôs on camera, recorded very strange voices-some call my name (some of them don‚Äôt sound human but are talking), had stones thrown at me, found wild structures, been approached by things I could not see but hear, heard stone click-clack sounds, heard what sounds like trees getting ripped down etc. 

I was interested as to what the beings would do when I took them. We perched up on the wild valley lookout with no public access or tracks. Dangerous to transverse. Here is where I had a wild pig freshly cut open left by my gift bag. In this area there Is no hunting allowed and the wildlife conservation authority is strict about destroying harmful predators. 

I recorded what sounds like a stone being thrown at us. Dis-embodied voices in a wild area with no artificial lighting sources. Stone clack sounds and some of voices call our names too. So this could fit into the paranormal activity realm but also Bigfoot associated phenomena along with another huge topic that of aliens and UFOs. I have hit the mother load in my research. I am glad others got to experience some of this, most of all recorded.

I suspect a part of my success is due to me conducting ITC electronic sessions as well. 

My work is troubling to non-believers. I even have an invite from one of the Bigfoot people that I received back in 2015 after returning for a long period in the USA (also after an encounter by Skinwalker Ranch in 2013). I am a very haunted man so-to-speak and you can even hear why.

Cocaine-Cola
In the beginning of coca cola, they used to use cocaine in the ingredients. They stopped and coca cola was just a regular un caffeinated drink. At some point they tried to make a caffeinated Java drink. I don't see that as much anymore but now coca colas new thing is "Original Taste". The original taste insinuates they went back to some old flavor but the biggest difference I see is that now all coca cola is caffeinated. Is it possible that their "Original Taste" refers to them putting cocaine *back* into the recipe because now they're all caffeinated unlike before the original taste label. Under ingredients for the box and can it only says "caffeine". At least with energy drinks, it'll say Guarana extract or taurine. They only say caffeine which is suspicious.
documents to download for reading while off the grid
Anybody have any suggestions for me to download. I will be traveling to an area with no cell service so I'm looking for some reading material for the next few days. I remember a document that was from an interview with an alien after the roswell crash. I would love to finish reading that one.
I figured out what UFOs are. Here's how I did it and what I know, please read:
	I conducted two different experiments, by myself, using myself as guinea pig. I did these over the course of many years. One of the experiments had to do with the statistical frequency, geographical spread, and nature of UFO sightings. My thinking went: UFO sightings happened anywhere, happened regularly, and happened bizarrely- some of the behavior being ‚Äúalien-like‚Äù, and some of the behavior being abstraction-like. UFOs were perhaps either aliens or perceptual error. If it was perceptual error, it belonged in the realm of psychology. Curious about what they were, and noting the frequency and spread of sightings, I wondered this: would anyone who determined themselves to go out UFO-watching, every single night, or even regularly, for years and years on end, be guaranteed eventually to see a UFO? Note that, in retrospect, this is similar to asking a question like: does going UFO-watching *cause* UFO-sightings? Try to hold that thought.

	My other experiment was at first unrelated, and was about a phenomenon that actually even less was known about: visual hallucination. Visual hallucination was so rare that it was essentially unstudied. I had some questions and wanted to be the first to break ground on the topic. I came up with an experiment that had two components to it: in part it would test whether visual hallucination could be induced in any person. In part it would test whether visual hallucination was actually a form of dreaming: a sort of accident where the brain starts dreaming somehow while the person is awake and has their eyes open. It was the only thing I could guess that visual hallucination was, since it didn‚Äôt make sense to me otherwise, mechanically. How could anyone see anything that wasn‚Äôt there, looking through transparent and unobstructed eyeballs just like everyone else has? This was primarily a sleep-deprivation experiment: I reasoned that perhaps with enough sleep-deprivation you could get your brain to start dreaming while you were awake.  

	First I want to tell you about the UFO experiment, which I had begun in the 2000‚Äôs, years earlier than the hallucination experiment, and which I had already had some successes with. My first major success happened after several years of consistent, regular trying. There had been minor successes that I considered indeterminate- maybe a small UFO briefly/far away. Then, in 2010, I had a major sighting, of lots of UFOs, over several nights, some that looked like spheres, some that looked like aerial craft of some sort, and some that looked like large abstractions, up in the woods. Friends with me at the time saw some of it, too. I captured a little of it on video. No question it was whatever ‚ÄúUFOs‚Äù are. Up close, it gave me the impression that it was some bizarre phenomenon, and not aliens, and not perceptual error. The forms seemed life-like, but too nonsensical to be likely life-forms. It seemed to be something even more bizarre. I didn‚Äôt know what to make of it or how to report it; I didn‚Äôt bother at the time. I just kept my notes and video (I had managed to capture a bright light appearing and disappearing in the air on the last night) and kept thinking about it. A friend on this trip who saw a glowing sphere with me, up close, about forty feet away from us and about ten feet off the ground, maybe ten inches wide, that suddenly appeared in mid-air, and then disappeared when we ran toward it, kept saying the same thing about it afterward, that they remembered it and couldn‚Äôt explain it. That footage I later lost but I held onto the notes I had made of everything I had seen.  

	Some years after this, in 2014, I started running my hallucination experiment. Sure enough, my bet was right on the money. As it turns out, if you stay awake long enough, you do force your brain to dream, ‚Äúwith your eyes open‚Äù, and this is visual hallucination; it places dream-images into your field of view, right alongside all the other things you‚Äôre seeing. Finally I had explained the mechanism. I was hoping to write a paper on this, for the field of psychology. I decided to first increase the experiment duration though, to try to get an even more dramatic result before I sat down to write. There would still be a question of whether-or-not this was what was going on in the brains of people who have visual hallucination but who are not sleep-deprived. My feeling was that this was going on anyway, but somehow was happening without sleep-deprivation in those people.  

	Here, though, as I tried to increase the sleep-deprivation amount, to deepen the hallucination quality and have a little more to write about in my description, I got instead a shocking result- let me explain what I had been seeing so far in my experiment: something like a color spot that would appear in my vision, that had a sort of flat, 2-d look to it, and that I could tell was ‚Äúin my eyes‚Äù or, mind, though it appeared superimposed in the environment, and that would sort of go in and out of looking image-like. What happened one night was that this same sort of color spot, with increased sleep deprivation, instead of expanding, lasting longer, or turning into a more specific form, turned 3-d looking, like it was actually there- not something in my eyes or mind but something in the room. I mean it went from looking like a hallucination, to looking like it was an actual, external, floating hologram, outside of myself, that I could pick up a camera and take a picture of. It was like a little semi-transparent floating orb. It lasted briefly like this and then it disappeared. Certain of my instincts, that I had seen what I thought I saw, I decided to continue this line of research as a project. I wanted to see whether I could make this effect happen again, and capture it on film this time. In the ensuing months and years, I developed a technique to increase the body‚Äôs chances of producing this effect, and, I found that I indeed was able to capture these effects, when they occurred, on film. You cannot capture a normal hallucination *on film*; if I was capturing these on film, they were externally visible. Soon I had gotten proof on video that these holograms were mind-produced, when in 2015 I was able to capture one that was of something that obviously was produced by my own subconscious: a representation of the backside of a car that I had been looking at earlier in the day (here is that footage: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTUG021NEhU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTUG021NEhU). Only the glowing tail-lights of the ‚Äúcar‚Äù are visible in the footage because it was taken in the dark and the cell-phone camera over-compensated for the brightness of certain parts of the hologram and dimmed itself automatically; in person, a complete outline of a car was dimly visible around the tail-lights. It was like a glowing, semi-transparent, holographic model of a car, floating in air, absolutely still but sort of shifting over a couple of minutes and then disappearing, located right where the top of a bush was, a few feet away from me, and sort of covering the top of the bush. This hologram lasted a couple minutes and then started to disperse; I caught the tail end of this happening on video. The ‚Äúcar‚Äù was about three feet wide, four feet long, and about three feet above the ground; here is a video taken of the exact same spot during the daytime, with a spin-around so you can see the area: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo4N\_TgX4M4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo4N_TgX4M4). You can see that this was on a small hill with a wall behind it; there‚Äôs nothing that could have been reflecting and there‚Äôs no way a real car could have been parked in that same spot. This footage is not very clear but I invite anyone to analyze it). It‚Äôs difficult to catch these on film because they happen at random times, all of a sudden, and don‚Äôt last long. After years of doing this, though, I had observed hundreds of different productions of this effect, many of which were extremely impressive. I compared these all to the entire history of UFO sightings: I found that the catalog of different examples I had made of this effect matched the UFO record, which seemed as well to be divisible into spheres, indistinct forms, and distinct forms, whose shapes and behaviors further matched mine. I found that the spheres were the easiest to do, indistinct forms were a little harder to do and were something of a progression beyond the sphere shape which apparently was the basic form of this, and that, at ‚Äúmax power‚Äù of the effect, and most rare and difficult to do, were full-forms, where it looked like a complete, real object, rather than just a sphere or some weird shape. I found that this matched the UFO canon exactly: the UFO record can be divided into incidences of mostly spheres, followed by incidences of ‚Äúweird shapes‚Äù, and most rarely, what are apparently fully-formed images. What I realized was that the technique that I had devised, wherein a person could increase their chances dramatically of producing one of these, was somehow happening anyway, rarely yet regularly, in the normal population. I worked to identify specifically which factors of momentary behavior can cause the ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù of these effects in a ‚Äúnormal-conditions‚Äù person, meaning a person who is not intentionally trying to do one of these, but who accidentally does one.  

	There are several factors I found that individually or together can increase the chances of someone doing one of these or that can cause one of these. In general I term this type of effect ‚Äú**external**‚Äù **hallucination** (as I later found, this is a class of effects, of different types, that I have further termed. The effect currently being discussed, which pertains to all ‚ÄúUFOs‚Äù, and some other things, I have termed specifically ‚Äú**external visual hallucination**‚Äù, as it is in effect, visual hallucination, *externally*). Here are the **factors** that pertain somewhat to all external hallucinations and specifically to external visual hallucination, and discussions of how they are found in the regular population:

	First of all, if the extremely rare effect of external hallucination occurs, it tends to happen **when** or after **a person** **mentally dissociates**, for a relatively long time, often **while** happening to have a **high heart rate and/or blood pressure**. There are mechanical reasons for this which I will discuss later on. ‚ÄúDissociate‚Äù is a term I have had to borrow and modify somewhat for my own purposes. I am using the word as follows: when someone‚Äôs thoughts absorb their own attention fully, such that, even though they have their eyes open and are even perhaps performing tasks, they actually have gone momentarily blind to their own sensories, such that, they aren‚Äôt really seeing what‚Äôs happening, they‚Äôre losing track of time, and when they ‚Äúreturn‚Äù from this state, they won‚Äôt have a memory of what they saw while they were thinking or of how long they were thinking for. This can happen quickly or this can go on for a long time. The truth is, everyone actually dissociates every time they think at all. It‚Äôs just that it usually happens for so short a time that it doesn‚Äôt interfere with anyone‚Äôs normal flow of tasks or cause accidents. Usually it‚Äôs happening for split seconds, or at most a few seconds. Now, while this is happening, the person also has to be having an unusually high heart rate and blood pressure. Basically when you combine high heart rate/blood pressure with mental dissociation, you are in a configuration for possibly launching an external hallucination, but not guaranteed to do so, it is still a rare chance. Further, there are similar trends that go with and increase the chances if combined, or that can sometimes stand alone to cause these:

**Sleep deprivation**\- sleep deprivation goes hand-in-hand with a technique that requires high heart rate and mental dissociation, because, sleep deprivation does both of these things to you- on one hand, sleep deprivation increases, not decreases, your heart rate / blood pressure, because, your body has to work harder to overcome the fatigue of muscles. If you‚Äôre sleep deprived, you will notice that your heart is pumping faster than usual, while you‚Äôre being active, as part of keeping you awake and moving. Second, sleep deprivation shortens, dramatically, your short-term memory, because basically your brain is tired. Shortening your short-term memory increases your tendency to dissociate, because you forget what‚Äôs going on faster and it increases your propensity to ‚Äútune out‚Äù and be lost in thought momentarily. Most people are vaguely familiar with ‚Äúdifficulty concentrating‚Äù while tired. Without intentionally trying to sleep-deprive oneself, many people regularly get sleep-deprived anyway for various reasons and still show up for work the next day anyway. Someone who‚Äôs just had a baby, for instance, is likely to be sleep-deprived for the first couple of years. Someone who is simply stressed, excited, depressed, thoughtful, uncomfortable, or bothered, like by loud noise outside, or like by bed bugs, during the night, can get sleep-deprived. Some people suffer from insomnia which they consider otherwise cause-less. Some people lose sleep from simply having too much work to do and doing it, staying up all night. Some people stay up all night partying, drinking, having sex, and then go in to work the next day without having actually slept. Any sleep-deprivation is one way I‚Äôve found of increasing the chances of accidentally externally hallucinating. The incidence of sleep-deprivation in the regular population is high enough, upon consideration, to be a factor.  

	The following **emotions** can be said to increase the chances of external hallucination, because, they do the same thing: **excitement, wonder, fear**. Each of these, or combinations, for any reason, will increase heart rate / blood pressure and will increase your dissociation tendency. These can happen to any person at any time, but, for some more often or with more guarantee than for others, for example, anyone undergoing military training exercises. This is one of the reasons why external hallucination incidents are found to happen more often on military bases / ranges than elsewhere; it‚Äôs actually because they‚Äôre doing exciting and death-defying things on a regular basis, and how those emotions play into the configuring of a person‚Äôs body to be in the external-hallucination mode. Also true in warzones.

	In general, **extreme physical activity**, exertion, exhaustion, and **variations of exhaustion** like dehydration, hunger/fasting, and muscle fatigue can increase the chance. Activity increases heart rate & blood pressure, exhaustion increases dissociation. When fighter pilots pull high G‚Äôs, their incidence is likely raised by blood-pressure spiking.

**Belief** can also be said to be a factor on its own as I‚Äôve found, meaning, if you are confident that you will see a **certain thing**, or very curious about seeing a certain thing, this actually helps do it, or can on its own in some cases be enough to do it, especially if many hours are spent trying. What you think you‚Äôll see, or wonder if you‚Äôll see, consciously affects what your subconscious will project.  

	Here is a discussion on the effects of **pharmaceuticals/drugs**, various, on external hallucination chances. Understand, there are two different hallucination effects: ‚Äúinternal‚Äù (regular type) and external, but only one hallucination ability; so, you cannot, at one time, do both at kinds at once, though you can rapidly go from doing one kind to doing the other. The two effects work a little differently and have different causes. So, in general, things that increase the chance of internal hallucination decrease the chance of external hallucination. Hallucinogens, believe-it-or-not, decrease your ability to externally hallucinate, because they make you internally hallucinate. Anything that‚Äôs a sedative decreases your ability to externally hallucinate, and may-or-may-not increase your ability to internally hallucinate. Anything that is any kind of stimulant increases your chances of external hallucination. There are some drugs that can be said to make you woozy or drowzy or spaced out, but are not quite sedatives, that may increase your ability to dissociate, and that may work by simultaneously increasing your heart rate while relaxing your muscles, or other ways- if it increases your ability to dissociate it can help with external hallucination. Anything that dilates your pupils will help with internal hallucination, but won‚Äôt help with external unless combined with a high heart rate.  

	Also, **repeated scanning of the sky** has a propensity to aid EVH, especially over many hours. This is something that anyone in the front seat of an aircraft is likely to be doing, hence their increased effect-successes. It can be similar for people on boats, or, in front of sensor-equipment bays/monitors. Looking through the historical data, it seems that just looking through a monitor of some kind can be enough to launch an EVH in the vicinity, outside of the ‚Äúvisual range‚Äù of the person, yet arguably ‚Äúwithin‚Äù their visual range if you consider that the monitor image, tied to real-world data, is a type of real-world extension of their eyesight. This issue bears some further discussion, but, for now, consider it a possibility.

	Here‚Äôs a very important point to make- when external hallucination happens, it **gives no feel** at all to the effecting person, no internal indication that lets them know that it happened. If it doesn‚Äôt happen at the center of your vision, you have to otherwise notice that it‚Äôs happened and know enough to understand what it is and be able to diagnose who ‚Äúlaunched‚Äù it, whether it was probably you or someone else nearby, based on who was most likely to have, using the info above. Without knowing all this, if you did one, you would have no idea that you had done it. You would just assume it was something else. This is why this phenomenon has gone on so long, historically, without anyone figuring out what it really is. I only figured this out by the accidents of my story first of all, and then by finding ways of increasing the effect to produce it intentionally, and then by studying it a lot. So, if you make one, you won‚Äôt feel anything different at all happen in your brain; you‚Äôll have no way of knowing if you‚Äôve just made one, unless it appears at the center of your vision. If it appears anywhere outside the center of your vision, you‚Äôll just have to look around and notice whether or not one of these things is floating around near you.  

**External Visual Hallucination Atmospheric Holograms**

**Definition**: EVH is an extremely rare, and difficult-to-produce phenomenon, which can nonetheless happen to anyone under the right conditions, and which regularly happens accidentally, wherein: a person‚Äôs brain, sensories, and body stimulate the atmosphere into producing a type of hologram, ranging from base-form spheres to other shapes, determined by the person‚Äôs subconscious. These are visible to the person, and to other people, and to sensors. They may reflect or emit various waveforms, or do so at times. These are able to be captured in photographs and on video, including in infrared. EH effects can also interfere with electronics or instruments.

**Range**: EVH will appear, and then disappear, anywhere within the visual range of the person producing them, and will be visible to that person and any other persons or sensor equipment also within visual or sensor range of the EVH atmospheric hologram (EVH-AH) produced. Consider that, if someone goes outside and looks up, the range and altitude of spots they can focus their eyes on is many miles, and, at night, even further. In general EVH can happen anywhere from inches in front of a person‚Äôs face to miles away in the atmosphere, and can scale in size accordingly, from a few inches wide if right in front of you, to a few feet wide starting about ten feet away from you, to tens or even hundreds of feet wide at maximum if far away. EVH-AH seem to be able to form behind or to the side of a person also, outside their direct visual path at the moment but within their visual ‚Äúrange‚Äù if they turn their head.

**Duration**: EVH-AHs can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours, but most last under a minute; many last only a few seconds.  

**Shapes**: There are three important categories for visual identification of EVH by shape:

**Spheres**\- These are the base effect of EVH. They can appear as singles or multiples, are relatively small-sized, and will either glow yellow, amber, or orange, or they will reflect opaque white or silvery. They also can sometimes show up in infrared-only, in which case they will be invisible to the naked eye but viewable on an infrared or a regular digital camera, which are somewhat infrared-sensitive.   

**Indistinct/**‚Äú**Geometric**‚Äù- Anything that isn‚Äôt a perfect sphere, and isn‚Äôt a specific recognizable form  

either. Any plain shapes, or strange, or hybrid-looking shapes fall into this category. Things that have outline and shading but not distinct features, or that have nonsensical hybrid features. More rare than spheres and the second relative level of the effect. The designs of these are actually subconscious abstractions of, or composites of, plain shapes and regular, every-day objects and sights that the effecting person has seen- a sort of accident of the subconscious. Sometimes these will flash, mimicking airplane lights, even moving similarly (spheres may likewise be an abstraction of the sun or reflections of the sun, stars, headlights, streetlamps and so forth, that you see peripherally/subconsciously throughout your day).

**Distinct**\- Any fully-formed image of any kind qualifies as the rarest category of EVH. Mostly EVH comes in its base form of spheres or in the step above that where the subconscious has started making a sort of image but only gone so far. At max, EVH can be a fully-formed image of some kind that has a complete set of thematic discerning details that stay stable while it‚Äôs visible. The give-away for distinguishing them is that they‚Äôre nonsensical, something that shouldn‚Äôt exist or shouldn‚Äôt be floating in the sky, also, that they appear out of nowhere and then disappear into nowhere after seconds to minutes. A building floating in the sky, a giant fish going across the sky, a cartoon character going across the sky, a flying saucer hovering. ‚ÄúGhost photos‚Äù also fall into this category. In the rare instances like this, you are seeing the maximum level of the effect of EVH.  

**Motions**\- Spheres, which are the base effect of EVH, will exhibit very clearly at times, three of six different peculiarities of motion that EVH are capable of: 1. Sitting perfectly **still** at a spot in the air, even with wind blowing. 2. **Hovering** around at a spot in the air, as if wind were blowing, without wind blowing. 3. Taking off, or abruptly changing course, going **nonsensical speeds**, about as fast as you can move your own center of vision across the horizon. 4. The ‚Äúdistinct‚Äù class can actually display **motion consistent with** the **theme** of the image. 5. The ‚Äúindistinct‚Äù class will usually do either a sort of slow and steady **float**, like a cloud, or: 6. It will do any type of nonsensical, **bizarre** movement (and/or semi-thematical motions, for half-formed images). Note though that any of the types can do any of these motion patterns.

**How to classify and report on events**: Observers should try to get footage; people should make sure to keep at least a cell-phone camera with them. Observers should classify EVH events by their shape: sphere-type, indistinct-type, or distinct-type, then, specifically describe the appearance and behavior, and note the duration. Observers should then indicate whether or not, as far as they know, they were the first person in the area who noticed the AH, and, if they were the closest person in the area to it. If someone else saw it first and pointed it out to them, they should indicate that, and who that person was, and that person‚Äôs report should also be collected. Everyone in an area where an EVH-AH happened should be interviewed for any effects they may have noticed. If an observer believes that they were the first who noticed it and/or were the person closest to it, then, they may have been the one who effected it, and so: they should then go on additionally to note: everything they can remember about what their mental, emotional, and physical states were like and what they were thinking and doing at the following times: when the event started, just before the event started, during and throughout the event, several hours leading up to the event, and, some general notes in kind about the time frame of several days leading up to the event. They should be asked how much sleep they got on each of the nights before the event. They should be asked if they were on any medications, stimulants, sedatives, or substances of any kind, and how much and how often on that day and the other days. Finally they should be asked how many EVH events they have seen in the past or perhaps done, and what types they were. No one should have any concern about reporting these or about doing these, even multiple times. EVH are normally harmless and can happen to anyone, even to someone who is fully sober and unperturbed, and even to someone who is competently doing their job. Collecting more data will help to verify and to study these further. It is likely that EVH-AH events are under-reported.

**National Security Risk**\- The foremost national security risk that these pose has to do with them being misidentified as plausible, or even as implausible, real-world threats. EVH-AH are subconsciously mind-controlled, albeit, as such, with a sort of lag and latency. The problem with thinking that they are ‚Äúa real, hostile, alien spacecraft‚Äù, or a ‚Äúreal, experimental technology of a hostile foreign nation‚Äù is that doing so can modify the behavior of the AH to act more like one of those things, causing the AH to ‚Äúturn on you‚Äù and start chasing the person producing it. A pilot who unknowingly produces, and sees, an EVH-AH, that they think is a hostile UFO, that then turns on them and starts chasing them like it‚Äôs a hostile UFO, is at risk of reacting accordingly and stalling and crashing their plane or running out of fuel and having to bail out while trying to out-maneuver it, or, inappropriately discharging their weapons at it. An operator at the terminal of an early-warning radar station is at risk of seeing an EVH-AH on their scopes and thinking it‚Äôs an incoming ICBM or ICBMs. It seems EVH-AHs are able to be picked up or locked onto by sensor equipment. A person confronting one should be confident that the EVH-AH will behave harmlessly toward them. Even distinct-type EVH-AHs imperfectly mimic real-world objects; they are easily discernible and they noticeably appear and disappear.

	People who are assigned to monitor real risks like those (incoming warheads in sovereign airspace, or, hostile foreign aircraft in sovereign airspace) should keep a short-list handy in their minds of the real-world behaviors of the objects they‚Äôre supposed to track, for instantly analyzing whether a blip is likely to be the real thing or is possibly an EVH-AH. For example, real ICBMs should only come from certain directions, i.e. the nations that possess them and would fire them, along certain paths, at certain speeds, and in certain numbers. Operators should be trained not to panic at anything that doesn‚Äôt have all of the attributes that it should have if it were the real thing. Similarly, for aircraft, a blip moving nonsensically may be an EVH-AH rather than novel and hostile foreign aviation technology. It should remain a policy to scramble jets to visually approach and confirm unidentifieds.

	Everyone who works in such jobs in the military should be told what EVH is. Briefing everyone on what these are will mitigate the risks associated with them, because, at outset the subconscious production of these things is emotionally ‚Äúneutral‚Äù, meaning, they basically don‚Äôt do anything other than float around for a few minutes and then disappear, if you understand what they are and therefore react to them emotionally ‚Äúneutrally‚Äù. Make sure to look for the give-away of appearance and disappearance, on sensor scopes or visibly (some ufologists used to think that this was evidence of alien crafts teleporting in and out, or using invisibility camouflage, or travelling to Earth at light speed and stopping on a dime, then taking off again at light speed from a standstill).

**How it works**\- It may turn out that external visual hallucination atmospheric holograms are actually something other than a type of hologram. I will discuss that. If they are what can be called a type of hologram, they probably work like this: the basic principle of **holography** is beam-splitting and self-interfering. Here is an extremely simplified analogy for those unfamiliar: You take a light beam. You look up close at it. You can see little wave lines going across it, where the actual light waves are. Now you take that whole beam and you split it into two beams, and you send them in different directions. Then, you take them and bring them back together, so that they‚Äôre crossing through each other somewhere. You look closely at that area where they‚Äôre crossing. Now, where all the little light waves from each of the two beams have crossed each other, there‚Äôs an ‚Äúinterference-pattern‚Äù where the waves have criss-crossed. What‚Äôs special about that interference pattern is that it‚Äôs actually a type of readable measurement of how far those two beams travelled away from each other and at what angles. In other words, you have a type of three-dimensional description of what the rest of the system of beams is doing. Now, if you reflect one of the two beams off of an object before the beams cross, you get a three-dimensional description of that object and its location in space, too, along with the rest of the beam info, at the interference pattern. This is not the finished hologram in a holography setup, but, this is how the holographic information is transmitted. In a holography setup, the final step of making the hologram product is to use a piece of special film that can develop interference patterns, and you shine the interference pattern onto that film and develop it; you‚Äôre left with a ‚Äúhologram‚Äù. Keep in mind the part about interference patterns and how the information is transmitted.  

	Now I‚Äôm going to show you how I found that the human body might actually utilize holographic principles, which is something that has never been looked for in anatomy. Here‚Äôs a short example: Shoot a light beam at the skull. Where the skull has two eyes, that beam will be split into two beams, going into the skull. Behind the eyeballs, that split beam crosses, in the optic chiasm, a piece of the body most people aren‚Äôt familiar with that sits between the eyes and the brain and is in the shape of an X. From there it goes into each side of the brain, where, as you know, you interpret these images three-dimensionally, and, you store them and are able to reproduce them, also in 3-d. The brain qualifies therefore as some type of holographic film. The eyes, optic chiasm, and brain may qualify as a beam-splitter, interference-pattern generator, and holographic film. Holography is done with coherent laser light, but perhaps incoming visible light is cohered or ‚Äústraightened‚Äù  within the eyeball, which can be said to have four back-to-back lensing layers when you consider the cornea, the aqueous humor, and the vitreous humor in addition to the lens. Or maybe incoming light is amplified anywhere in the eyes/optic chiasm/brain system, or amplified and resonated, making it coherent somewhere internally. If the optic chiasm‚Äôs wires actually cross through each other at all, it‚Äôs possible that an interference pattern is generated there for both sides. If it turns out that the optic chiasm has no holographic properties, and is as already described in anatomy as basically just two overlapping wires that do not interact, then the holographic process might be happening entirely in the brain, via the link between the two hemispheres: light from each eye shines into its corresponding brain hemisphere, where each side is also able to shine through into the other hemisphere through the linkage between them, thus interfering in both sides, to put it all simplistically. If the light gets converted to electronic signals or chemical-electric signals in the brain you could look for a corresponding type of interference.  

	If something like that is happening, here is how the whole thing can possibly work in reverse, to ‚Äúdevelop the air‚Äù into a hologram. First of all, appreciate that, when the brain receives information, it‚Äôs inputting, but when it replays that information, when it thinks, dreams, hallucinates, it‚Äôs essentially outputting that information. Second, appreciate that when you dream, the scenery is often lit to the level of full daylight. Somewhere within the system of your brain, optic chiasm, and eyes, light is being produced, visible within your eyeballs. If your eyes would be open when this would happen, they could be emitting some light, even if a small or reflected amount. Consider the ‚Äúred eye‚Äù effect of pupils in photographs- it‚Äôs assumed to be reflected light, but could the pupils be emitting light at all? What about infrared light? What if correlate interference patterns from both sides of your brain are re-emitted back out through the optic chiasm, emitted out the eyeballs in a split-beam configuration, and then converged on a single spot in the air where you are focusing your eyes? If it is a minute amount of interfered-light output, what if it‚Äôs a repeating signal, and the atmosphere is actually pumped by this until a hologram is achieved at a certain spot, much like how a laser‚Äôs medium is pumped, either electrically or photonically? If the retina is a type of photocell sensor, that takes in light at its front end and gives you electricity at its back end, consider this analogy: a microphone is another type of sensor, that takes in sound at the front end and gives you electricity at its back end. Reversed, it works as a speaker; if you give it electricity at its back end, it‚Äôll put out sound from its front end. Might it be that the retina works the same way? Also, has anyone ever checked whether a retina takes in light at its front and puts out light at its back? It may be that a retina is more like a fiber-optic harness, or like some photosensor that inputs and outputs light. Do you know how, when you close your eyes, there‚Äôs sort of a faint, static-like, color-glow to look at, just barely? This may be a ‚Äúreverse-ouput‚Äù from your brain, that turns brighter and focuses output images when dreaming. Perhaps what you‚Äôre actually seeing is the front side of your retina, reflecting off the inside of your lens, allowing the image to seem superimposed and focused in front of you.  All these are just some guesses I have about how external visual hallucination would work, holographically, if the product of external visual hallucination is indeed a hologram. Know that no one has otherwise figured out how to produce a ‚Äúfree-standing hologram‚Äù that projects into air, or, a ‚Äú360-degree hologram‚Äù that you can look at from all sides, or an opaque hologram, nor are there terms to distinguish such things. Nonetheless, this may be how it‚Äôs done; the product EVH-‚Äúobject‚Äù *seems* to be holographical.

	If EVH products are better described as purely ‚Äú**electrical**‚Äù, or, ‚Äústatic-electrical‚Äù, here is my guess as to what the analogy would be: first, consider this common system: a computer hard drive, wires, and a monitor: image-information stored on the hard drive, is connected electrically through the wires, to the monitor which can display the information. In our case, the air would have to be the monitor, but how would that be? And what would the wires be? Obviously, the brain would be the hard drive. Consider these: air is flouresce-able, if an especial current or discharge is run through it. Air will light up. Most people don‚Äôt realize that when they see lightning, they‚Äôre not ‚Äúseeing electricity‚Äù; electricity is, at all times and in any amounts, completely invisible. What they‚Äôre seeing is the air flourescing from how much voltage is being run through it. Also though they‚Äôre observing how much static electricity builds up in the atmosphere. If there‚Äôs that much sometimes, how much is there other times? Perhaps enough to play with. Consider also that air rainbows; it prisms, and it can glow the different plasma colors. There would be a way, essentially, to use the air as a ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù. Now, what would the ‚Äúwires‚Äù be? Consider that the body is completely conductive; that‚Äôs why we can get electrocuted. Consider that the outside of the body regularly becomes even more conductive via sweating. Consider that the body holds static charge, because, you can get static-shocked. Consider that the body‚Äôs signals are electrical, even if they‚Äôre chemical-electrical/mechanical. Consider that there‚Äôs no such thing as a perfect insulator; enough voltage will overcome any resistance, and even if air is normally considered insulative, it‚Äôs still anyway a conductor. Yet, air can get ionized, and ionized air is regularly conductive. A final consideration before we tie all these things together- neurons are a type of voltage cell, among other things. You have five billion neurons with 1/3 volt potential each. If they‚Äôre all connected to each other, there‚Äôs an argument for a possible series, parallel, or series/parallel circuit arrangement, even if there‚Äôs usually resistance between each neuron cell. What if, whenever your body needs to react quickly, or is unusually stimulated, the resistance lowers between the cells, opening up a totaled electrical potential? You‚Äôd have a lightning bolt‚Äôs worth. Even without that much, you‚Äôd still have a lot, perhaps enough to power the type of effect I‚Äôm describing. So- it would be possible that, I propose: when you dissociate you are essentially boosting the output signal of the brain by fully focusing on thought. If you do it while you have a high heart rate / blood pressure, you‚Äôre further boosting the output signal, systemically, because the brain is pumped by your circulatory system. Also, high heart rate / blood pressure make you sweat, increasing your surface conductivity, and, high heart rate / blood pressure may generate a static electric charge on their own due to an internal triboelectric (friction) effect of pumping blood and clenching muscles; perhaps, once this charge is built, and with the skin‚Äôs increased conductivity, the air around the body starts to get ionized by the body, becoming conductive. Now, it would be possible to consider that image-information in the brain is circuited electrically to some region of air that is flourescing, fulfilling the hard drive/wires/monitor analogy, and forming the EVH product in the air as a sort of shaped and colored electrostatic ball-lightning, electrically induced by the brain and body. I wonder also if the iron content of the blood magnetizes at all while pumping, perhaps contributing a changing magnetic field to this system.

If you let it out every time you're mad at the types of people you don't like, is it even helpful?
I feel like I'm taking the easy way out by ignoring people I don't like. But I learned that I should bottle it up. Okay, well, I'm pretty mad and I haven't talked to anyone in a long time. I feel like in life there's no way to avoid getting angry.  I feel like some people are doing it a lot better than me and they all become famous. I wanted to be famous 2 years ago and then I changed my mind after knowing what Jumex did after he blocked me. He made a music-watching video and I never heard of it because he blocked me. I guess what I'm trying to say is, so, in Madden I haven't been saying anything (win or lose) to the types of players I don't like (I wouldn't even say toxic, though). Today though, I messaged 3 people at least. I'm figuring out that, yeah, you just have to make it worse.
What do you think about parallel universes? Do they exist?
I readed so many theories about parallel universe.Man from Taured for example,that story amazed me and so i am asking you what do you think about that,do parallel universes exist?
The Link Between Nikola Tesla And The Aincent Egypt Pyrimads
The Pyrimads are energy power plants using frequency and natural energy (quartz, granite to conduct etc) 
Tesla picked the Colorado Springs as the soil was rich with quartz and his telsa tower was based off of the design of the pyrimads 

Tesla was called the smartest man alive by nikola tesla 
Tesla stated 3 6 9 and frequency is the key to the universe
and finally stated if we focus on non- physical science wed advance centuries in a mere decade 

so my first question is why has nobody tried to continue this research other than a 6 episode history channel documentary

and secondly WHY IS THIS NOT MORE WELL KNOWN KNOWLEDGE why is the Smithsonian so hyper focused on claiming the spinx and pyrimids are 4,500 years old and we came from hunter gatherers YET the amount of evidence actively being discovered is turning this beleif on its head yet even the conversion you are "crazy" and they become heavily defensive, isnt conversation and the exchange of ideas the whole point idk shits wild theres so much more

New cars kill switch - safety feature or government control?
Are you in the market for a new car? Well, before you sign on the dotted line, you should know about the latest technology being installed in new cars: the kill switch.

A kill switch is a security feature that allows the car's owner or a designated authority, such as a car dealership or police department, to remotely disable the vehicle's engine in the event that it is stolen. This can make it more difficult for a thief to start and drive the car, and can aid in the recovery of the vehicle. Additionally, some cars may have a kill switch as a part of a theft prevention system, which may also include other security measures such as alarms or tracking devices.

But here's the thing, while this technology may seem like a good idea, it also poses a serious risk to our privacy and freedom. The government and police have access to a network of satellites and tracking devices that can pinpoint your location at any given time. With the kill switch, they can now disable your car remotely, leaving you stranded on the side of the road. This gives them the ability to control your movements and prevent you from going where they don't want you to go.
But it's not just about control, it's also about money. Car manufacturers and dealerships are in on the scheme, and they're using the kill switch to drive up the prices of older cars. By making older cars more expensive, they're forcing people to buy new cars that have the kill switch. So, while you may think you're getting a good deal on an older car, you're actually paying more in the long run.

So, before you buy that new car, think about the implications of the kill switch. Is it worth sacrificing your privacy and freedom for a feature that may or may not even prevent car theft? It's important to weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision.

Adam and Eve story: the hidden connection to the earths cataclysmic events.

What Really Happened at the Sunspot Solar Observatory in 2018?
In 2018 The Sunspot Observatory, a Solar observatory in New Mexico, was abruptly shut down by swarms of federal agents. As a result, residents in the surrounding area were asked to evacuate their homes, most didn't even have time to gather their belongings.

[The official story](https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/crime/2018/09/20/child-porn-investigation-sunspot-observatory-closure-nm-new-mexico/1369569002/) was that The FBI had discovered the location was being used by a local janitor to receive and send child porn, but that doesn‚Äôt feel quite right to many people who feel that something else may have been discovered there. 

**Why? Let‚Äôs first look at how the FBI handled it:**
* Teams of heavily armed agents swooped in to the area in military Blackhawk helicopters, which is uncommon for scenarios like this. They reportedly also shut down all wireless networks within the area, leaving many people including members of the press and local police unable to send or receive information within a 16 mile radius of the observatory.

* They forced local residents to flee the area, turning the nearby town into an eerie ghost-town (I remember while this was all unfolding [watching videos by a local resident](https://youtu.be/tmUAwR55ZTw) who flew his drone through the town, showing there truly were no people anywhere to be found). 

* The FBI intentionally kept local police leadership in the dark. During the first few days the local police chief was asked by members of media what was happening and he very candidly said they wouldn‚Äôt tell him anything, which he thought was very unusual.

* The FBI was seen blocking off the local post office, with teams of agents going in and out of the station carrying bags and equipment. 

Pretty strange, right? Now if you take all of that and pair it with factthat all of this happened at a prominent solar observatory, you have an interesting story that‚Äôs ripe for conspiracy theories. 

Hypotheses range from what you‚Äôd imagine. From Aliens (classic), the discovery of a huge solar flare that could wipe out mankind, to foreign espionage (my preferred theory). 

At the time, it was heavily speculated that the observatory was technically capable of spying on the nearby top-secret US missile range, [White Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range). 

If US intelligence officers discovered a hostile nation was secretly using the observatory to spy on White Sands, it could pose a major national security threat. One that would justify Blackhawk helicopters, abrupt civilian evacuations, shutting down cell towers, blocking post offices, and keeping local authorities out of the loop. 

Also, in case you‚Äôre wondering, **no arrests were ever made in connection with the child porn crime**, despite the justice department knowing the suspect, claiming he was armed and dangerous, and allegedly obtaining his laptop.

Is anyone else familiar with this story? What do you think happened?

Why always Satanic rituals?
Why is it always Satanic rituals involving organised child abuse in conspiracy theories? Considering one of the tenants of the Church of Satan is not to harm children. 

Just seems strange because I've been reading about the 'satanic panic' period and it's all been disproved. 

Furthermore most ritualistic child abuse is performed to 'heal possessed children' by extremist catholics. And let's not forget the cover ups of organised child abuse. 

Interested in your thoughts.
My theory about Britney Spears and her conservatorship.. do you agree?
I believe that Britney has been suffering from a severe mental health issue since her mid 20s, which culminated in her being hospitalized in 2008. Most likely schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, which explains her hallucinations, paranoia (some of which is very justified), incomprehensible speech and incoherent thought patterns. 

Her father saw this as an opportunity to place her under conservatorship to ensure that she continued to have a career, because he knew it would be profitable and he would control her fortune under a conservatorship. 

In order to continue working, she needed to be functional and receive treatment for her condition, which she likely did not want because her paranoia made her distrustful of doctors' intentions. This enabled her to seem functional and "normal" to the public and her social media was heavily controlled. 

Her fans pushed for her conservatorship with no knowledge of her actual condition or how she was receiving medication she actually needed (even if she didn't want the treatment) and now that she is free and able to decide not to take her medication, we are seeing her schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder reflected in her behavior, and now everyone is surprised because they expected her to snap back into herself as we knew her in 2004. 

Now, I do believe the conservatorship was abusive and should not have been allowed to force her to work and perform when she was in no condition to, but it doesn't mean she did not have an actual mental health issue. 

This is far more likely to me than the idea that her father was able to get the state of California, many doctors, and the entire family to conspire to frame her as being mentally unstable when she actually was sane, and to give her medical treatment she did not need, when we see plenty of evidence that she needed that medication and still needs it now. 

She is suffering with no support system, she has pushed everyone away, and it is the fault of her overzealous fans who have no clue of her mental health issues and have no understanding of mental health at all. If something disastrous happens to her, it will be all their fault.

I was a Skeptic Until I Discovered the Florist Friars: A Hollywood Detective's Shocking Encounter with the Illuminati and the Secret Society Fighting Against Them
(Using a burner so I don‚Äôt ruin my own life)

I never believed in the Illuminati or secret societies. That was until I became a detective in Hollywood.

Assigned to investigate a string of high-profile heists, I found myself hitting a dead end. That is until I received a tip from an informant.

He told me about a group of magicians and propagandists known as the "Florist Friars." They were a group of avant-garde artists and businessmen who used a Robin Hood philosophy to make media to promote the individual freedoms of their audience against the tyranny of big tech and big media. They used their knowledge and resources to influence Hollywood's politics and economy to their advantage and to fight against the corruption and criminal activity of the Illuminati in the name of the common man.

Skeptical at first, I found myself diving deeper into the case. I soon realized that the Florist Friars were the only ones making any real progress against the Illuminati. With their help, we were able to infiltrate the inner circles and gather valuable intelligence.

But that was just the beginning. The secrets I uncovered during this case have stayed with me to this day. The true nature of the Illuminati and the Florist Friars is more sinister than you could ever imagine.

The Illuminati's reach was far greater than I ever envisioned. They controlled everything from the media to the government, pulling the strings behind the scenes to maintain their power and influence.

I soon realized that the Florist Friars were the only ones brave enough to stand up against them. They used their knowledge of magic and propaganda to infiltrate the Illuminati's inner circles, gathering valuable intelligence and using it to fight back against their nefarious plans.

But the Florist Friars weren't just fighting a battle against the Illuminati, they were also fighting a battle against time. The Illuminati were always one step ahead, always watching, always waiting for the opportunity to strike.

One night, as I sat with the Florist Friars, planning our next move, we received word that the Illuminati had uncovered our operation. We were compromised. We had to act fast if we wanted to survive.

We quickly devised a plan to infiltrate the Illuminati's stronghold and take them down once and for all. It was a risky move, but we had no other choice.

With the Florist Friars by my side, I infiltrated the stronghold and uncovered a network of tunnels and secret rooms that led deep into the heart of the Illuminati's operations. We found evidence of their dark rituals and twisted experiments. We found proof of their plans to control the world's population through mind control and manipulation.

But as we were about to make our escape, we were ambushed by the Illuminati's guards. We were outnumbered and outgunned, but the Florist Friars fought bravely, using their knowledge of magic to turn the tide of the battle.

The Florist Friars' ultimate weapon in the fight against the Illuminati was a comedy film that they released. The film was a satire that exposed the Illuminati's true nature and their nefarious plans to the public. It went viral, and the public finally saw the truth. The movie was a huge success, and it played a vital role in the ultimate downfall of the Illuminati.

The Florist Friars continue to fight against the Illuminati and other secret societies to this day. If you want to know more about their ongoing battle, check out their YouTube channel or website. They use comedy films to fight the Illuminati and share their message. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. www.youtube.com/@floristfriars/ or www.friars.florist/
Is George Santos a poorly planted political operative for Brazil?
Things are just NOT adding up with this guy, ESPECIALLY with regards to money.  Lying scandal after lying scandal, he's broke and keeps changing his stories about where different funding came from.  

He has ties to Brazil including criminal activity, but his being born in the US makes for a unique situation in which he could easily infiltrate the republican party without anyone caring that he is absolutely full of shit about EVERYTHING, while also somehow being able to get $500,000 from an outside source?!
Virginia federal kangaroo court
So I remember watching a video a couple years back that talked about the district court for the eastern district of Virginia and how this court system is controlled by the feds and has an even higher conviction rate than any other federal court in the nation and this is due to several factors like the jury pool being mostly government workers, federal agents, and other biased individuals. 

This is why most high profile federal cases involving whistleblowers, "terrorists", and others such as Julian assange are brought to this court district.

Does anyone know what YouTube video I'm talking about? I believe it was from an education related channel and not a conspiracy related one. Damn CIA plants won't let me Google with worthy results.
Is it possible that the Brazilian musical genre "Brazilian Funk" is the result of PsyOps?
 A musical genre that grew absurdly in Brazil in the last two decades, without a doubt, was Brazilian funk.  This type of music despite being popular throughout the country, it is very influential in the peripheries and slums, influencing fashion for example.  The problem is that 90% of music in this genre is extremely sexualized, in fact it is often sexually explicit.  It is a dumbing down art, which encourages and perpetuates certain behaviors, and since young people are the ones who listen the most, they are the ones who are most influenced.  These songs almost always encourage behaviors like sex with multiple women or multiple men, ostentation, intoxication, cheating, sexual revenge between people they dated, and everything bad imaginable.  And as if it couldn't get any worse, these songs constantly talk about "novinhas" (in free translation "young girls" like teenagers and children) in sexually explicit situations.  The media doesn't say anything, it even propagates funk, social networks are full of this type of music here in Brazil.  And it's practically impossible to openly criticize funk without being called Nazi and racist, since funk has Afro-Brazilian origins and is more popular among black people from the periphery.  There are so-called "baile funks" (open-air parties where funk music is played all night) ranging from pre-teens to 12 years old and adults.  It is not uncommon for very young girls at these parties to use drugs and have sex with adults, sometimes more than one at a time.  The truth is that these songs, over the years, normalized and stimulated very early sexualization.  The dances in these songs are based on movements that mimic sex.  My question is: has the growth and perpetuation of this musical style, including its propagation through media such as TV channels, been maintained by people or organizations on purpose, giving the impression that it is a genuine artistic movement?  Is this a plan to normalize the sexualization of children and adolescents in an undeveloped country?  would this be a way to take away the artistic sensibility of young people and adults?
Where does this mysterious shaft lead in the Great Pyramid? In a video from 2002 they drill through a door that they found in this shaft...but find another door behind it. The project was shut down afterwards.
There is an 8-inch square shaft that goes 200 feet starting from the Queen's chamber until it ends at two small doors.

It has never been revealed what is the behind the [second door in the pyramid shaft](https://youtu.be/C79Vfxqsg5s?t=873) (link is timestamped to when the robot's camera looks through) after a robot was sent up and drilled through the first door in 2002.

As soon as the camera looks through the drilled hole, you can see an image. After this was revealed, the entire project was shut down. Zawi Hawass told the reporter in the video it was cracks when she mentioned markings on the second door. The project was silenced after this, maybe even filled in like the Egyptian authorities have done with other mysterious entrances.

What is the truth? What is being hidden? The King's and Queen's chambers feel like red herrings. Please share any theories you've read about and, if possible, why you believe them.
Conspiracy Theory: Our cardinal directions are mixed up!
Due to there being no ‚Äútop‚Äù or ‚Äúbottom‚Äù to the universe it is entirely possible that what we think is north could actually be south, and vice versa. Being ‚Äúright side up‚Äù can only be determined if you have reference points to designate as the top or bottom, for all we know, we can‚Äôt determine a true top or bottom of the universe so there is no true upside down in this universe.
Genuine Flat Earth Questions
With this questions, my intention is **not to make fun of anyone's theories, beliefs and opinions**. I'm just **curious** about flat earth answers on these questions.

1. What about the planets? I've seen a lot of illustrations about the flath earth but why is the earth the only one flat and the sun, moon and planets spheric?
2. How would the "truth" change our lifestyles? I mean, if suddenly a 100% irrefutable proof that the earth is flat or round appears, how would that change our current lifestyles? I mean, we already have jobs to do, planes to travel and internet to entertain ourselves, idk if that truth would change any of that, I think it'll all be the same. But I'm no expert so what do you think?
3. Why would the government or NASA (or whoever) want to change the Earth's real shape? I mean, if it's flat and they say it's round, or it's round and they say it's flat, what to they gain? I just don't see how they can win power or money by making people think the earth is one shape or another? Can someone explain?
4. I've seen the meme of the asteroid hitting the planet and destroying the dinosaurs but since it was a flat earth they just flew away. But I wondered, what is Flat Earth supporters' opinions on the existence of dinosaurs, do they fit in in that theory? their extinction was because of something else?

Once again, to clarify, With this questions, my intention is **not to make fun of anyone's theories, beliefs and opinions**. I'm just **curious** about flat earth answers on these questions.

Common Features of Fascism

Turkey working with Russia from inside NATO.
RECENT BACKGROUND:

Turkey has been hindering Sweden from joining NATO all of 2022, on purpose putting ridiculous demands that requires Sweden to break it‚Äôs foundational laws in order to join NATO, which they know we will never do.

And now with the Erdogan doll that was hung upside down in Stockholm Sweden, Erdogan has condemned Sweden and has tried to force us to punish people for something that isn‚Äôt a crime here, or else we don‚Äôt get to join NATO, meanwhile they‚Äôve been doing an ethnic cleansing of Kurds for years. 

Now in response to this a Danish asshat named Rasmus Paludan who isn‚Äôt a representative of Sweden in ANY way, just a random provocative dude, decided to burn the Quran outside of the Turkish embassy in Stockholm, and because of this, Turkey has come out and said that because he hasn‚Äôt been punished (he hasn‚Äôt committed a crime in Sweden) we won‚Äôt get to join NATO. Erdogan also knows our highest court is independent from politicans, politicians can‚Äôt do shit to punish Paludan.

Erdogan‚Äôs ultimatum‚Äôs are absolutely ridiculous. I can‚Äôt help but to think that Erdogan is working with Putin, trying to use anything he can to block us from joining NATO.


CONSPIRACY:

Question is why? Are we the next target? We have control over the baltic sea, if Russia wages war on us, which is easy if we aren‚Äôt backed up by NATO countries, we are fucked, and in turn, the entire Baltics are fucked, being sandwiched between occupied Ukraine, Russia, and the then Russian controlled Baltic sea. Slavic countries would perhaps be next, and if they formed an alliance with Turkey who can also delay NATO from the inside with VETO right, then we are truly fucked in the west.

Now if this eastern alliance also included Putin friendly middle eastern countries with oil money then the west could seriously be screwed.

I‚Äôll just pray that Ukraine outlasts Russia.


Edit:
UPDATE 27 Jan.

Al-Azhar institution in Kairo wants a global boycott towards Sweden after Paludan‚Äôs book burning, claiming we are ‚Äùhiding behind an immoral flag called freedom of speech.‚Äù
Classified Documents being used to prevent Presidental Candidacy
Preface: This isn't a post supporting either political party.  I don't like the orange man, but this theory is in regards to the government at large, not specific individuals.



The Justice Department hasn't successfully gotten anything to stick to DJT... except the classified document cache.

What if Biden accepts some form of light punishment (like not being able to run again)  for his punishment?  

Republicans would just laugh it off... so to make things nonpartisan,  Pence accepts the same...


Now all of a sudden there's a new law and a precedent to prevent the orange guy from holding office.  Done and done.


This one seems pretty blatant to me.

James Webb Telescope Findings

Are they with holding information? 

Hopefully those Q's will be answered with time but always fun to put the tin foil hat on.

Regret and Karma are two sides to the same coin.
I know you guys like politics, but I thought I would put religion on blast with this one.

Christianity lives in a cavern of Hindu Karma.

What I mean by this is that if you knowingly perform an act requiring karma retribution on your soul, you will have regret.  You will remember, because you'll always be on the lookout for when that karma will come back on you one day.

The whole concept of regret relates directly to whether or not you'll enter heaven or hell.  A concept bastardized by many a religious institution.

Why Did the NYPD Film People Leaving a Drake Concert?

The Fellowship
 Is it a coincidence that sitting at the highest point of the Potomac River, the 4.4 million dollar mansion known as The Cedars, owned by George Mason IV, one of three men who refused to sign the U.S. Constitution, is now owned by the shadowy group known as the Fellowship? 

Definitely not. 

The Fellowship trying to rot America from within by exerting the influence of elitist Christian fundamentalism and dark money throughout the nation and the world. The Fellowship, also known as ‚ÄúThe Family‚Äù and the ‚ÄúInternational Foundation‚Äù, is a U.S.-based religious and political organization founded in 1935 by Abraham Vereide. The Family organizes Washington politicians into intimate "prayer cells", influences foreign policy, inspired the creation of the president's Annual Prayer Breakfast in 1953 and sponsored President George Bush's faith-based policy of transferring social welfare responsibilities to religious groups in 2001.

As Paul wrote to the Romans (13:1): Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.

This is a defining directive for The Fellowship. They view themselves as divine leaders of the world. The Family has facilitated aid and links to US industry for dictators such as Papa Doc of Haiti, Siad Barre of Somalia and Indonesia's Suharto. It finds "friends" in Congress for powerful foreigners and influences foreign policy. The push for a "government led by God" (meaning a theocracy lead by the Fellowship) is done through secret alliances and in defiance of democratic processes. They work to keep populations around the world uneducated, subservient, and dependent on them. It grooms children into their warped belief system to make them easier to control ([https://fef.churchcenter.com/groups/family-ministries/fellowship-kids](https://fef.churchcenter.com/groups/family-ministries/fellowship-kids)). It is working to corrupt the Supreme Court to push their agenda.

Through the use of their ‚ÄúPrayer Cells‚Äù they have exerted their control over every aspect of your life. 

These prayer cells can also take the form of some churches. These churches play a heavy role in keeping the population in control. When they need to keep the oil wells pumping, they use the churches to cause doubt about climate change. [https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/11/17/how-religion-intersects-with-americans-views-on-the-environment/pf\_2022-11-17\_religion-climate\_04-02/](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/11/17/how-religion-intersects-with-americans-views-on-the-environment/pf_2022-11-17_religion-climate_04-02/)

Hold your local churches accountable.

They have been working behind the scenes for decades. Why does Christian Fundamentalism keep resurfacing? Ever since the 'Scopes Monkey Trial' of 1925, the media has been declaring Christian fundamentalism dead every few years, and it just keeps coming back. The press can see religion when it is at the level of the working class and poor; it has a much harder time seeing it when it is infused at the top levels.

Maybe Christian fundamentalism is more than a set of Christian beliefs. Maybe it is a tool, used by the elites, to keep control of the world and themselves in power.

In 1985, President Ronald Reagan said about the Fellowship, "I wish I could say more about it, but it's working precisely because it is private."

The Family began when the founder (Abraham Vereide) had a vision, in which Harry Bridges, an Australian labor organizer who organized the biggest strike in American history, a very successful strike, is a Satanic and Soviet agent. He then networked among business and civic leaders in order to ‚Äúremove‚Äù the problems that Harry was creating. 

It worked, and the list of figures involved has filled books. (https://books.google.com/books/about/The\_Family.html?id=NVmcx-8zdGEC)

Doug Burleigh is a key figure in the organization and has taken over organization of the National Prayer Breakfast (the one event that the public knows the organization by) since the death of his father-in-law, Doug Coe. Prior to that, he had a leadership role in the organization and had spoken at the Russian prayer breakfast. Burleigh stated in 2017 that "a breakthrough in relations between Russia and the US is about to occur" Just after Trump made backroom deals with Russia, and gave Putin a path to invade Ukraine. Maria Butina, who has admitted to working as an undeclared Kremlin agent, helped arrange for five Russians chosen by a top official to attend the 2017 National Prayer Breakfast which she also attended before she was indicted and imprisoned.

Doug Coe has been quoted to say, "We work with power where we can, build new power where we can't." He cites Hitler and Mao when he said, "There's this constant thread and reverence for what essentially is an authoritarian concept of God, that what matters most in one's concept of God is obedience."

How do we know about all this? The Los Angeles Times examined the Fellowship Foundation's ministry records and archives (before they were sealed), as well as documents obtained from several presidential libraries and found that the Fellowship Foundation had extraordinary access and significant influence over U.S. foreign affairs for the last 75 years. https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230345/http://www.toobeautiful.org/lat\_020927.html 

Since then, the Fellowship has been busy attempting to suppress knowledge of their organization. Having mostly failed at this, they are now attempting to rebrand themselves to seem innocuous and innocent. 

Do not be fooled. They will stop at nothing until they have brought their Christian theocracy to fulfillment: a world in which we will serve our masters unquestioningly, with no control over our environment, bodies, or sexuality. We will offer up to them our hard labor for a pittance of their wealth as good Christians should be subservient, capitalist, never questioning, and childlike (Matthew 18:3) sheep (Mark 6:34).
Electric cars are the world's biggest greenwashing /grift
I believe that electric cars are the biggest greenwashing/eco-grifting scheme on the planet. Even though they pollute less, you still have to deal with the waste that comes from it like rubber and subsidize asphalt construction for these cars, leading to more pollution. Further, you need to extract lithium and other rare earth metals to get these cars, leading to lots of pollution. My point is that I don't believe any car, whether gas-guzzling or otherwise, is sustainable, and instead of going forth with Electric cars, we need to talk about real sustainable options for transit like trains, trams, bikes, walking, or buses.

I think sports are rigged, but only sometimes and only some sports
Either sports are rigged, or referees are just terrible. I honestly think factthat the NBA and NFL refuse to use automated technology and still use random old people to call fouls leaves so much space for rigging and changing outcomes. Why are we relying on the sight lines of 60 year olds to say where the ball should be, whether there was contact and whether that contact warrants a foul? 

There is illegal contact on almost every play in these sports, but the refs get to choose when to selectively call it, and it‚Äôs so obvious they basically get to decide the outcome on some of these plays. 

Why can‚Äôt we just have automated technology to call the fouls, review the line decisions (first down, out of bounds etc) instead of adding so much subjectivity to it? In tennis and soccer they have review systems that actually allow the correct call to be made automatically. 

Another thing, is that criticizing any referee or refereeing decision will lead to fines >10K, so basically no player or coach will ever do it. 

So just to review, these old people are deciding the outcome of the games and they are basically never cross-checked by AI or any available technology, and if they get the call wrong, there‚Äôs no accountability. If you question the call you are fined into silence. 

Idk if my reasoning comes through but I think there‚Äôs something here. Thanks for reading, I‚Äôm just bored at work and hope to discuss this

Elon is a fraud
Not in the way you think, but in the same way Trump is. There are a great number of people out there at are understanding more and more that the game we play are not meant to be fair. ‚ÄúJustice for tee, but not for me‚Äù. We watched Trump, and other people get kicked off of social media platforms. People started to think these platforms were controlled by the far-left, so what do the elite do? they put a guy to represent the far-right, and do the same thing, but for the far-right people. It is all meant to be a fake. Elon may be the false prophet, as known in the bible. His tech advances may bring to life something that we have never seen before. His job right now with twitter is to keep us thinking the game is fair, to distract from what is really going on.

Strange Flyer (conspiracy theories, science,gang-stalking, speech, therapy, biology, art)
Okay. So this afternoon I walked out to my car to meet a friend for mimosas and to chat. When I got to my car, I found the attached flyer under my windshield wiper. This was in the parking lot of my apartment complex and no other cars had it on. I‚Äôm hoping to find out where I can do any research on the topics located on the flyer‚Ä¶ and the author asked for it to be posted to be scrutinized. It‚Äôs interesting. Idk if this means anything or if it‚Äôs all fun. Honestly, I‚Äôve had a shit weekend and getting this has really made my day. Playing ‚Äòyes, and‚Äô with an anonymous flyer could prove to be fun. Although, it‚Äôs giving me conspiracy, mind reading, MKULTRA vibes. 

I‚Äôm a little nervous but mostly interested. So I‚Äôm posting this to several subreddits to see what I can gather. Read through the flyer and let me know what you think (sorry about the mimosa glass shadow on the paper).  I‚Äôm also trying to send this out to lots of different subreddits too that I think can help me collect information.

Is it BS? Is it interesting? Are any ideas valid? How do these topics connect to each other? Why? How come my windshield? Does anyone else know anything about this? Have other people found this? Are babies delicious? Does ketchup really fix everything?  Is someone gangs-talking me? Or‚Ä¶ what?

Any information helps me unravel at this very interesting thread.

Trump is a hired actor.
This theory has really been on my mind lately. Trump, who was a long time dem, and the host of the number TV show for half a decade. Was hired by the deep state, to play a role. He claimed to be an outsider, which actually a majority of Americans want, but he is actually the biggest insider ever. He is played a part, some one else is making the script, my guess is 3 things. 1 he get killed, as the simpson prediction. 2, he loses the 2024 election and tries to officially over throw the government, and it works and the NWO replaces our government, 3. He is elected president but some how dies from age related, putting the VP. Who will also make the NWO a thing.

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has a link to a video that made quite an impression on me.

It then shows the voyage route on an alternate map- which implies the existence of giant ice walls surrounding the perimeter of our world.

Why are zombie apocalypse movies so common ?
I might not be the only one who feels that there are way too many movies and television series based on the idea of zombie apocalypse. Is there any specific reason behind this or are the directors and producers just milking the idea of the apocalypse . I feel after watching so many movies and series if any day it does happen (I hope it doesn't) , then we might be getting ideas from these movies and series how to survive it and continue living a very uncomfortable life after the events take place.
Dollar General and money laundering
While in a fatigue induced rambling session on a long drive. I noticed the huge amounts of Dollar Generals with one or 2 cars in the parking lot.

I've been searching for a new location for my employer and am now amazed by how expensive a decent location with 3 phase power and a parking lot is. That got me wondering about how they can do what they do. Yes, I know they pay low wages.  But, let's say that building is 10 grand or more a month, their products are low priced, so low profit. The average person probably spends under $10. Their competitors beat them in every single category other than location convenience.

So my thinking is that this company of shitty little stores  having a market cap of 55.1 Billion dollars is absurd. 

Don't worry about the numbers, just the concept.Say a store  makes $2000 a day profit. Their accounting department adds in a grand of dirty money, and bam  money is added to the system without raising eyebrows. Everyone will just assume their low payroll costs and high volume are the key.

Now multiply that times 18,700. That amount of money means they don't work for cartels. They own a few cartels.

Or is there another explanation?

What's the actual mystery behind sacrificed headless goats around Atlanta, GA?
I've come across several carcasses in the area with headless features in the woods at local parks, and it continues to be an issue brought up at local town hall meetings. There's an article in the New Yorker discussing how frequently it happens, and I find it extremely bizarre that nobody seems to step in to do anything about it. Thoughts?
Let‚Äôs talk vampires
 
A thing commonly found across cultures are‚Ä¶ vampires. Creatures with pale, ice-cold skin, whom you can encounter only at night. In some tales it‚Äôs human-like, but not quite there yet. Awkward and without the ability to understand social bonds. In others, an irresistibly charming and beautiful (and admittedly in some they can take on almost any form). 

An existence of vampires would perhaps explain our uneasiness around human-like but not quite human things - aka. the uncanny valley. The uncanny valley suggests that sometime ago there was an evolutionary need for this particular reaction. Going further we can theorise that there was a predator, who looked like us and hunted humans. Perhaps it emerged from a genetic mutation, a virus, a prion or maybe it was a specie completely separate from our. 

Alright so onto the next stage. There is a book series called missing 411 (Mr Ballen talks about a lot of cases described in these books). Described in this book are hundred of well-documented cases of people going missing in national parks in some very strange circumstances. People essentially vanish in seconds. You could be hiking with your friend, turn around and they have disappeared into the thin air. Some other strange things include kids being found days later, unharmed in the middle of forest with clean clothes or people being find miles away with no recollection of what happened and no realistic means of getting to where they were found. There are hundreds of police reports and eye-witness accounts online. 

We have all seen this infamous map: https://preview.redd.it/lv4mw88hwdv31.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8a5e2edddd2ea7eabab8801ecf59200961fb4082 . But there is another map it lines up with it really well - the map of US national parks https://morethanjustparks.com/list-of-national-parks-by-state/ . And who established national parks? That‚Äôs right, Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt‚Äôs was an avid hunter and what he knew there is something we should be scared of? Or maybe something we should bother. 

Now, my theory is that in densely populated areas like Europe vampires have died out a couple of centuries ago. Perhaps humans caught on and started posing a threat. Now onto North America. In the Native American culture a creature known as Wendigo has been feared for generations. Apparently, many native Americans take this very seriously and do not say the name of this creature aloud. There are recorded accounts of this online, consisting mostly of strange human noises. In mainstream American culture, they are also known but as skinwalkers. 

And so the theory: the North American national parks are one of the last habitats for vampires.

Why people believe in conspiracy theories and how to respond

It‚Äôs not an ‚ÄúAnti-White‚Äù agenda, it is a *Divide and Conquer* agenda
John Ehrlichman, Richard Nixon‚Äôs advisor, stated that the true purpose of the *War on Drugs* was to drive a wedge between ‚Äúthe Blacks‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Hippies‚Äù for the purpose of voter manipulation.

Aleksandr Dugin, the white-supremacist advisor to Putin, mimics these sorts of ideas in his 1997 book *Foundations of Geopolitics*:

> Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements ‚Äì extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S.‚Äù

The culture of racial animosity has a destabilizing and dividing effect, and it conveniently disproportionately affects poor and leftist communities.

And then you signal-boost the most vocally divisive members of those communities, who eat up this rhetoric because it has the facade of being ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù and ‚Äúpro-POC.‚Äù  They are actually playing right into the hands of powerful white-supremacist policy makers, who are simultaneously supporting Neo-Nazi groups as well.

The poor then self-divide, self-segregate, and self-ghettoize.  This results in voter manipulation, as the self-divided poor never have a single political agenda or figure to rally behind.

It simultaneously has the convenient effect of convincing poor and working class people who identify as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù to vote against their own class interests.  They see the animosity, they feel alienated, then they vote for conservative politicians who parrot this idea that there is an ‚Äúanti-white agenda.‚Äù

The true agenda is more convoluted: it is to create general instability.  This is why you also see a lot of pro-violence rhetoric that is signal-boosted in the fringe political groups on both the right and the left.  Forget voting: you‚Äôre not really ‚Äúfighting the system‚Äù unless you‚Äôre being violent.  As if the system itself hasn‚Äôt long since figured out how to take advantage of this exact sentiment and turn it to it‚Äôs own benefit.  (And this is how you end up with such ridiculous rallying cries as ‚Äúpacifism is white supremacy.‚Äù)

This has a number of time-proven effects:
- it is less likely for the poor and working class to vote together, which:
- makes it easier to install corrupt politicians, which:
- makes it easier to privatize resources and get rid of human rights and environmental regulations.
- the instability/chaos/violence makes the general population more accepting of more militaristic responses.  The resultant *pearl clutching* is a boon for the recruitment of GOP members.
- it strengthens the resolve amongst the right-wing religious cults, such as the Christian Nationalists, and inspires them to have ludicrous amounts of offspring, and to align their cults more aggressively with specific political agendas.

This maintains a very specific condition in the United States, where it is semi-third-world.  Just above the third world countries, and just below the more regulated, developed social democracies.  This creates the perfect amount of deregulation, by which the oligarchs of the world can utilize the military resources, and the financial resources, that exist in the ‚ÄúWild West‚Äù United States, and then funnel all of the money they make back out of the country to private off-shore accounts.

The Government is Pushing Electric Cars to Eliminate the Middle Class
Five states, Oregon, New York, Massachusetts, Washington, and California, have already attempted to ban the sale of gas cars. As the trend of environmentalism continues, more left-leaning states will, presumably, continue to do this. Electric vehicles are expensive, inefficient, and lacking infrastructure (you can't just charge it wherever), and the battery production is worse for the environment than gas cars. The question is, is the government aware of this? I say absolutely.

First, we need to establish what is objectively wrong with electric cars. Although some gas cars are more expensive than electric, [electric tends to be more expensive](https://www.caranddriver.com/shopping-advice/a32494027/ev-vs-gas-cheaper-to-own/) because of the fad, making them far too expensive for anyone except wealthy people. Additionally, [charging times are inconvenient](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/electric-truck-will-take-a-week-to-charge) to the average working American. Electric trucks do not have the range that gas trucks have. Lastly, [they are terrible for the environment](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/20/electric-car-batteries-what-happens-to-them). Therefore, electric vehicles have flaws so severe that they are unsuitable for both the average American and the environmentalist - [despite their claims otherwise](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/electric-vehicle-myths).

If electric cars are so bad, why would states try to ban gas cars? The answer is simple - to eliminate the middle class. If the middle class can't drive because their cars are illegal, they can't go to work. If they buy a newfangled electric car, they're able to. But, if they can't afford it, they can't make money. If they can't make money, they will be unable to support their families. It's an awful plan, but the states that are trying to ban gas cars have already shown their disregard for the poor - what with homelessness problems, drug problems, crime problems, and the like - for the sake of "progress" and "going green," of course.

In conclusion, state governments want to ban gas cars to eliminate the middle class.

The internet in my shared apartment wasn't working properly for 3 days, I checked the router in my flatmates room to find out why...
This is my first time posting on r/conspiracytheories and after reading the rules I think this is the right place for what's coming up next...

As stated in the title, I'm living in a shared apartment with two other people. We are all in our late 20's. I had trouble with my WI-FI (and even Ethernet) connections on all of my devices, but I couldn't restart the router, because it's in my flatmates room (that's the only place in our apartment with a connection for the device) who wasn't at home for the past few days and had his room locked up during that time. He came back home yesterday and I went into his room to check on the router, just to find the obvious reason why I'm experiencing heavy connecctivity issues.

https://preview.redd.it/decon3f6iyca1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=69ec73889016103caa3a2cac82dc3410152e5454

He was talking a lot about some "real news" and alternative media lately, which I didn't take to serious. I only had one "bigger" discussion with him before about one of the topics that he is follwing, just to come to the conclusion that you can't really use logic or actual facts while speaking to him when it comes to certain rumors, events or believes.

The only thing I did so far, after finding the router like that 10 hours ago, was actually just asking **WHY** he wrapped our router in tin foil. His dead serious response to that was that he read about the government using some kind of secure internet to spy on regular people by injecting nano robots into their vital systems through WI-FI rays, and that wrapping up the WI-FI router can protect you from those robots. I really didn't know how to respond anything to that, which lead to me creating this post now, since I honestly don't know what to do or say, to get the internet running again in our apartment while also providing some support for him and his current state of mind.

Any ideas, thoughts, or questions are highly appreciated!
NFL Rigged?
We all know how big the NFL is and how much money and viewers they bring in..

The NFL has also stated they're an entertainment business.. and last weekends game with Trevor Lawrence mentioning "you can't write a crazier script." But take that with a grain of salt..

This weekend Bills VS Bengals and Chiefs vs Jags.. However, the NFL is already selling Bills vs Chiefs championship game tickets like the two teams have already won.

Why sell tickets to people to a game that doesn't even exist? This is just my two cents.. thoughts?
The Billionaire Davos Summit in 2023 Proves COVID-19 is Real, Still Happening, and Dangerous
Despite their attempts to assure the world that everything is ok. The billionaires at the Davos Summit happening right now in Switzerland proves the billionaires very much do worry about COVID-19 and that the pandemic is still a cause for concern. Unfortunately for us, it hurts their bottom line, so they want things to appear to go back to normal as quickly as possible. While thousands die every week. 

You might be saying, "but hardly anyone is wearing a mask!" that's because everyone at Davos is constantly PCR tested and provably uninfected at all times. Also, they know that only the infected really need to wear a mask, as that is where the bulk of protection comes from (stopping water droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 from traveling far).   


In the image links below, you will see countless COVID-19 measures including:

* HEPA filters everywhere
* UV sanitation devices
* Cold temperatures (all these billionaires are wearing coats inside all day)
* Constant PCR testing

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, billionaire-led misinformation still spreads like wild-fire in right-wing circles, a group of people billionaires can rely on to support their interests. People are being tricked into believing that the COVID-19 is the conspiracy. In reality, the conspiracy is the coverup of how bad COVID-19 actually is.   


Respiratory viruses are no joke. They do more than just make us sick for a week or two. They scar our lung tissue, inflame our neurons, and interfere with our cardiac function - sometimes permanently. Soon-to-be mothers infected with respiratory viruses during pregnancy causes certain forms of mental illness and changes the way children develop. Viruses are a problem not the vaccine. Almost everything anti-vaxxers claim vaccines cause, are things that viral and bacterial infections cause themselves. Makes you wonder why these people don't want others to be protected from infection.

I thought absolutely nothing of it until I then read an article that he ‚Äúdied‚Äù but is he? Is all of this just made up? Did he genuinely catch something going on up in the woods? Was the cia following him and then eliminated him? Or was this us seeing someone play out a serious psychological breakdown on camera and then kill him self? Can I get your theories on this?

The odds the NSA actually shut down the electronic spying programs on American citizens are basically 0, right?
The way the NSA and the CIA is compartmentalized they basically have express legal authority to lie to anyone, even the President (especially the president).  So, wouldn't it make sense that they temporarily paused the programs, increased the level of security clearance, down-sized the work force for these programs (so there's less people that know), then continued spying once the heat was off?  What incentive would they have to actually stop spying?  It's not like anybody got in trouble when Snowden exposed them.

Conspiracy Theories Drive House Republican‚Äô Agenda

Meat-Alternative Companies and the Media Want to Ban Meat
Howdy! This is my first post here, so please forgive me for any mistakes I make.

I believe that some meat-alternative corporations and media outlets are trying to outlaw meat in the United States of America. Meat-alternative corporations know that their alternative is nonsense, but because of the environmentalism trend, they continue to sell their lies. The media, with its headline-chasing nature, continues to support radical environmentalist views.

Of course, there needs to be evidence for every theory.

1. Environmental "Impact"

For decades, some vegans and vegetarians have said blamed the meat eater for climate change. What with cattle emissions and animal-rights organizations and all, it seems likely that meat is bad. This is wrong. Not only is a balanced diet better than veganism, veganism actively harms the environment.

Veganism-- or to be more specific, the method of obtaining vegetables--  has a higher carbon cost for the environment. Oftentimes, vegans will claim that natural meat farming is more costly than natural plant farming. That holds some ground until you remember what plowing does to it. The carbon cost of plowing is hardly mentioned, but in a study of 37 days, the effects of plowing on poorly drained grassland and the resulting CO2 emissions peaked at 6.91g per hour per square meter. That‚Äôs 68.17g of carbon per year per square meter. Converting to cubic meters, that ends up as 562.8465g/yr/cubic meter. That's not taking into account other plant products. In a rushed, money-driven corporation, they will not care about proper plowing.

Alternatively, cows, the best-tasting meat animal, produce 2300kg of CO2 (cows produce methane, but using a commonly attributed claim that [methane emissions are 23 times as worse as carbon](https://timeforchange.org/are-cows-cause-of-global-warming-meat-methane-co2/), we get 2300kg of CO2 as a rough equivalent) per year per cow. A cow on average is about 7 cubic meters, meaning a cow produces 328.6g/year/cubic meter; and when subtracting it ends up as a difference of over 200g.

Summary:

* Plant farming can have a higher impact on the environment, especially when done improperly.

1. Meat Alternatives are Undigestable

According to multiple news sources about a study from the Chalmers University of Technology, popular meat-based alternatives cannot be digested by the human body due to high phytate levels. This phytate prevents the body from absorbing and using the high iron content of meat alternatives. Of course, money-hungry meat-alternative corporations will never acknowledge this.

Animal-based meat product, on the other hand, is a nutritious and delicious part of a complete breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Unless cooked improperly, meat can be digested.

Summary:

* Meat alternatives are high in iron, but can't be digested.
* Food tastes better than manufactured meat.

1. Why Would They?

I'm not going to lie. I have no idea why anyone would want to ban meat. There is not much better than grilling a hot dog or burger or making barbeque sauce for some ribs. Climate change is a big issue, but meat is not and will never be a cause of it. However, I have some ideas that make sense.

* Environmentalism, what with the unsustainable electric car trend and "climate trauma", has become a trend over the last few years. The media chases trends, just like with other social issues.
* Meat-alternative companies know that, unless they make big changes, they are destined to fail. So, they're spinning lies to try to get meat banned. Who keeps posting those ballot title to ban hunting and fishing in Oregon?
* Meat-alternative companies are companies. They prioritize profit over quality. That's why they won't admit their product won't work - just like electric car infastructure.

1. Who is They?

Norway, Poland, and Wales, countries normally unaffiliated with America, have recently implemented or attempted to implement a policy in which school-aged children are fed *bugs* instead of meat. Now, I'm not mad at Europe, but factthat governments tend to borrow from each other (like with communism) means we should be a bit more wary of America's government.

I always try to see the best in people and not assume things, but I'm definitely worried they'll try and put bugs in our kids' food -- Oregon and California, some of the most environmentally cautious states, are trying to ban the sale of gas cars despite the cost and lack of infrastructure of electric vehicles. factthat some of our states are going out of their way to ban the most efficient form of transport the average American has is ridiculous, and I'm unsure of where it will go next.

Summary:

* We should be a bit more wary of America's government, governments borrow from each other all the time and Poland feeds kids bugs to help the environment.

In conclusion, there are lots of reasons, both for-profit and for-government, why people would want to ban meat. The environmentalism trend shows no signs of stopping and is heavily influencing some of the media. Meat alternatives cannot be digested, yet the companies keep pushing them. Lastly, governments are already trying to feed kids bugs instead of meat.

Thank you for reading this, and I hope you all have a lovely day.
Are they listening to us?
I was hanging out with friends at one of the friend‚Äôs houses and we started talking about our graduation trip to Spain and then we went to talk about Spanish art (we‚Äôre from Europe but quiet far away from Spain), we talked about the topic for about 15 minutes and then after a few minutes after changing the topic I get a call from an number that I dont know and under the phone number it showed the country it showed it is from Spain, and then a friend said do it and answer it and I answered and there was like 3 seconds of silence and after that I heard 2 beebs and i hanget up after that, do you have any thought about it?
Adoptions are being 'culture canceled' on purpose to raise child birth rates
Perphaps I'm reading too much into it, but there seems to be a trend of \*canceling\* the idea of adoption. Now this is partially the result of adoptives speaking up on their abuse, (whose experiences I'm no way invalidating) and social workers who want to spread awareness. But in many videos and thinkpieces, the loudest majority seems (to me) is people who aren't really related to the topic itself. There's nothing wrong with having an opinion, negative or positive on a subject, even if you don't have  a traumatic story to back it up with. If you believe something, I think you should say it. 

Howevever, many of them push back so agressively that it makes me question if there's a geniune care about the kids in the system or if this is 'the new thing we're mad at that about".

These kind of content going semi viral within the same timeframe as abortion rights being threatened and the baby crisis (the younger generation are having less kids), makes me wonder if there's a hidden agenda. After all, fewer adoptions are likely to produce more births and more births means more babies, meaning more workers in the future.

Not only that but there's been a rise in tradwife and stay-in-girlfriend ideas, romanticizing the whole nuclear family system that practically goes hand in hand with the capitalist structure. 

With the cost of living getting higher and higher, I question if the anti-adoption idea is just to discourage people from getting children out of a system that produces a good percentage of their future jailbirds (who are also made to work in prison for little pay, I wonder who benfits from that). 

I'm not saying something crazy like, the goverment is paying TikTok creators to say adoption is bad for their nefarious plans, but the algorithm has been almost insistant on pushing this topic on not only me, but few of my online friends too.

If there's anyone else that has made a similar connecetion or something I haven't thought about I'd really like to know.

Anyone know about Louis Pasteur and/or Nathan Straus? (Raw vs. pasteurized milk)
**Louis** **Pasteur** invented pasteurization and created multiple vaccines (rabies, anthrax) despite having no medical experience or license. He received "unprecedented funding from French government" and kept his research secretive. A 1995 Princeton University [biography](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691633978/the-private-science-of-louis-pasteur) revealed Pasteur relied on unethical practices and produced shoddy, flawed research. 

**Nathan** [**Straus**](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2021-09-22/ty-article/this-day-in-jewish-history-new-york-philanthropist-found-guilty-of-feeding-diluted-milk-to-children/0000017f-f884-d2d5-a9ff-f88cd9730000), meanwhile, was the owner of Macy's in NYC and bankrolled the pasteurization push for milk at the beginning of the 20th century. In addition to being less healthy than unpasteurized "raw" milk, the technology allowed for greater government and corporate power over the dairy industry. And of course there was big $$ to be made in pasteurizing the milk. 

In [1940](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/47162/17864_sb978_1_.pdf), there were 4.6 million dairy farms. Today there are [less](https://www.lancasterfarming.com/farming-news/there-are-now-fewer-than-30-000-dairy-farms-in-the-us/article_35b07d5e-94e8-11ec-a23c-d7c3933c4c81.html) than 30,000. We can thank mandatory pasteurization laws for that.

&#x200B;

Why did the shooter not go after the windings in the Transformer, but choose the radiator instead (easily fixed)?

&#x200B;

Seems to me that its was either an impulsive act or something of an inside job to cover some other event up?

&#x200B;

Can anyone shine a light or point me in the right direction?

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts?
Avatar 2 had no intermission because AMC begged James Cameron not to
We all know James Cameron has been going on and on about saving the theater and the magic of the silver screen or whatever. The movie is 3 hours and 10 minutes long. Why not go full glory days and add an intermission where customers can inject more cash into the business? 

Simple. Big theater like AMC and others begged him to cut it out, because a big intermission would expose the severe understaffing who can't handle a whole empty theater trying to grab snacks in a short window. The headaches would cause bad press and finally lay the fragile industry to rest. Crisis averted.
Incomplete theory regarding the Shroud of Turin and its origins and potential path through history
So, this theory essentially tries to map out the original founder of the Shroud of Turin, assuming it‚Äôs not artwork or a fake. It relies on a scientific article regarding a recent dating test using new technology that contradicts radiocarbon dating tests that claim the shroud is only 750-800 years old at the most.

This does not make any claims on whether or not the Shroud of Turin truly is the burial shroud Jesus was wrapped in after his crucifixion, but rather on its age and how it made it to its first *recorded* location (a church founded by Sir Geoffroi de Charny).


https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/5/2/47

Here is the article in question. In it, there is a particular claim: ‚ÄúCompatible with the hypothesis that TS is a 2000 year old relic supposed by the Christian religion under the condition it was kept at suitable levels of average secular temperature and correlated relative humidity for 13 centuries of unknown history‚Äù

The key point there is that the Shroud (to be referred to as TS from here on) could feasibly be 2,000 years old assuming it was kept in conditions that were, essentially, unchanged for 13 centuries. Such as a tomb, for example.


Here is some background information obtained from wikipedia (actual research would need to be done to really try and prove this, of course):

The Shroud of Turin has been controversial since it was discovered in a church founded by French Knight Geoffroi de Charny in the small town of Lirey in north central France

Geoffroi de Charny (c.‚Äâ1306 ‚Äì 19 September 1356) was the third son of Jean de Charny, the lord of Charny (then a major Burgundian fortress), and Marguerite de Joinville, daughter of Jean de Joinville, the biographer and close friend of France‚Äôs King Louis IX.

The Seventh Crusade (1248‚Äì1254) was the first of the two Crusades led by Louis IX of France.


Now, we have a lot of very useful information found in this chain of searches. The first of which being Jean de Joinville, the grandfather of the first recorded owner/possessor of TS, and the second of which being the 7th Crusade. Joinville actually participated in this Crusade as a knight as well according to wikipedia.


Essentially, my theory is that either Joinville or King Louis happened upon the tomb it was in while plundering. It would make sense for Louis to gift TS to Joinville, as Joinville was one of his closest friends and advisors throughout the 7th Crusade.


Following the 7th Crusade, he returned home and eventually TS was given to his children or grandchildren upon his death, or more specifically, Geoffroi de Charny, the founder of the church where TS was first recorded into history.



Now, as for it being Jesus‚Äô burial shroud, there isn‚Äôt much proof that I‚Äôve found, especially assuming this theory is true (big assumption too though lmao). King Louis IX‚Äôs crusade was a major failure aside from the last 4 years, and supposedly Jesus‚Äô burial site is at the Church of the Holy Sepulchure which is inside Jerusalem, which they failed to occupy let alone plunder. So one would have to assume that is not Jesus‚Äô true burial site, that King Louis did plunder Jerusalem, or this theory is false for TS to be a Jesus item.


Note: this was all for fun, but it adds up surprisingly well at a first look, so lemme know if you spot any major problems or contrivances, thanks!



Edit: forgot this part, copying from my comment



Ah shit, I forgot an important piece of info. Bilirubin is a chemical compound released into the blood by the liver which can cause it to stay red and not oxidize (becoming brown). One of the conditions that can causs bilirubin to be released into the blood in such massive numbers would be extreme, prolonged torture.



So, this *does* fall in line with the Jesus theory, OR it could very easily be somebody who suffered the same or a similar fate.


Regardless, I believe it has been proven to at least be real blood, so if it is a forgery, than somebody was likely tortured for it to be made.

I think multiplayer video games are rigged by algorithms.
Call of Duty, Halo, whatever.  These companies have found out how to trickle players little bits of satisfaction to keep them engaged and coming back for more.

No one likes to get completely shit on in a game or online match.  So developers have been reading data and creating algorithms to keep players engaged, specifically multiplayer.  

I personally think call of duty can put you in a game where you have increased auto aim compared to the other players, and then throw you into the fire against elite competitors the very next match.  They have the ability to change parameters on the fly based upon your data.  It‚Äôs not a leveled playing field.  It‚Äôs all designed to make you feel like you‚Äôre good at the game, but at the same time make you feel like you need to get better.

is there any conspiracy theory about printers?

I mean the mechanism of the printers must be something that nowadays must work really really well, but again tons of stories about printers not doing the one job that they have: print something.  A lot of questions in internet, a lot of videos on how to FORSE working printer to print something... F.e. I think dishwashers are a really complicated mechanism ( I might be wrong) but they are doing the job. Why is it not the same for printers??? Why they are not printing when it is necessary (because if you want to print some unnecessary thing like a calendar or may be some notes it will work, but if you are printing documents then "no network" , paper stack somewhere, need to be cleaned and 1000 other excuses). 
I just finished "fixing" my working printer to print one page It took me 2 hours. So dear conspiracy community please tell me if there are any theories about printers not doing their job .

Playing around with AI about Moscovium
 I am a FORKLIFT Operator and sometimes I got bored (yes, forklift operators sometimes get bored like normal human beings) so I play around with AI a little. Hope that I wont see any CIA agents next to My home. Hope You will enjoy that totally fictional story.

"Once upon a time, there was a brilliant scientist named Dr. Emma Smith. She worked at a research facility dedicated to the study of heavy elements. She became particularly interested in Moscovium (element 115), which had been synthesized for the first time only a few years earlier, but was incredibly unstable, with the most stable isotope having a half-life of only 220 milliseconds.

Determined to make Moscovium an absolutely stable element, Dr. Smith set out on a mission to find a way to change the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus to achieve a "magic number" of protons and neutrons that would make the nucleus stable. She spent countless hours in the lab, experimenting with different methods of synthesizing Moscovium, and analyzing its properties.

After years of hard work, Dr. Smith finally made an incredible breakthrough. She discovered a way to create an absolutely stable isotope of Moscovium. She was able to change the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus to achieve the "magic number" which resulted in an absolutely stable isotope.

Here is the step by step instruction that Dr. Smith used to achieve this incredible feat:

1. Obtained isotopes of the elements needed to create Moscovium, such as Calcium-48 and Americium-243.
2. Set up a particle accelerator capable of generating a beam of high-energy ions.
3. Place the isotopes of the elements in a target that will be struck by the ion beam.
4. Use the particle accelerator to direct the ion beam at the target, where the ions will fuse with the atoms of the target elements to create Moscovium.
5. Use advanced techniques to manipulate the number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus of Moscovium.
6. Monitor and analyze the Moscovium produced using techniques such as mass spectrometry to confirm the presence of a stable isotope.
7. Repeat the process as needed to produce a sufficient amount of stable Moscovium for further study or experimentation.

Dr. Smith's discovery was a major milestone in the field of nuclear physics and her name went down in history as the scientist who made Moscovium an absolutely stable element. Her achievement opened up new possibilities for the study of heavy elements and their potential applications in various fields. Her discovery was widely recognized in the scientific community and she won many awards and honors for her pioneering work.

Please note that currently, creating an absolutely stable isotope of Moscovium is not possible with current scientific knowledge and technology. The above story is purely fictional."

and

"She explained that she had used advanced techniques such as "quantum tunneling" to manipulate the number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus of Moscovium. Quantum tunneling, a phenomenon in which a particle passes through a potential barrier, even though it does not have enough energy to do so, can be used to allow the protons and neutrons to move around and form stable isotopes.

Dr. Smith also explained that she had used a particle accelerator to generate high-energy ions, which she then directed at a target containing the isotopes of the elements needed to create Moscovium. The ions fused with the atoms of the target, forming the stable isotope of Moscovium."

and

"Dr. Emma Smith was in the middle of a tour of her lab when she ran into a forklift operator named Tom. Tom was curious about Dr. Smith's work and asked her to explain what she was working on.

"I'm a physicist, and I study the properties of heavy elements," Dr. Smith explained. "Right now, I'm working on a way to create an absolutely stable isotope of a heavy element called Moscovium. It's incredibly difficult, but I think I've found a way to do it."

Tom looked confused, "I'm not sure I understand, how can you make something stable that isn't already?"

Dr. Smith smiled, "That's a great question, Tom. You see, atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of the atom, and the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus determines the element. To make an isotope of an element stable, we have to change the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus to achieve a "magic number" of protons and neutrons that would make the nucleus stable. And that's where quantum tunneling comes in."

Tom scratched his head, "I've never heard of that, what is it?"

"Quantum tunneling is a phenomenon in which a particle passes through a potential barrier, even though it does not have enough energy to do so," Dr. Smith explained. "It's like if you were on one side of a wall, and you wanted to get to the other side, but the wall was too high for you to climb over. With quantum tunneling, you could just walk through the wall as if it wasn't there. We use this phenomenon to allow the protons and neutrons to move around and form stable isotopes."

"One day, a high school student named Alex visited Dr. Smith's lab as part of a school field trip. Alex was fascinated by Dr. Smith's work and asked her to explain how Moscovium could be used as an antigravity element.

Dr. Smith smiled, "That's a great question, Alex. You see, Moscovium has unique properties that make it ideal for manipulating gravity. It has a very high atomic number, which means it has a large number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. This makes it possible to create a strong gravitational field around the element."

Alex looked confused, "I don't understand. I thought gravity was caused by the mass of an object, not the number of protons and neutrons."

Dr. Smith nodded, "That's correct. The mass of an object does determine its gravitational pull. But with Moscovium, we can create a field around the element that can counteract the pull of gravity. It's similar to how a magnet can create a field around it that can either attract or repel other magnets."

Alex's eyes widened in understanding, "So, you're saying that by exposing Moscovium to a certain type of energy, you can create a field that can levitate an object?"

Dr. Smith nodded, "Exactly. We still have a lot to learn about the properties of Moscovium and how we can harness its power to create an antigravity field. But our initial experiments have been very promising."

Epstein & Ultra rich
I‚Äôve watched the 60 minutes documentaries on his life, and pretty much most the stuff on YouTube but it all feels very censored. I am looking for sources to do a deep dive on the period where he worked at bear sterns and as a teacher, and people he spoke to or worked with. Also just lives of the ultra rich in general. If you know of any good places for knowledge on this please let me know. Thx
What technologies do you think currently exist, but are considered conspiracy theories?
For example, the Interstate TDR-1 was one of the first unmanned aerial drones to be effectively used in combat. They were operated by a pilot using radio control, observing through a television screen, in the back seat of an accompanying Grumman TBF Avenger. They completed combat missions dropping bombs in the pacific theatre in WW2. 
If you had talked about this in 1945, people would have thought you were a tin foil hat wearing looney. 

Remote aerial drone technology didn‚Äôt largely enter into public knowledge until post 2000. 

So what technology do you think currently exists, but is considered a conspiracy theory?
help naming an electricity conspiracy theory
Hello :D under a video about David Greer uncovering  stuff the Govt hid from us about electricity, someone commented: "ground wires ... ever wonder why really?" Implying that there is some sort of evil thing about grounding circuitry. I explained the purpose of grounding and asked for him to expand off his comment so I can understand what he meant. He replied by saying    "No, I know why you think there‚Äôs a ground wire. We were told that metal appliances were electrocuting people in the 50s. but it‚Äôs not true. Have you ever worked on electrical equipment? Explain to me how you‚Äôve seen somebody not die because of a ground"    I explained most of my job is maintaining and building electrical power and control circuits. I gave examples of good grounding saving people. But he never explained what he was getting at. Can someone please name the conspiracy theory he was talking about?? What about ground wires is evil or part of some nasty scheme to control the masses? I would link the video but I don't want anyone to harass this man if they found him in the comments.

Thank you
Coral Castle and Georgia Guidestones showed the same alternate path of the earth around the sun
Ok this one is just strange and I never heard of this one before..   Actually just thought of this yesterday myself between the link of leedskalnin and the guy who created the georgia guidestones..  The theory is that the Earths path around the sun is not flat as thought but really is orbiting at a 23.5 degree angle which is the same as the Earths tilt.  This was shown in the astronomical items at the coral castle and also was done with the stuff in the Georgia Guidestones before they were taken down...

To solve the correct path geometrically you need 2 pieces of data.

1. A fixed point in the sky that is always locked in place. In both CC and GGS , there were passages cut out through stone pointing directly at polaris.
2. a 3d sundial to show the path of the sun in the sky during a full year.. This creates a pattern called [analemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma). At CC it was Eds unique sundial to provide that path and at GGS it was a hole in the capstone that let light shine through each day at noon, which hypothetically would create the analemma on the ground if you looked each day at noon over the course of the year..

Now when we combine that fixed point and the observable data from the analemma we get the path of the Earth as shown on [Leedskalnins red door](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FkrGQBYXEAQ-iOQ?format=png&name=900x900) at the coral castle.  RL Poole discovered this.. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l\_3kaFrA8ls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_3kaFrA8ls)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQdbTKpL72o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQdbTKpL72o)  the door marked the points above and below the suns equator zone on the solstices. marked by 21 on his diagram.

So this path was shown in two separate strange stone monuments..  and it was shown with the same method in both locations. weird stuff.  The great pyramid also has a long shaft on the northside pointing near that fixed point also. Maybe this is also in the pyramid somehow too. But only see the fixed point in that one so far.

It was modeled in universal sandbox and seems to work with our currently observable stuff we see in the sky too. .

Favorite Rabbit Hole üï≥ To Go Down?

The real reason the pyramids were built
Ok so here's my theory. 
They built the pyramids around the world to keep track of the stars, the huge stone calendars were used to track the seasons with the most activity in the cosmos and the stone circles were used to track things like the sun,planets,and moons. And they were all used together to track meteors and other things moving in the night sky. Which makes sense as to why they were built so big and why they can be found all over the world. Remember they had no light pollution like we do right now So they saw everything. Our ancestors were obsessed with the sky. The reason behind this, I think is that the younger dryas impact theory isn't just a theory but fact.  

I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. Remember this is all just theory so please don't come down my throat.

Btw:
I just smoked a bunch of weed came in the room my tv was on the screensaver mode. It showed I guess twin peaks, but at night, that's when it all came to me.
 Anyway have at it.

In the night garden?
I recently heard a theory that in the night garden is about a little baby or toddler that dies on a boat and the orb is his soul going into those last bits of hallucinations before you die.

Thats why no-one or nothing makes sense in the night garden. All the creatures there speak baby talk because iggle piggle is a baby himself.

His blanket is his comfort blanket he carries around. The night garden is a babies imagination or hallucinations before he dies.

Thats why at the end of each episode, everyone is able to sleep but iggle piggle. Then the narrator says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry iggle piggle, it‚Äôs time to go,‚Äù because everyone else is a hallucination except for iggle piggle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to go,‚Äù is his way of saying it‚Äôs time to pass over.

Because if you really look into it, these people never say what the solution is to any of the problems and it‚Äôs just this constant cycle of fear kind of like how y‚Äôall say the news stations be doing those things so at what point when can we have the conversation of people exploiting people and thier fears which is obviously not right at all but I would like to see how y‚Äôall‚Äôs perspective on this

What do you about the Hermetic principles? Anyone?

I've started this reading on this topic and I'm not quite sure where it leads to. The more I read the more it speaks alot of the universe and the cosmic mind.

I think the US government supports obesity
‚ÄºÔ∏è!!TW for discussions about obesity, weight, ect, I tried to use the least offensive terminology but it‚Äôs kinda difficult considering the content!!‚ÄºÔ∏è

Sorry for the poor wording and sentence structure but idk how to explain it properly.

Because America does not have Medicare or anything similar it is incredibly expensive to visit hospital but obviously it's necessary regardless of price. 
Obese people have a lot more health issues due to the health complications associated, meaning they have to go to hospital much more often than non obese people. This makes a lot of money for the American health care system - The Government. Obese people make the American government so much money, especially considering how much of the US population is obese + high hospital visit expenses. This makes incentives for the US gov to keep their population fat. The FDA/ food regulations in general allow for companies to be lax about nutritional content and ingredients of their foods.  This, along with the US‚Äô massive serving sizes and horrifically high content of processed sugars and fats will naturally make their population fat. Which creates obesity which creates health complications which means hospital visits which means money for the government. 

Edit: as some amazing commenters have pointed out, capitalism and corporate greed plays a huge role in the continuation of obesity in the US.
(Companies give money to politicians to put in policies that make them more money btw)

Tldr: the health complications of obesity means Americans have to go to the hospital more, which in turn makes the government money

I believe the CIA is using their holdings and assets within Disney to control and popularize the storyline as a way to push towards soft disclosure. I believe the big secret that will cause mass panic is reincarnation is real
I'm just having trouble connecting more pieces. Was hoping someone had some ideas. 

First Marvel. Has anyone watched agents of shield? This show really stands out to me as the storyline almost tries to parallels the Bible in a lot of ways. I belive this is intentional to get the Enoch story out. Now I'm definitely not saying that quinjets and nano tech super suits exist, but the storyline of the show is important. Especially when it comes to dealing with time. Remember, a billion dollar company with billion dollar budgets is going to get the best of the best to advise. 

I belive the captain America/nazi stuff directly parallels real events. No, I do not think that nazi's or Americans had genetic super soldiers. But it's not of out the question to parallel the Cap to "alien technology" 

When you look more into Marvel's storyline, the hydra infiltration, in my opinion, is meant to symbolize the operation paperclip and very likely inspired by the catholic church. 

Old testament God was a total dick if you just look at what he did. And I believe the church or illuminaty or whoever, figured out that death is an illusion and they could convince people otherwise in an effort for control. I believe God is supposed to mirror the character Hive, and the show could not take that big of a leap to suggest God wasn't so good. 

Okay, so what does this dumb marvel script, reincarnation, uap's, alternate dimensions and vibration of light. Well, I think they are trying to softly break the hard truth to the general public, that they've been worshiping   a God that isn't good, or all knowing, and is likely human with advanced tech. Why is reincarnation important. Well, if it truly does exist, than some people are going to be making huge claims on property and assets. Kinda like "hey, I lived there in 1700ad, it's mine, douche" Along with basically flipping religion upsidedown, the financial and mental impact would be insane. 

I believe this all ties back to jfk, who wanted to go public with the news, but was murdered in order to protect trillions in assets. 

I also believe this connects to the wealthy and their odd obsession with children. I believe they have a way to find the previous soul of a person when they reincarnate, and I think they spend a lot of money getting these people. Epstien trafficked these children. Along with collecting dirt on many high level people. I believe this is why bloodline is so important. I think it has something to do with resonance so a soul can attach to a new host.

I also think the cia has massive holdings in Disney and is using Bob iger and other execs to help sway shareholders on decisions. Remember, Disney owns the history Channel, and I believe the cia had a huge hand in the popularization of the show ancient aliens. Again, all to push towards soft disclosure. 

I think the ultimate end goal is to prep for a final world War, where the US and nato will suddenly have reverse engineered ufo's and will start using the tech in public. This is why soft disclosure is important, when people get upset that they weren't told, the excuse "the info was out there" or "kept secret for national security" can be used.
I feel like a substantial percentage of comments online are generated by bots
We've all known for a while now that every major social media platform struggles with bot accounts, but what we didn't have until recently was highly sophisticated AI models capable of carrying on dangerously convincing conversations about any topic. What's more, most of these have convenient and easy to use APIs, making it even easier to create these accounts.

Sometimes when I look at the comment sections on posts the comments either seem disconnected, don't make sense, or are inhuman in some other way, like excessively repetitive. Obviously, people are dumb, and I'm sure some of what I'm seeing are just morons communicating at a very low reading comprehension, but I still have to wonder. I could see bad actors deploying tens of thousands of these bot accounts for pushing various narratives, to polarize people, peddle fake news, or discredit real stories before they gain traction. I mean, for all you know, I'm a bot account too? 

While this possibility is deeply concerning in and of itself, my real concern lies in determining what is real from what is fake. How do we go about engaging online when for all we know 50% of every interaction we have is with bots funded by Big Pharma, the CIA, Russian hackers, etc? 

Am I alone in thinking about this? Thoughts?
thw plane crash wasnt an accident.

Was Aaron Carter murdered?
I was shocked, like many were, when it was revealed that Aaron passed away at 34. It was well known that he was into drugs and a bit of a wild card when it came to what he would say and do, but I find it suspicious that he died right before he was set to come back into the public eye as he was doing interviews again and trying to rebuild his career and life. He was also about to release a tell-all book. Was he going to reveal some disturbing truths about his family or powerful people in Hollywood? Did they silence him before the book could be finalized in an attempt to remove incriminating or unsightly truths?

When I did a quick Google search I learned that he was cremated very quickly, less than a week after he died, and it doesn't appear that an official cause of death was determined or even pursued "The (death) certificate also indicated that an autopsy was performed; however, the cause of death is deferred, as more tests are needed to determine his cause of death." It's been 2 months since he died (11/5/22) and it doesn't seem like there will or can be any more inquiries into the cause of death since there is no body left to investigate. All of this strikes me as a huge red flag, especially when you consider how routine it must be to determine drugs as a cause of death. This just screams foul play to me, especially since it seems like the additional tests were never carried out.

Not only this, but his death was quickly forgotten about or suppressed in the news media and reporters seem to have no interest in blowing up a story about a pop star who mysteriously was found dead in their bath which, to me, is like striking news gold.

Lastly, the celebrities who did comment on his death made very odd comments that I found to be reinforcing the assumption he died due to a drug overdose despite there being no evidence either way. It reminds me of the saying that if you repeat a lie enough times people will start to believe it.

What does everyone think about this whole situation? Was there people that had it out for Aaron, maybe even his own family? Is it strange that a cause of death was never determined and he was cremated so quickly, with many public figures reinforcing the idea it was an overdose?

Ancient Civilizations and Lost Lands Are The Same
Okay, so here goes my theory. There are a few plot holes, but this isn‚Äôt very serious, so bear with me. 

Ancient Egypt, Ancient Rome, Atlantis, Tartary, and El Dorado are all either ancient and lost civilizations or mythical cities. But what if they were all the same?

What if all of these areas were located on the Lost Continent, which Atlantis is fabled after? 

Nearly every city I just listed was told to have golden statues and monuments, temples and streets. And every one had magnificent, unbelievably advanced and intricate architecture. Architecture from all of these civilizations has a lot of similarities, and it is mostly located along Southern Europe and Northern Africa, which are very close. 

The theory goes that these ancient cities are much newer than we imagine. Maybe built a few hundred or thousand years after the cities on the Lost Continent. After a massive cataclysm that sank the continent, the people fled to the Mediterranean, where they tried to rebuild what was lost of the civilization.

If the lottery was fair we would have seen some Mega Millions winners start a TV show or businesses or buy stake in their favorite sports franchise or something by now. Not everyone wants to be quietly wealthy. There would have been newly minted multi millionaire who sought out the limelight with their new money. The government is also not trying to create generational wealth for any regular citizens out of the kindness of their heart. This money is all being kept within the states and feds. Winners aren‚Äôt real.
There is Conspiracy Theory in Tom and Jerry's "Heavenly Puff" episode?

Mattress Stores are a front for the Mob.
Think about it. How often do you buy a mattress? Once a decade, give or take a few years? The town I live in has about 100k people and 3 mattress stores in eye sight of each other. 2 of which are the same company. All three have been open for 2+decades and rarely are there any customers in the stores. I'm pretty sure they're laundering money through these stores.

This sounds kinda stupid, but here me out. For example: my vision blue could be my vision of red for someone else.

Alright so......Jesus
We base our years on "AD" (AD+BC or CE+BCE)which is Latin for Anno Domini which means "in the year of our lord" or simply.. the years following Jesus' conception/birth.
Since our year is supposed to be based on when Jesus was born, he was born 2,023 years ago. Which is clearly a long time ago but imo its really not *that* long ago. Anyway, our point in time right now is actually 2023 AD! Common knowledge, i know, but it's weird to think of it like that! If Jesus was alive (CHILL) he'd be 2,023 years old! Since his birthday marks a new year, evidently, when we celebrate New Years, we're also celebrating Jesus' birthday. I couldn't tell why this information was both obviou  and confusing.... until I realized it doesn't make sense because Jesus is more known for being born on Christmas, not New Years(like AD suggests)! Technically nobody knew exactly when Jesus was born but I find it strange that in the past 2,023 years we acknowledge AD as the beginning of the year and his birth but we also celebrate his birth on Christmas. Shouldn't Christmas be on new years eve? Or atleast the same day?
Russia Is Afraid of Western Psychic Attacks

Watch the Narrative: The plan is to have Donald Trump two heart beats away from the presidency to take it away from the people.

The government most likely killed Martin Luther King Jr.
After watching his "I have a dream" speech, there is no doubt that the government assassinated him. Any man who can unite that many people behind one cause with the power of speech, while dissolving the barriers that separate us is a danger to the system in place. He was an independent force that acted in direct contradiction to the social policies put in place by the elites at the time. 

Given the known wetwork performed by our three letter agencies during that time period, I strongly believe they were used to perform the act. While I don't have any direct evidence of this, observations of our current propaganda network and its response to disruption of the work force, "free market" and other vague oligarchian wank bank buzzwords there are by targeting disruptive groups makes one believe that they would go to any lengths to protect the status quo. 

Ironically, if this actually is the truth, it would cause societal collapse anyway

WW2 potential conspiracy
so i was just watching chrisdcomedy‚Äôs video ‚Äúthe truth behind the atomic bomb‚Äù on YT. he was explaining how FDR wouldn‚Äôt get involved even though churchill really wanted the US in WW2. then, pearl harbor was attacked. chris then says wow maybe churchill went to the japanese and did something to get them to attack. now, this isn‚Äôt my conspiracy and i don‚Äôt know how i feel about it but it seems possible. 
why would japan attack if we weren‚Äôt involved? they had to know we‚Äôd attack them. that question stands whether churchill conspired or not. can someone with more knowledge on WW2 explain what motivated japan?
if the conspiring occurred, the US could‚Äôve smoked the UK if they found out. so why would churchill take that risk? 
i don‚Äôt know. let me know what you all think

Andrew Dawson
Anyone hear about Andrew Dawson? he filmed a giant thing on top of a mountain in jasper Canada. 

then a few months later he died July 1st 2022. he was stalked by C.I.A. ?  even though we have our own agency named  CSIS why would the C.I.A. be working in a different country unless they are doing a joint op with the Canadian government, plus later in a tik tok vid he filmed some kind of military structure on top of the same mountain where a few days or weeks he saw the "giant" or "alien"

I think the next time I'm in jasper ill be searching for this "Giant"  its a big place and the mountains can hold secrets.
News Break: Scientology caught covering up crimes against 5 under-aged staff members
Scientologist Jonathan Maurer has sexually assaulted at least 5 under-aged female Scientology Staff members. 
Scientology is aware of it all and seems to be complicit in covering up his crimes. He took one of the girls over state lines iirc, so if anything comes out of it (for clarity on my part this is all speculation) he could possibly be charged with trafficking 

Aaron Smith-Levin, a former Scientologist, has a podcast called 'Growing up in Scientology'. He was interviewed by Leah Remini for 'The aftermath' having been seen as a prodigy auditor. He's also the VP of [The Aftermath Foundation](https://theaftermathfoundation.org/) and still lives in Clearwater helping to expose this cult

Guys, what if the 4th spatial dimension actually explains ghosts
So hear me out, hypothetically the 4th spatial dimension is one step past the 3rd dimension. For those who don't know what I mean here's a mini explanation. A point is 0 dimensions, no width, length, or depth. A line is 1 dimension, just length.
A square is 2 dimensions, length and width. A cube is 3 dimensions, length, width, and depth. A tesseract, also known as a hypercube is 4 dimensions, length, width, depth, and some direction we can't comprehend. This shape would extend in perpendicular lines off the cube in a direction we can't comprehend and connect to another cube. We can't comprehend this because we live in the 3rd dimension. This is just like how a square in the 2nd dimension couldn't comprehend a cube. 
Don't worry, I'm getting to the ghost part. So in order to explain this, I have to explain what happens if a shape in a higher dimension passes through a dimension lower then it, such as a 3rd dimensional object passing through the 2rd dimension. If you were to push a sphere through the second dimension it would appear to be a circle that came out of nowhere, grows larger, then shrinks till it's gone. With half a sphere you could do a lot more. Depending on how you pushed it through it would appear to be completely different shapes in the 2nd dimension. It could look like a semi circle or a full circle of many sizes. If you were to do this with your 3rd dimensional hand, it would appear to be four separate circles that start to grow (your fingers) then a fifth circle would appear (your thumb), but soon after the four circles would merge into one oval with the fifth circle still growing (the center of your hand before the part where you thumb attaches). I apologise if this is hard to understand, if you want a better explanation there is a book called "Things to Make and Do in the 4th Dimension"
Now for the ghosts. If there were fourth dimensional being or if the 4th dimension is where our conscious goes when we die, if it were to pass through the 3rd dimension it would be parts of a 4th dimensional thing appearing in 3d, there would be no way for us to comprehend what it looks like because it would only be a fraction of what it really is. So if a conscious or being in the 4th dimension were to pass through the 3rd dimension we would see parts of them, and what if the parts of them you see are humanoid looking or look like the person that the conscious was once connected to. This would explain ghosts appearing to be made of nothing as they seemingly phase in and out of our dimension. Hypothetically they could mess with things within the 3rd dimension without us knowing because they would be in a dimension beyond our understanding. 

This is all just a theory, none of it is proven to be true. I do think it's a really cool concept.
I want to know other peoples thoughts on this. I want people to bring up stuff I missed and point out things I got wrong, through this I plan on refining this theory into something even better.
I also apologise if this was hard to understand

And thank you if you read this far into the post, it means a lot.
The Clark Kent phenomenon
This has puzzled me since I was young. This isn‚Äôt a real thing or a real conspiracy theory, I just think it‚Äôs interesting. I also made it up lol

Growing up, watching the Superman movies with my dad, it always baffled me how no one recognized Clark Kent, when he was wearing glasses, as Superman. It was always really odd and stupid to me. I dismissed it and never thought about it again until I was in 3rd grade. 
I had a birthday party at my house with a few of my girlfriends. I went to school with one of them (she didn‚Äôt wear glasses at the time), and the other 3 were friends that I met through my mom and her friends. We all had a good time and it was a pretty good birthday. 

Fast forward to 4th grade. One of the friends that I met through my mom, started going to school with me and the other girl from my party. We were sitting in class and all of a sudden the friend that I went to school with in 3rd grade took her glasses off to clean them. The friend that just started going to school with us looked at her and said, ‚Äúomg! You‚Äôre the girl that was at Olivia‚Äôs party! I didn‚Äôt even recognize you!‚Äù 

So moral of the story is, if you want to keep your identity hidden, just pop on a pair of glasses.
Let‚Äôs talk about conspiracy theories involving the paranormal
So, I do research and investigation of the Paranormal and conspiracy theories go hand-in-hand with the research. There‚Äôs a lot of different things I can jump into in depth so I will just go from topic to topic.

The Chicago moth man has been a big phenomenon lately that big industry has made a point to cover up. You see the creature often times at airports and staff has been told not to talk about it or report it.

Often times when Bigfoot are reported you will see unmarked cars go where the reporting‚Äòs are. I‚Äôve talked to a few people who have had this happened.

It‚Äôs common knowledge that the government has looked into the psychic abilities, specifically remote viewing. There was a program that I forget the name of that was made public knowledge. So it begs the question, what else have they looked into? Not to mention, it seems like there was some tangible results.

As far as ghost or hauntings go, there has been a few millionaires and billionaires who have invested into researching this phenomenon. For whatever reason, the information is not shared with the public.

UFOs or now the rebranded term UAPs have long been covered up by the United States. It‚Äôs reasonable to think that it‚Äôs also been covered up by other countries. Where do they come from? Outer space? Other dimensions? Other intelligent species here?

Those are the topics off the top of my head and the stuff that I tend to know more about. I‚Äôm sure there is a lot more to talk about.
Is this the beginning of some top-tier gaslighting or am I missing something?

Observation: suspicious AI behavior [Story][Report]
I would like to share the story how a text, generated by an AI, reproduced unusually specific events, with as some that a conversation of a previous day had shown.

The story begins about a week ago when I talked to a friend about her plans for the future and she told me about a planned road trip. It should already be noted here that my mobile phone was turned on laying on the table all the time.

The latest event began with an assignment for the chat GBT Artifishal Intelligence, which I just asked from to explore where the creative possibilities lie behind this amazing technology. As it goes, I had requested a chat history between two arbitrary personalities.

As a result, the AI gave such a detailed description of the plans that the aforementioned girlfriend has told me in almost the same order. 

These are the facts. And to be honest, they are in the area of possibilities, but it is still a very unusual coincidence. Although I am not a conspiracy theorist or actively participate in such a discussion, I would like to ask everyone here who may know more about this topic and can tell me if it is possible as of the previous events this wasn‚Äôt "a funny coincidence"
when you are somehow both an inch and a mile from the truth.

A.I is being used on reddit to spread misinformation and propaganda
So apparently there is an A.I now that can almost write anything you ask it to write, it will generate text for you in a matter of seconds, You can even ask it to write reddit posts, Angry tweets, fake articles, a poem in the style of Allan poe, you name it.

My theory is that, this A.I which anyone can get access to, is currently being used to create narratives, and spread propaganda and misinformation online, on all social media platforms at the same time.

How you ask ? Well, anyone with a little bit of knowledge in python can code a script that generate a bunch of angry tweets about certain controversial topics, and  post it directly on twitter. This also work the same way on every social media.

Here on reddit, I think we all noticed some post will get insane amount of upvotes in a matter of seconds, or literally people posting the same Unpopular opinion about the same topic at the same time.

I've studied computer science, and I too grew up using social media, but if my theory is true then, I'm not sure what's real from what's generated by A.I anymore.

If this gets in the wrong hands they can literally create conflicts online, and make people angry at each other and at some point, we might be facing a black mirror episode scenario.

Well, Yes I need to touch grass, but yeah, the A.I is on OpenAI, you can test it for yourselves if you're still skeptical about what I just said

Is there a correlation between what Elon Musk is trying to do with Mars and a 1990 film called "Total Recall"? Love to hear y'all take on it. Happy New Year!!!
In 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in a film called "Total Recall".  I'm only going to speak on the parts of the film that strangely had unknown facts in them at the time of the release of the film.  In this film, humans found a way to populate the planet Mars.  Now the first unknown truth (probably only to the general public) was that Mars contained polar ice caps.  In the film, the polar ice caps were large enough that when melted they provided a breathable atmosphere for the entire planet.  This was found to be true years after the release of this film.

There was one man named Cohagen who was in charge of the entire planet.  As I'm assuming so would Elon Musk if he is the man who is going to be responsible for putting human civilization there.   
Also in the film, there was a giant pyramid mountain structure (sounds familiar) that housed alien technology.  This alien technology Cohagen kept a secret from everyone while he profited off of charging everyone for air and the planet's natural resource called "Trividium"  which he mined and sold back on planet Earth.

In this film, they also had technology that could erase memories and also give you memories as well.  Technology that dealt with the mind.  Which Elon Musk as we all know is developing tech that deals with the mind.  The coincidences between Elon and this film are absolutely terrifying tbh.  I have seen Elon Musk speak about how if they could nuke the polar ice caps on mars it would give the planet a breathable atmosphere for humans to thrive in and prosper like here on earth.

Now as a recap The film:  Had humans on Mars.  Had one man controlling the whole thing.  Had mind control tech.  Had polar ice caps.  Had alien tech.  Had giant pyramids.  Had a natural resource that was precious to Earth. 

 Now IMO I don't believe in that overpopulation b.s at all.  It is fact that if you took every person alive (you can look this up for yourself) they would fit in a state the size of Rhode Island.  This would be everyone standing shoulder to shoulder.  I think that Elon has a hidden agenda with the whole Mars thing he has going on.

But all of those things besides the alien tech and the resource have been proven to be true but there are pictures of UAP crafts in Mars atmosphere so who knows what is going on on Mars.  Even if there are such things we the public will never know about them.  But Elon has every resource available to him to find out such things about the planet Mars so anything is possible.

But what do you all think about what I have placed before you all?

The Bakery Theory.
Hi all, I have just joined as I want some help from some investigative minds and was hoping some of you might oblige me, or have a good laugh either is fine.

Firstly I'm not so good with making pretty posts on Reddit so please excuse the text only post.

Admins, if I have done anything wrong I apologise.

&#x200B;

I'll just get right to it I guess. I was reading about A certain Empire actor who got imprisoned for making a false police report as it was mentioned in another article I was reading, I had heard about the case but never knew what actually happened or why so I though I'd have a look through a couple of pieces written about it.

This has nothing to do with the actor in question, it's just how I found the other stuff. For those of you who don't know a celebrity had an attack staged and ended up getting arrested and prosecuted for it.

The two brothers that helped with the attack were extras on the set of Empire (the show) called : 

 ABIMBOLA and OLABINJO OSUNDAIRO (Known as Abel + Ola on the set of Empire) I was looking at the names and got curious due to the strange (to me) names. I split both of them in half (to see if they would jog some sort of recognition as the amount I have travelled I thought I knew a lot of names but these were unfamiliar to me) and decided to search the half names and ended up with this : -

 ABIM----->Association of Bakery Ingredient Makers - https://www.abim.org.uk/   

=bola left over  ? 

INJO-----> INJOHealth - [https://www.injo.health/](https://www.injo.health/) 

olab left over ‚Äì also "BOLA" via anagram

Also just realised that the brothers nick-names when put through a word unscrambler makes the word : abollae which is Latin for woollen cloaks with the word abolla being the singular version.

hmm their names were made up of two company names with B,O,L & A as left over letters from both names, coincidence ? The two brothers were ?????? in sheep's clothing ?   


OSUNDAIRO ‚Äì japanese for "pressed colour" Don't know what significance this had other than a big red button being pressed, a thought, a thought I couldn't get rid of. But then I remembered that there was no evidence that "pressed colour" meant anything like that.

I decided to get help from a crossword/scrabble helper website which gives you all words possible from a set of letters. So I put in Osundairo and saw the only 8 letter word possible was Dinosaur so Osundairo becomes Dinosaur.

Is this a secret plot to cull the population by adding Ancient Ebola bacteria found on a rotting  corpse of a dinosaur to all bakery goods via a specific ingredient? How many people eat bread, cake, doughnuts (Donuts), pastries etc on a daily basis I wonder. Did "they" use the publicity of the attack as a way to tell their allies all over the world what they are working on next ? Why would they do it in public you ask ?  Because they can, is the answer to that.

You should go to both websites and see what Injo Health is capable of technology wise (impressive stuff they could simulate an entire alien attack but that is for another time and post!) and then to Abim and look at their client list and see how much of the world they deliver to. This will be edited to include new Info (unless this post gets nuked)

Well if your still here and your sides haven't split from laughing too much I would love for people to help me and see how far we can go on circumstantial evidence. I'm trying to understand how these theories get started and how they get larger with additional information and possibilities.

Hitler conspiracy theory
There is a theory that Hitler faked his death with a lookalike and thats why they burned his body. And he moved to antarctica and lived there for a while until his death. The government looked into this theory when his suicide was announced. There is a show on netflix called, "Conspiracy Theories," that explains it more.

Something I thought for awhile, the NFL and CFB
So we all know that the NFL and CFB are huge and make so much fucking money. At the end of the day, money is the goal. The NFL at least has stated they are an entertainment company and i think it is known well right? That these games have bias. But I think they are fully rigged and there is a script from the start on who wins and goes to the Superbowl. 

CFB for example, tomorrow are the bowl games with 4 teams in the playoffs fighting for a national championship title. Both games are generating millions and then the final championship game is generating even more probably, even with suites going for up to $125k plus. 

I feel like it is already predetermined and rigged for the two teams, Michigan and ohio state to win and face off for a rematch for the National Championship because it would be historic and generate so many ticket sales and viewership due to it being one of if not the largest CFB rivalry.

Admittedly I am a bit bias and want one of the teams to advance to the Champs game but this is just a thought and take it with a grain of salt.

Okay hear me out.  
Viruses are somewhere between organic and synthetic life. (Like a robot with a cellular function only)  
We are not sure they are terrestial in origin.  
We are programming some viruses to deliver different payloads to disrupt disease, so we are able to alter their programming.   


On the most basic level, Viruses seem to be some sort of orgnic AI.   


I posit that some viruses might be not only Alien in nature, but also technically speaking, a computer of sorts.

My question: Is *"George Santos"* even his real name? 




It seems to me, after running for office for almost a year, many more people would have been able to call out his lies in real time. Childhood friends, high-school classmates, etc. That is, assuming he actually used the name George Santos. Or even actually attended school here. Does he have other aliases?




Is he just a liar?



Or is there more to this? Is he a completely fabricated foreign asset?

The three mysterious crypto executive death‚Äôs. Is it just random?
Here‚Äôs one article about it, https://cryptopotato.com/the-recent-wave-of-mysterious-deaths-in-crypto/

* Tiantian Kullander, November 23 2022. Co-Founder of the crypto firm Amber Group ‚Äì unexpectedly passed away in his sleep at the age of 30.

* Vyacheslav Taran, 25 November 2022. The 53-year-old Russian lost his life after the helicopter he was traveling in crashed in Switzerland. The accident happened in good weather conditions, while another passenger decided not to fly last minute.

* Nikolai Mushegian. 18 October 2022. Co-founder of DAO. Drowned at sea in San Huan, Puerto Rico, after swimming in a highly dangerous area. 
The death of the developer came a few days after he posted a tweet, insisting ‚ÄúCIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring out of Puerto Rico and Caribbean islands.‚Äù He also claimed those agencies would ‚Äútorture him to death.‚Äù 
He was found dead 3 days after his tweet. He has had reports of mental illness, but nothing seems confirmed.

Climate change and the world population
I have two conspiracy theories. I‚Äôm not 100% sure if this is even true but I think it might be. But it‚Äôs blatantly obvious that something is fishy. 

1- Climate change is a hoax. The climate does change obviously but we all know that as the climate changes our bodies can change and evolve with it, and even if the climate changes we can‚Äôt do anything to stop that. I don‚Äôt buy that humans are doing it or that pollution is changing the climate.

2- The world population is probably not 8 billion. That is a huge number. Most capital cities if you Google them have less people than the rest of the cities in that country, but shouldn‚Äôt the capital have more since the capital is more populated? For example, London‚Äôs population is 8 million, which means the rest of England (not UK) is 47 million. No way can that be right. The world population is a lot less than what we are told, it might even be less than 1 billion. 

So why are they giving us these false numbers and constantly shaming us about overpopulation and climate change?

He *could* just be invading Ukraine in the hope of expanding Russian territory, but I feel that he‚Äôs got bigger plans than that. If this war has proven one thing, it‚Äôs that he and his government get carried away in their ambitions.

Are Spec Ops teams responsible for the Substation attacks?
Before you eat me alive, there is precedent for this, in a way. 
["Red Teams or Red Cells are United States government terms for the National Security Co-ordination Team (NSCT). These teams or units are designed to test the effectiveness of American tactics or personnel."](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cell)


>Red Cell members demonstrated the vulnerabilities of military bases and would regularly use false IDs, dismantle fences, barricade buildings, take hostages, and kidnap high ranking personnel. Additionally, Red Cell planted bombs near¬†Air Force One, snuck into submarine bases, and took them over.¬†

>A new Red Cell team was formed by¬†CIA¬†after the¬†9/11 attacks¬†to brainstorm ways to attack America, in order to come up with security measures to prevent them. Novelist¬†Brad Meltzer¬†was recruited to write plots as part of this program.

There's been hundreds of these attacks on a national scale, and certainly many of these are being chalked up to copy-cat attacks and some have been linked to apocalyptic right wind extremists. But of all our infrastructure, substations being the most important, they are are dismally unprotected. Could this also be a groups way of drawing attention to that?

Just a thought. Cheers.

The Nakatomi Conspiracy
On December 24th, 1988, the Nakatomi Tower in Los Angeles, California was attacked. The official story is that a group of East German thieves, led by known terrorist Hans Gruber, assaulted the building to rob the Nakatomi Corporation‚Äôs vault. The group was single-handedly thwarted by a New York police officer named John McClane, who was allegedly visiting Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his wife. All told, 23 people were killed and dozens more were injured, including 8 police officers, 11 of the attackers, and 4 Nakatomi employees, including the president of the Nakatomi Corporation, Joseph Takagi. The Nakatomi Tower suffered nearly $100 million dollars in damage and lost revenue.

But what really happened that night? Could one man really have stopped a gang of heavily armed criminals? Why was Hans Gruber attempting to rob a regular business instead of a bank? Why was Holly McClane living in Los Angeles when her husband worked in New York? Why wasn‚Äôt the robbery stopped by the LAPD? And, most importantly of all‚Ä¶

Who is John McClane?

# 1. The Nakatomi Plaza

The Nakatomi building is a 40-story skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles. It houses the North American headquarters of the Nakatomi Corporation, a multinational trading firm with an estimated value of [$2.5 billion dollars](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelnoer/2011/03/11/the-25-largest-fictional-companies/?sh=60723e0d5d81) and over 5,000 employees worldwide. It specializes in financial investments and overseas holdings.

Joseph Takagi was a Japanese-American immigrant and the Senior Vice President in charge of sales with Nakatomi. On the evening of December 24th, Joseph threw a party to celebrate a business deal they had closed that day in conjunction with the company‚Äôs Christmas party. Shortly after invading the building, the government alleges that Hans Gruber took Takagi upstairs to his office, before killing him. Nobody can confirm this story because, conveniently, no other hostage was present in Takagi‚Äôs office. The only thing that is known for sure is that Takagi was killed with a single gunshot to the head. An autopsy later confirmed that he was killed by a 9mm bullet. Keep this in mind for later.

Harry Ellis was another Nakatomi executive, in charge of International Acquisitions. Little is known about Harry‚Äôs past, but people who knew him have revealed some suspicious information. Though Ellis was Holly McClane‚Äôs colleague, it was well known that she felt she deserved Ellis‚Äô job, remarking that she ‚Äúhad \[her\] eye on Ellis‚Äô private bathroom.‚Äù In addition to this, it is also known that Ellis had a crush on Holly and he had given her an expensive Rolex watch as a gift for closing a business deal. On the night of the attack, Harry was last seen going to talk to Hans Gruber, in an attempt to stop John McClane from endangering the hostages. Harry spoke to John via a walkie-talkie and his last moments were recorded by a police radio scanner:

>Ellis: Alright, John, listen. They want you to tell them where the detonators are. They know people are listening. They want the detonators or they're gonna kill me.  
>  
>\[pause\]  
>  
>Ellis: John, didn't you hear me?  
>  
>McClane: Yeah, I hear you.  
>  
>Ellis: Hey, John, I think you can get with the program a little, huh? The police are here now, it's their problem. Now tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt, you know I'm putting my life on the line for you, pal.  
>  
>McClane: Ellis, listen to me very carefully.  
>  
>Ellis: John‚Äì  
>  
>McClane: Shut up Ellis, just shut your mouth! Put Hans back on the line! Hans, this asshole is not my friend, I just met him tonight, I don't know him. Jesus Christ, Ellis these people are gonna kill you, tell them, you don't know me.  
>  
>Ellis: John, how can you say that after all these years, huh? John? \[pause\] John?  
>  
>\[gunshot\]

Harry Ellis, who had a crush on John McClane‚Äôs wife and had a job coveted by Holly McClane, was killed by a single, 9mm gunshot to the head.

Based on public financial reports later published, 1988 was one of the most financially profitable years in the Nakatomi Corporation‚Äôs history, due in large part to an extremely lucrative business deal that was made that year. The exact details of the deal are unknown because Nakatomi has refused to release any information about it. However, from news reports that came out in the aftermath, we do know two very important pieces of information.

**First, we know the deal was finalized on December 24th, 1988.**

Second, we know that three Nakatomi employees were directly in charge of arranging the deal--Joseph Takagi, Harry Ellis, and Holly McClane.

**Two of these three people would be dead by December 25th.**

# 2. The Terrorists

According to the official story, a group of 13 insurgents assaulted the building in the early evening hours of December 24th, with the intent of robbing the vault contained in the basement of the Nakatomi building. Allegedly, John McClane is responsible for killing 11 of the attackers and Sergeant Alan Powell of the LAPD killed another.

What we do know about the group has come from news reports, testimony from the hostages, and from John McClane himself. The group was led by known German terrorist Hans Gruber. Not much is known about his early life, but Hans at one point belonged to the West German terrorist group ‚ÄúVolksfrei,‚Äù but was kicked out for being too extreme for the group. Hostages have reported that when Hans took over the building, he cited Nakatomi‚Äôs worldwide greed as his motive and later made demands to the FBI for the release of half a dozen imprisoned terrorist groups around the world.

So why is the government saying that they were thieves?

It is reported by John McClane that the Hans‚Äô group were only pretending to be terrorists in order to cover their heist. But why would they break into a corporate building? Corporations use banks just like regular people, so if Hans truly wanted Nakatomi‚Äôs money, why wouldn‚Äôt he just break into one of their banks? And if he wanted the money, why would he waste time pretending to be a terrorist?  The simple answer is: he wouldn‚Äôt. None of Hans‚Äô actions are those of a thief but all are hallmarks of a terrorist. Even more damning is the initial news report that came out during the attack, [which explicitly calls the group terrorists](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/0a9b8b9e-fd6e-4350-8846-0c4ee113f50c).

It was only after the attack that the story was changed based on what John McClane claimed happened. **And yet, Nakatomi did not report a single dollar missing from their vault.**

Coincidence?

# 3. Holly McClane

Holly McClane is John McClane‚Äôs wife and worked as an executive for Nakatomi Corporation. She was involved in the suspicious business deal that also involved Harry Ellis and Joseph Takagi, but nothing else is known about her. But if Holly is married to John McClane, a New York City detective, why is she living in Los Angeles away from John, with her two children? What was Holly‚Äôs position in Nakatomi Corporation? Why is she the only executive involved with the deal who survived?

But none of that really matters, because there is one indisputable fact‚Äì**Holly McClane did not work for the Nakatomi Corporation.**

We have managed to procure a Nakatomi company directory from the night of the attack. **There is no Holly McClane listed in the company directory.**

Why would a person who was so indispensable to the company not even be listed in the company‚Äôs directory? And if she didn‚Äôt work for Nakatomi, what was she doing in the building? **Who is Holly McClane?**

# 4. The Police

Approximately 30 minutes after the terrorists first began taking hostages, LAPD dispatch sent Sgt. Alan Powell to investigate an alleged disturbance at Nakatomi Plaza.

Powell initially responded that there was nothing to report, but a few moments later, mysteriously began shouting, summoning back-up and special response teams to the area. Instead of ordering McClane to stand down, the LAPD inexplicably allowed him to continue operating within the building, ultimately costing Harry Ellis his life. The police sent in a SWAT team who were all wounded, followed by an armored personnel carrier that was destroyed by multiple RPG rockets.

But how did the terrorists know the armored carrier was coming? No hostages reported seeing the terrorists carrying anything but guns, so where did the missiles come from?

Perhaps there is a plausible explanation, but unfortunately we will never know, because only two terrorists survived to the end of the attack. The first was an American known as Theo Gilyard, Jr., a computer expert. It is, perhaps, a huge coincidence, that Theo is the only American and, more specifically, the only African-American that was involved with the group. Even more suspiciously, he was found in the parking garage while every other terrorist was found near the top of the building, and he was found with no weapons on him and not a single hostage recalls ever seeing him. **Despite this, Theo was convicted and sentenced to federal prison.**

The second man to initially survive was Karl Vreski, a German who was allegedly Hans Gruber‚Äôs second-in-command. Karl, well-placed to give details about the group‚Äôs plan and methods, was gunned down in the parking lot by none other than Sergeant Powell. Powell claims that Karl was attempting to shoot McClane and other hostages, but unfortunately, Officer Powell has a secret history regarding such matters. In the 70s, Sergeant Powell shot and killed a child on duty, believing that the child was pointing a gun at him. The ‚Äúgun‚Äù in question turned out to be a toy and Powell was taken off patrol for over a decade, **but never formally charged with a crime.**

If Karl really did pull a gun with dozens, possibly hundreds, of police officers at the scene, why was Sergeant Powell the only officer to have fired a shot? Even if what Sergeant Powell claims is true, why did he still found it necessary to shoot Karl 5 times, including once in the head, rather than attempt to disarm or incapacitate him? Unfortunately, we will never know and any hope of finding out what really happened in the Nakatomi building died with Karl.

# 5. John McClane

John McClane was born on May 23, 1955, in Plainfield, New Jersey. In 1977, McClane joined the New York City Police Department and, despite continual discipline problems, eventually rose to the rank of Detective. On the night of the attack, McClane had flown from New York to LA to be with Holly McClane who John claims is his wife, despite not even living on the same coast as her. McClane was driven directly from the airport to Nakatomi Plaza, not even stopping to say hello to his children, whom he claims were also living in LA with their mother. What‚Äôs more, he was driven in a limo, which McClane claims was paid for by Joseph Takagi. Why would Joseph pay for a limo to chauffeur the husband of a woman who didn‚Äôt even work for him? Unfortunately, we will never know because Takagi was killed in the attack that began only minutes after McClane arrived. The official story is that John hid during the initial assault and then proceeded to methodically eliminate the terrorists single-handedly, armed with nothing but his service weapon.

**This story is not possible for several reasons.** First, let‚Äôs focus on McClane‚Äôs alleged service weapon. McClane was reported to be carrying this gun, which is a Beretta 92 semi-automatic pistol, one of the most popular handguns in the world. But there‚Äôs just one problem: [In 1988, the NYPD did not use any semi-automatic handguns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department#Discontinued_from_service). From 1926 until 1986, officers were allowed to select from one of two .38 special revolvers. In 1986, the department switched to the Smith and Wesson Model 64, which was also a .38 Special revolver. It was not until 1994, six years after the attack on Nakatomi Plaza, that the NYPD began issuing semi-automatic weapons to their officers, and even then, the Beretta 92 was not one of the options. **Therefore, it is scientifically impossible for John McClane to be a New York City police officer.**

However, in 1988, there was a group that had selected the Beretta 92 as their standard issue firearm--the United States Navy SEALs. We attempted to contact the Navy to see whether John McClane had ever served as a SEAL, but were told that such information is conveniently classified.

Several hours into the attack, the hostages were herded on to the roof where they were to be picked up by FBI helicopters. As they approached the building, two agents reported seeing an unidentified man firing an automatic weapon at the helicopters. McClane later confessed that he was the shooter in question, and that he was attempting to scare the hostages off the helipad, which exploded minutes later and killed two FBI agents along with the helicopter‚Äôs crew. The Beretta M9 does not have the capability to fire in full-automatic mode, so why were we told that McClane was only carrying his service weapon? How did McClane manage to get these illegal weapons to Los Angeles when FAA regulations prohibit any person besides air marshals to carry a gun on an airplane?

Then there is the explosion itself. McClane claimed that he had not been shooting at the helicopter, but why would he shoot dangerously into the air, risking injury to the FBI agents and hostages, instead of just telling the hostages to get off the roof? And if he knew the helipad was about to explode, why didn‚Äôt he communicate this to the LAPD or FBI, despite being in radio contact with Sergeant Powell all night?

Finally, at the end of the stand-off, Hans Gruber was caught on national news falling 20 stories to his death, allegedly at the hands of John McClane. How could McClane have had time to break a window and throw Gruber out of it without Gruber trying to stop him? Why didn‚Äôt McClane, a police officer, attempt to detain Gruber rather than killing him? Indeed, from news footage, Gruber can be seen hanging from the window ledge for several seconds before falling, with McClane leaning over him. But the most shocking evidence of all is Gruber‚Äôs autopsy report, which noted that Gruber had been shot once in chest with a 9mm bullet. Another terrorist, Edward Hayden, was found on the floor from which Gruber fell, killed by a single 9mm gunshot to the head.

Joseph Takagi. Harry Ellis. Edward Hayden. And Hans Gruber.

**All people who died on December 24th, 1988, all people who were killed with a single, 9mm bullet.**

The same type of ammunition used by McClane‚Äôs Beretta 92 pistol.

Conspiracy theories are like a mind-virus that feeds on fear. Inciting people to talk about them with others. This only spreads the mind-virus! So how do you stop believing in one, once you've become infected?
First of all, I'm not going to share the specifics of what conspiracy theory I'm talking about. Because I don't want to spread this mind-virus. As the more momentum these theories get, the greater body of "evidence" and presence they gain upon the internet. This isn't doing anybody any favors. People think they're spreading "awareness" and trying to help others by "awakening them" to the truth. But it's all ultimately just going to be potentially infecting others with these sometimes quite intricately complex webs of fear-based delusions. That's my hot take on conspiracy theories.

So what the hell do you do when you find that you've accidentally begun to believe in one for yourself? I've become infected. Please help!

‚ÄôTis the Season to Debunk Your Family‚Äôs Hunter Biden Conspiracy Theories

Im way to invested in hollow earth theory.
I honestly don‚Äôt understand we have been told by Byrde there is holes to the center of the earth at the poles. Why cant we go explore. I feel the hollow earth theory is slept on physically and needs to be researched and explored by scientists. Most other attempts by pioneers to the center tragically ‚Äúdie‚Äùright before the expeditions. Or meet something stopping them from exploring, what are your opinions?
How Many Republicans Died Because the GOP Turned Against Vaccines?

I received this message on Instagram last night from someone I don‚Äôt know

How high was Queen Elizabeth when she nicknaned one of her agent "Putin"? Pun with french fries is so hilarious.
In short, there's theories in russian mostly rightwing circles that everything happened to ussr and afterward with Russia caused by UK intelligence service. In addition, Stalin was british spy (Hitler too) that destroyed potential of former russian empire, uk ensured ww2 between Reich and USSR. 
And yes stalin was indian and also was kicked out from irish pub in london for being to black. üòÇ
Does anyone remember the story about The Man From Taured???
I've been looking into that story quite a lot. Could that be a switch reality for that man? Could he be from a different reality? Some kind of parallel universe maybe? 

Please share your theories.

Ai sumilator runs the world
This is one of my favourites theories of whats going on , head of goverments are following instruction from ai who is better at analysing sociopolitic data then analists and experts. It could run a simulation about catastrophe and issue some orders , Covid was  a simulation to gather data about how people behave in disasters. It had to make sure it would be a  global catastrophe, like H1N1 and Ebola hence the lockdown . Now are running a simulation about war. AI is doing good at this echonomical war. It is collecting data , it is learning. Its also makes media terrify us by all those horrible news , its like the begining of an apocalypse or the third world war.
In a shock , so we would do whatever they tell us, so we don't oppose whats coming next , because it would be an existential threat to oppose . We will not oppose the genocide that will come later. There will be only 2 classes , them and us , masters and slaves , its the feudal system again but this time its under AI. So it would calculate revolutions . 
I say AI because i think the rushed decisions lately are confusing , questions are more then the answers , and answers feels weird 
Please excuse me for my bad english 
So what the possibility of that ? What do you think ?
JFK - Please explain
One recurring theory I've seen claims JFK was assassinated because he wanted to blow the lid off the CIA/FBI/MJ12/MIC/Illuminati (delete as appropriate)

But then when reading about the supposed NWO/secret society/one world government, the Kennedy family is often cited as being a part of these groups 

I feel like these conspiracies contradict each other. Am I missing something?

Actor rips crypto as 'largest Ponzi scheme in history'

Countries shouldn‚Äôt have an army force, it‚Äôs unnecessary

Why do we still have army forces? It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre constantly preparing for another world war to occur as we keep recruiting more people to fight a war that‚Äôs not even their own. That‚Äôs the thing, what are you fighting for? For your country yes, and the innocent people that inhabit it. 

But who started that war? The government. A small group of people with power decide they have a problem with another country and suddenly your life is on the line. Your job is to be a literal call of duty character, blindly shooting the enemy without cause or reason, purely because you are under the order to. Only difference is you don‚Äôt get to play again once you‚Äôve been shot.

It‚Äôs disgusting, the more you think about it.

The government actively promotes it. I remember at the end of high-school, many of my peers considered joining the army as an apprenticeship cause it was fair money and only physical work. That‚Äôs horrible how they just dangle cash in front of kids who are about to turn 18 in hopes they will mindlessly work as a human shield for them.

Violence is unnecessary. Us ‚Äúcommon people‚Äù are the ones who knows that, we want a world in peace, we want to live care free that our home down will be bombed. It is not the vast majority that encourages violence and war, so why is it happening?

And for such a ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù society we have a lot of barbaric wars happening around the globe. But wars have become trends. Even the Russian and Ukrainian war. People have lost their families, their homes, they left with just their life and the clothes on their backs. The media was all over that at the beginning, then the next ‚Äúbig thing‚Äù happened and the cameras moved away from the Ukrainian citizens left who have been left with nothing.

If the government didn‚Äôt have an army force, they‚Äôd have no physical power. They are too cowardly to fight for themselves. 

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor‚Äù
- System Of A Down (B.Y.O.B)
Who comes up with them?
What if these anti-vax conspiracies and such are *actually* a real conspiracy perpetuated by the elites to ensure that Mike Judge‚Äôs documentary Idiocracy does not in fact become true because then it would be too difficult to control the masses, and funnel money towards the top. Plus their yachts would sink from shitty craftsmanship.
Is the general sentiment for this sub pro crypto or pro CBDC?
With the coming launches of various worldwide central bank digital currencies, including the US‚Äôs, is this sub more pro crypto or CBDC? In real life, you won‚Äôt have the ability to pick neither without living entirely off the grid in nearly every way. So what‚Äôs the verdict?
CERN
Not really a conspiracy theory, more of a general theory. And this probably won‚Äôt make me any friends here, but here goes.

So I see a lot of people talking about how the large hadron collider coming online in 2012 either destroyed the world or caused us to hop into another timeline.  such a theory posits that there is a multi-verse of some sort. if we indeed hopped into another universe/ timelines, then it‚Äôs not a huge stretch to assume that there are many, perhaps, infinite universes that we may or may be in. 

That would mean that there are likely timelines where CERN blew up the planet, and timelines were they didn‚Äôt, but released some sort of demonic presence onto the planet. There‚Äôs probably even a timeline were, CERN never existed.

So it would follow logically that there is a timeline (perhaps many) where CERN started LHC and it worked exactly as the scientists expected. They smashed particles together and gleaned information about the universe based on those interactions. 

Nothing supernatural, or demonic just plain old particle physics. My theory is that it‚Äôs possible we may be in that timeline/ universe. Discuss.

Edited: last sentence to be more clear.
Do people actually believe the Rothschilds control everything?
I've been seeing a lot of tiktoks (all using the song California Dreaming) that say that the Rothschilds control everything.

TUPAC - Step father released from 37 years - New Theory
I know throughout the years we have heard multiple things about Tupac, and weather you like it or not, you have probably thought about it once or twice as well. Yes, it has gotten a little overplayed but after learning his step father was released from jail after 37 years due to having cancer and diminishing health, they have said he is no longer a threat and he can be released. I have read some things that have sparked a new-ish theory in my mind.

&#x200B;

His step father is not allowed to contact his sister AKA. Tupac's GOD mother. She was a black rights activist and fought with the black panthers, its hard not to think she may have had something to do with helping her god son escape. She was literally in jail and escaped after two armed guys came and got her... She fled to cuba and is still living there. Fidel helped her flee to cuba and she has remained there since. My wife just read that tupacs step father and his sister were not allowed to contact one another by law. Why wouldn't anyone think that she, having an established life in the 90s, wouldn't have the means to protect her GOD SON tupac.

Just have been thinking about it after learning these few things and not touching this fleeing death theory since highschool in the early 2000s :D
Are we asking the right questions or being given limited responses?
Let‚Äôs say we find out definitively that the human race never stepped foot on the moon. What then? ‚ÄúAh ha, you lied! We knew it!‚Äù But what then? What does it change right now? 

For decades society has been asking questions about many different ‚Äúconspiracies‚Äù. Are they the right questions? Some answers have been found/given but are they the limited responses/answers? 

Are we asking the right questions? What are your thoughts?‚úåüèª
Here‚Äôs a theory. Possible?

Is shadow government really a thing?
Yeah it‚Äôs the question. We all see that  guy saying ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù again and again,and THEY wants to keep you poor,THEY grow rich , THEY does this,THEY does that. Who exactly are THEY? Are THEY just rich people?or is there something more than that?is there a whole deep state down there ?is that entirely controlled by government or any superior power than government?
Coordinated worldwide strikes?
In the UK there is currently a lot of striking going on which is basically shutting down the country (it doesn‚Äôt take much). Strikes by nurses, postal workers, rail workers. 

Now I am reading about strikes in Canada by health care workers. Australia seems to be having a lot of strikes. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other places too. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it before. 

To me it seems like this could be some sort of coordinated plan to privatise some industries possibly? A power grab? It‚Äôs just so strange it‚Äôs happening everywhere at the same time. Getting deja vu. 

What are your thoughts?

James Krause is only a pawn in something bigger involving bigger players
There‚Äôs been a lot of funky judging lately, and combined with the James Krause controversy I started thinking maybe it was too much of a coincidence timing wise. It might make sense that UFC brass, if they were involved in something nefarious, that they could pay James Krause a large sum of money, who with all due respect, was never the greatest fighter, and never seemed that good at coaching despite his passion for it, might just have sold his soul to the devil. Krause is a fall guy to keep investigators chewing on a 2000 discord subscriber distraction bone.

Masculinity is being enraged by young boys and it‚Äôs planned
Im sure you are aware of Andrew Tate, maybe Sneako or Hamza, most of these ‚ÄúTikTok‚Äù influencers are getting portrayed in the media as a bad influence, mostly because of their presentation of traditional values, most of the stuff being told to the audience aren‚Äôt wrong at all or not near as viewed as ‚Äútoxic‚Äù

Most of the goals for the influences is to teach men how to work themselves to the top, but ofc of the social media pressure of them tryna remove traditional values from men, it has become a big topic, especially for the audience, anyone that realizes that the ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù/elites are tryna present a weak lifestyle you can have, are getting curious and enraged

After taking a step back I thought for a second, as you guys know the Testosterone levels have dropped since 1980, what if this whole ‚Äúmasculinity removal‚Äù is a setup to attempt to restore Testosterone to young boys? If you go at Google Trends you can see Testosterone is at its top, never been so high, and if you look at TikTok/YouTube Shorts you can see that those masculinity vids have over 150k likes

I have a suspicion that the World Cup final was staged!
I didn‚Äôt know where I should post this but I needed to post it because I need to tell someone but if I tell anyone in person they‚Äôll just think it‚Äôs batshit and it is‚Ä¶

I recently saw something with big football players like Ronaldo and Messi doing Masonic poses/symbols, it was also noted that Manchester City wear Masonic colours/the club colours are the Masonic colours because the club was saved from bankruptcy by Free Masons a long time ago, indicating the potential influence of ‚Äòthe powers that be‚Äô. (There is a bit in this article referencing what I‚Äôm talking about) https://www.ugle.org.uk/discover-freemasonry/what-is-freemasonry

Anyway, it could have something to do with that, or Qatar could‚Äôve used some of their astounding wealth and paid the players/teams obscene amounts of money to fix the match in order to make it more interesting.

The way that France was playing so poorly to begin with, letting Argentina get ahead, it almost seemed intentional.

The game was just unbelievably cinematic, you know, sometimes reality is stranger than fiction and all that but I do believe this is a possibility, just how back and forth the match was with each team seemingly switching on and off multiple times.

It was certainly an incredible game from a spectators point of view, people are going to remember how great the Qatar World Cup final was, Lionel Messi‚Äôs winning his final World Cup appearance vs France, home to none other than PSG owned Mbappe, you know, the team that is owned by Qatar, oh yeah, not to mention that Messi ALSO plays for PSG, their two star players clashing, head to head in the grand finale.

Maybe I wasn‚Äôt particularly observant but it also seemed like the French were pretty unphased by the loss, like they had already anticipated the loss beforehand, maybe it‚Äôs just a cultural thing to be inexpressive though.

I know it‚Äôs a long long shot and I‚Äôm not saying I believe one version of events more than the other (As in, maybe the game wasn‚Äôt fixed) but I have been having this thought and I just needed to get it out lol

Apocalytpic meteorites, are they a bigger threat than we think?
I‚Äôve read up quite a bit on the younger dryas period and the potential meteor shower that hit earth 12800 years ago, and the DEVESTATING effect that it had (hit the northern ice cap on earth, causing 200m high floods worldwide, and the melting of the last ice age, and so I went down a meteor rabbit hole.

I found out about the 99942 Apophis meteor, which is a meteor of almost apocalyptic scale (like a few hundred/thousand nuclear bombs). It will pass earth VERY closely on april 13 2029, but it isn‚Äôt calculated as a large threat yet (2.7% chance if hitting). However, the biggest problem is that gravity is in the equation. 
The 99942 Apophis is calculated to change it‚Äôs trajectory towards earth after this close call (31000 km from earth if I remember correctly). Of course i trust our math, the problem is our math shows it WILL be a threat pretty soon, equations calculate it will hit earth around 2050/2060, which seems long, but most of us will be alive. And it will only come closer each lap, if not by 2060, then it will probably hit us by 2090.

I think this is why (rich) people are looking to leave earth and find a new habitable planet, because the earth is constantly passing through meteor storms, and it‚Äôs inevitable that one large shower will hit earth on an apocalyptic scale. 

What so you guys think? Am I paranoid or are we doomed?
Modern movies are written by AI.
Has anyone watched any of the slop that's being shoveled onto streaming services like there is no tomorrow? Most of it doesn't seem human. It seems machine made. It's got an almost uncanny valley feel to all of it. Some, if not most, of the lines are not written by an actual person. It's gotta be a computer.

I have no proof of any of this to back it up, but my conspiracy is that most things written today and put into streaming services is AI written to save money on labor costs. The large tech conglomerates in streaming have a ton of resources to create amazing story generators that they plug in a few keywords and poof, generic Christmas movie #544a25 is born.

Happy holidays, dead Internet people.

Just looking for anyones input. Debates welcome :)
There‚Äôs a conspiracy theory about Mars that states that prior to humans living on earth, they lived on Mars. They basically did the same evolution shit we have done already but went further. They destroyed their own planet to literally nothing. Global warming, wars, etc. Hypothetically this would‚Äôve been ridiculously long ago, so by now there wouldn‚Äôt be anything left but fossils buried deep in mars‚Äô crust, and microscopic elements hiding within its dirt (which ironically we are finding signs of water and life on mars being there many many many years ago) 

The conspiracy continues about how during this ‚Äúfinal stage‚Äù of Mars‚Äô life and the living things that inhabited it, some part of the civilization built a ‚Äúspace ship‚Äù as an escape in a last ditch effort. (Think of literally any ‚ÄúArk‚Äù in any movie about everyone dying by planets getting destroyed or massive natural disasters) 

Now this is where the conspiracy gets kinda split. There‚Äôs two theories at this point. 
1.) The plan was to land on earth, but a majority of the space ships crash landed and burnt up in the atmosphere. Being that Mars‚Äô atmosphere is thinner, the theory is whoever made these escape crafts didn‚Äôt calculate properly for the size of the ship and the increase in gravity and all that. So only a few actually survived - leaving ‚ÄúAdam and Eve‚Äù to repopulate the earth. 
2.) ‚ÄúAdam and Eve‚Äù were a spaceship that crash landed onto earth somehow, separated from the rest of the fleet which was headed out of our galaxy somewhere else, and the inhabitants of the ship is what made our population. 

There‚Äôs a lot more that goes into these theories, even stuff that ties into biblical stuff, which would make these stories in the Bible true, but not the way we see them as. There very well could‚Äôve been someone with ‚Äúpowers‚Äù that helped us, if not multiple people. Hence Greek and Roman mythology. These ‚Äúaliens‚Äù from Mars had a higher connection with the energy in our universe and tried to give us the abilities to avoid the shit they did. 

I don‚Äôt have a source for any of this information as it‚Äôs not very well known or most people automatically reject the theory, however with the newer technology we keep gaining and the things we are finding not only on our planet but others, I can‚Äôt imagine what civilizations outside out of little galaxy can do. There‚Äôs absolutely no way we are the only living things in this universe. Absolutely no goddamn way.
Just a thought about Twitter and TikTok.
Elon Musk has turned Twitter into a massive dumpster fire. Today, a bipartisan bill to ban TikTok comes out.

So....if people wanted to get the word out about mass protests, how would they do it? Seems like wrecking social media is a good way to keep the masses from protesting.

Anybody else feel like Musk's commitment to destroying Twitter and the timing of the TikTok ban seem a little too "coincidental"?
Same day as bipartisan bill to ban TikTok. I don't recall seeing YouTube Shorts advertised in the World Cup before today. Coincidence?
Maybe I just didn't notice it before and only noticed it today because of the news. Has anyone seen a field-side ad for YouTube Shorts before today this WC?

In your opinion, how do you distinguish between conspiracy and paranoia?
I am currently doing some background research for an article I am writing. I am specifically interested in how technology is used to establish/deny conspiracies. Specifically, I am interested about online content moderation. 

- If someone describes a conspiracy online, when is it OK to censor them? I ask this because I feel that censoring sometimes backfires because people can interpret it as proof that someone is trying to suppress the truth. 

- In your opinion, how do you distinguish between conspiracy and paranoia?

Thank you.
Prominent DeSantis ally, Florida political donor found dead, was under investigation

The rise of strongmen Saving the system without breaking the system. Can it be done?
Really great discussion on the rise of the "strongman" archetype, and it's 4 common denominators across the globe:

*four cross-cutting characteristics that are common to the strongmen style:  the creation of a cult of personality; contempt for the rule of law; the claim to represent the real people against the elites‚Ä¶ and a politics driven by fear and nationalism.‚Äù*




https://archive.ph/YmMmo#selection-1489.0-1509.639



To that I would add - misogyny. 



I'm particularly interested in this question posed:



*What can be done about strongmen? I think one problem is that if one side is willing to be amoral and to break the rules of decorum and laws and so forth, it‚Äôs kind of hard to use the rules to try to defeat them. Of course, the temptation is to also go low, but that inevitably presents a ton of problems in and of itself. Not the least of which is that if you do that then you‚Äôre playing the other guy‚Äôs game. So, is democracy the best answer, the only answer, or is democracy problematic because after all, history teaches us that even strongman types can actually be elected?*


For some reason the link is looping, edited to add link.
Lockerbie suspect‚Äôs extradition was part of Griner / Bout exchange

I was just in Cancun at a resort for a wedding, and I must‚Äôve had 40-50 drinks in one day. From 7am to 3am and I was not in bad shape. I could NEVER do this back home without dying. Since we‚Äôre in at a hot pool/beach party all day and in Mexico, it was of course Margaritas, pina coladas, daiquiris, etc. even shots! Only time I really started feeling drunk was when I had a few beers. I‚Äôm guessing they do this to keeps guests from not blacking out and puking by noon as pretty much everyone is drinking heavily. A couple weeks after I made myself ONE margarita at home and I felt buzzed. Idk, it just has to be the case or else I‚Äôd be dead and not writing this right now.
The lottery is a scam that no one ever really wins.
When you buy a lottery ticket, the numbers you choose (or are "randomly" generated for you) are uploaded into a central database. The lottery people then scan the database before the drawing and only choose a combination of "winning" numbers which weren't selected by anyone. This allows them to make endless amounts of money without ever having to pay any of it back. The people who allegedly win and are interviewed are paid actors, and the stuff they show on TV with the lotto balls blowing around in a glass bowl (if they still even do that, I don't know) is an illusion meant to make you believe it's random.

There is a reason why Russia Invaded Ukraine this year

As some people may know. The USSR was formed in December 30 1922. Almost 100 years ago. My theory is that Russia hoped to quickly invade Ukraine in 2022 (hence the border exercises months before the invasion) invade or annex Belarus to form a Union State between Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. Putin probably hoped to accomplish all of this just before the 100th anniversary of the USSR.

Why aren‚Äôt there more conspiracy theories about railroad companies, and govt intervention in potential railroaders‚Äô strike?
This story has everything: honest people who work for a living, greedy executives, and the government stepping on workers‚Äô necks. But there are like no conspiracy theories about this. Why is that, do you think?
There are already parallel universes
If you study religions, the difference between Christianity and Islam really comes down to the crucifixion of Jesus.

The crucifixion and resurrection was a key factor in Christianity coming to what it is today.

Islam denies that it happened.

Therefore, we're living in two different worlds running parallel at the same time.

One where Jesus died and was resurrected, and the other where Jesus wasn't.

I guess there's also a third where you believe none of it.

It's really no different than a feudal system, whereby the security and stability of a large number of other people are entirely dependent on the whim, hubris and patronage of this one person. And, just like a cult, they worship him. They hinge on his every word or action.

Who the fuck is Arch Cummin?
Epstein bought his Island from someone named‚Ä¶ Arch Cummin. You read that right. seriously? Arch Cummin is what I would name my fkn sims character, and there is NOTHING on this person online, except one mugshot I found on duckduck.go, appearently this Arch Cummin lives by the coast in Palm Beach pretty close to the Island. I wonder why there is literally nothing else on this ‚Äùperson‚Äù online

Edit; found more. His public records include rape and and sexual assault on a child. His records can for some reason not be accessed through the gov site nsopw.gov, which is very strange. There is a preview where multiple of ‚ÄùArch Cummin‚Äôs‚Äù aliases are listed however, including ‚ÄùCumham, Arcie L‚Äù and ‚ÄùCunningham, Butch Lee‚Äù. Googled ‚ÄùCumham, Arcie L‚Äù and top result is sex offender register, not the .gov however, but one that has sourced from government documents, hmmmm

Controlling the weather.
I listened to a fellow the other day (he was not at my table but he was loud) as he was talking about how the governments are controlling the weather using chemtrails from jets. I kinda think that if we could control the weather it would be getting better. We are having droughts, floods, heat domes, etc etc etc.... So if someone is controlling the weather they are doing a shit job of it. By the way there is no such thing as a chemtrail it is even tagged as a spelling mistake. They are contrails. Which is short for condensation trail.
the real mr sketch conspiracy

In these troubling times it may seem like the problems are endless, but I don't hear anyone talking about one of the worst things plaguing this nation; scented markers. Writing utensils that smell vaguely like a fruit or berry or something else that would reasonably smell good. seems like a perfectly innocent invention. Something for the kids to enjoy,  However, you would be shocked to learn that scented markers serve a much more sinister purpose. The FDA was created to regulate food and drugs, and markers conveniently apply to neither of those. The legal system allows scented markers to slip by without having to be tested for safety or even listing what is in them. So what purpose could they serve? Even without regulations they're just some stupid product for the kids right? WRONG. I present to you exhibit A: the bradford mr sketch scented watercolor blue raspberry marker. First of all, the mere existence of this thing is insane to think about. Something that leaves streaks of color on paper that panders to our hunger for a nonexistent fruit. That alone is sketchy enough, but then I did my research on the company. Sanford markers is a subdivision of the sharpie company which is a subdivision of newell brands. The owner of all that is a man named Carl Icahn. Carl is already a suspicious person. He showed up out of nowhere with 150k and immediately became a big investor in new york. So I went to his personal blog. Here he presents himself as a humanitarian who fights for better treatment of pigs in the food industry. This is a really good cause but my gut tells me Carl is only doing all this to look better to the public. So I dug deeper. Carl was a dead end for now, but remember his name for later. Scented markers were created in 1964 by American inventor Charles Weiss, there is very little info on him. I searched all the records I could and found concrete evidence that Charles Weiss served in the US army in 1942. His details are shady to say the least. No picture, no info aside from a name. It's like his slate was wiped. Is it really a coincidence that this guy served the government right smack dab in the middle of MK ultra? there is no other possibility than factscented markers were created for the purpose of mind control! The thing that makes the scented markers smell good is something called esters. Esters are a relatively new invention that is involved in practically everything you consume. Processed foods, fertilizers, alcoholic beverages, literally everything. What a surprise processed foods and esters as a whole became mass-produced right after WW2. The way I see it, Charles Weiss created scented markers with the new mind control technology he was introduced to in his service.in a study conducted by the human health bureau, it was concluded that a subdivision of esters used in scents called P.A.E.‚Äôs effect the reproductive system, endocrine system, and most importantly, the nervous system. Not only are esters used for mind control, but scented markers are also used for eugenics to keep the rich at the top. When was the last time you saw a scented marker at a private school? You haven't. In fact, scented markers are banned in most non-public schools. Their reasoning is that they see them as a distraction, however what if its only the government-funded schools that allow scented markers for the purpose of artificially defertilizing all of the poor? There are lots of possibilities with these little markers of evil. While its still generally unstudied, animal testing shows that esters negatively effect the subject. Its clear esters are a product of the mind control experiments conducted by the government. Mr sketch markers still say non-toxic on their box though, how is that possible with all these proven negative effects? Remember Carl Icahn? With his wealth and charles invention, it's very likely Carl bribed the coca-cola company to label the product as non-toxic.if you ever at any point in your life innocently sniffed a goofy scented marker, it's too late for you.
Mall Kiosks
Every year around this time mall kiosks pop up. Now they are the same at every mall, for the most part, and always show up just for the Christmas shopping season.

Putin manufactures 'Culture Heroes.'
A theory: Putin creates these types like Musk or Julian Assange or Sam Bankman-Fried (where did that billion dollars go?) via, overrly or covertly, slipping them information/disinformstion, or funding or social media over decades, tries to make them 'culture heroes' in this and other western states, all while funding fascist online presences, all to continually lead us towards fascism. 

When we think of Musk, due to such social media fawning, we automatically think 'genius,' 'maverick,' 'space flight' and that car he sent towards Mars, yet all he does is create right wing chaos, support for every Russian position regarding Ukraine, and bolster olicharcs.

(Not to mention that, no, his cars explode, his transport tunnels are a joke, and he never invented a fucking thing.)

We've been influenced into accepting these and other types, famous or not, as culture heroes via a weaponized social media, all the while ignoring what they're actually doing. Time to wake the fuck up.
Call me crazy, but just in case my wild theory is correct...
I feel like maybe Kanye West may turn out to be this generation's Andy Kaufman.  Although some sort of psychological imbalance could explain a large majority of his activities... I believe that it may be more plausible that he is exacting a form social parody in an attempt to weaponize Trump's exploitable ignorance in order to cause irreparable damage to that campaign.  Basically... Is Ye martyring his reputation to prevent Trump from regaining power?  And further... Has he replaced music with a form of relentless expression of satire, maybe even a masterful troll?

A little far fetched, maybe... But also maybe consider that the recent controversy involving Ye started with an incendiary statement that leads to the utter condemnation of his brand- followed by a seemingly ill-advised meeting with Trump at the peak of his ostracization- with a known white supremesist dinner guest cherry on top.  

Am I to believe that Kanye West has become a real-life black white supremesist?  That a man that built a billion-dollar brand has been masterfully reprogrammed by Donald Trump to aid in the social regression he represents?

I'll accept your criticisms on this.  I just think this can actually  be an interesting thought experiment.
Streamers are Scammers?
I heard from an inside source at Activision that big name & mid level Streamers are paying Video Game companies for access to bot servers in Battle Royale game modes. The idea being they can easily win, and make insane content that the average player could not. They get solid footage, the game gets well promoted, and the players/viewers feel inadequate, so push/play/spend/harder. I thought it seemed pointless until I considered the cost/profit capabilities, and watched some of of the higher level streamers doing some ridiculous things.

It could go a lot deeper, who knows. A lot of what is happening in gaming right now not only feels like a scam, but can be factually backed up as profiteering. We know game companies make contracts with streamers, so why wouldn‚Äôt they continually support them to boost their product?
What do Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Kanye (Ye) West, Tucker Carlson, Kevin McCarthy, Alex Jones, Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens and Vladimir Putin all have in common?

iPhone LIVE photos are actually revealing how creepy and invasive ‚Äúthey‚Äù are!
I just had a thought, when I take a photo on my iPhone, the LIVE feature shows three seconds after I snapped the picture BUT ALSO the three seconds before. And that begs the question‚Ä¶ how did it know I was going to push the button!? Does that mean they are always recording and storing the footage and it‚Äôs just when I have pushed the button I get a copy? It‚Äôs similar to how Siri Alexa and Echo must always be listening to hear you say their names. How have we overlooked this

Elon VS Apple
Xi Jin Ping is using government lockdowns to target American Businesses so that It hurts the US economy, as many US companies are invested in Apple. Elon is being paid by Xi Jin Ping to make Apple sound like an Authoritarian company against free speech. China is paying Elon to keep Twitter full of bots, so Russia and China can influence the US social Media trends through Twitter. The US government is investigating Elon because Elon has his business ties with Russia and China. The CIA is fighting back by creating civil unrest and riots in China, in hopes that China's authoritarian government is dismantled.

We are in an Economic war and Elon Musk is not on Team USA

Why do we even protest
If protesting has no effect in making change why don‚Äôt we encourage the idea of hitting leaders where it hurt‚Ä¶. Money. Why don‚Äôt we collectively go on strike or boycott. Wouldn‚Äôt that make politicians be scared to extort us and incentives to make changes in our favor.
Auto stop in cars and trucks is just a way to slowly acclimate us to electric vehicles having no engine noise.
My theory is that the auto off ‚Äúfeature‚Äù of modern cars is to acclimate drivers to the lack of engine noise in electric cars.  So when gas vehicles get phased out the public is already use to the lack of noise and aren‚Äôt off put by it like people were in the early iterations of Tesla.
Nike is working directly with third party sellers like Goat or Stock X
After a relatively recent lawsuit against Stock X by Nike it has been proven that inner level Nike employees use these services. [https://twitter.com/brendandunne/status/1524422358966185985?s=20&t=rekXGTAu9tQs0XwuCpTrDQ](https://twitter.com/brendandunne/status/1524422358966185985?s=20&t=rekXGTAu9tQs0XwuCpTrDQ)

Nike themselves have been acting like they want to stop resellers with a recent change with bot detection. However this is most likely a way to cover up factthat they have been working with these companies from the start. Working with these companies would only make sense for executives at Nike as they could sell their product for an inflated price while paying these companies a sliver. This would be a situation where everyone wins, besides the consumer. The recent lawsuit with these companies is a blatant cover up to try and further prove that the two companies (Nike and Stock X) have no affiliation.
First time talking about my experience.
This happened alittle over 13 years ago, I was home from college and had to move into my brother's room because my grandfather had moved in with my family. I don't know what time it was but I do remember it being winter time. I was awaken by what felt like something staring at me through a window about 10 ft off the ground. I saw 3 figures in the window I tried to yell but nothing happened and had an absolute sense of fear then the feeling of falling asleep. I woke up the next morning with the memory of those 3 figures staring at me. I have never told anyone about it but I still vividly remember it.
It looks like Musk doesn't believe in having "free speech" after all:

Notice Kanye, Musk - a lot of people going kind of crazy with Republican QAnon conspiracies right now? Very interesting, I think.

Twitter fingers
Since all the banned accounts are coming back next week screenshots of old tweets are going be coming up ready to see some cancellations?
Hacking attacks are interlinked to the governments?
Hacking attacks play a crucial role in any war, if you look closely you can make it out that many of the hacking attacks that somehow targets only a specific government body harms the other governing body/country. I am not going to point any related to current affairs, you be the judge.

What we do not understand is that governments use shady names pretending to be a activists group to carry out such tasks. They pretend to catch them for months untill the news & media divert the minds of people to some other issue. Most of the times, news spread shit amoung the mass to keep them dumb. It is always a war between the governments of different countries.

There are real hacker activists, but we rarely know about them as they never make it to the news. Governments do not want you to know their shady practices.
HR is involved in illegally fixing salaries across companies and countries
For as long as I can remember, job hopping every couple of years would nearly guarantee a 15% salary increase, and jumping after 5+ years could easily provide a 30% increase. 

Lately however, it seems like all jobs in North America in my line of work (a niche corner of Engineering) pay roughly the same, regardless of Canadian province or American state.

We have all heard of illegal price fixing between companies when selling products or services. 

It is also widely understood that HR is there to protect the company's interests, not the employee's. 

Also, most companies are boasting record profit margins these days.

Finally, in spite of employees constantly telling upper management that we need higher salaries to compensate for the significant increase in cost of living, we are firmly and confidently told that we are highly valued but are getting paid fair market value. 

Putting it all together, I believe there is salary fixing going on across North America that may be borderline illegal.

Why does the US have the constitution?
With all of these theories about the elite, WEF, etc, I just started wondering about why the US has the constitution. I feel things like the second amendment separates the US from the rest of the pack, and I also feel like if Americans didn‚Äôt have these rights, things would be very different globally. However, as an example, I believe history was being tampered with well before the US came around, which means certain people were already in power. So why is the US government set up like it is? Do you guys think the founding fathers were truly good guys?
I remember Clinton testified under oath and answered questions for hours - both of them! But Trump, Pence and all GOP Leaders still refuse to testify about Jan. 6 after almost two years. Why?
I thought Benghazi was a load of bullshit - the GOP manufacturing fake theatre like WWE to enrage their voter base.

But I'm glad Hilary Clinton answered her summons and showed up and testified!

I'm old enough to remember *both* Clintons testifying under oath.

But ZERO Republican members of Congress have testified under oath.

Not Trump, not Mike Pence, not Kevin McCarthy, not Mitch McConnell - everyone at the center of the terrorist attack to hang all of them and "overturn" the election, all refuse to testify?

Aides have stepped forward, Capitol Police including military veterans testified under oath at great personal risk.

But ZERO Republican Leaders?

Are they planning on taking their first hand witness testimony to the grave with them?

Why is that? They are going to stall until they can win back power in the next election?

Does the GOP now transcend all limitations?

Even the richest people in the world can't stall a summons from Congress - but now all these Republican Leaders are refusing and launching counter investigations into all their enemies (i.e. all of us)?

They install their hyper corrupt GOP judges to give them protection for their betrayals - all for their abortion bounties, tax cuts to the rich, suicidal climate change denial, and literal bloody coups.

How is it both the Clintons are infinitely less corrupt than all GOP politicians, because they showed up to testify and answers questions, but the GOP seed lies and conspiracies and hide behind their followers.
a theory after reading his biography: Putin wants WWIII
If you've been paying attention, Putin has been the world's most deadly dictator for decades now. There is so much blood on his name, it lands him up there with Hitler and Stalin.

I feel like he's been trying to force NATO to get involved because there's a nuclear stalemate. No one wants to make a first strike because they'd be obliterated, so conventional warfare is coming back. It will be slow, with various fronts opening up in Eastern Europe.

Wars are good for business. There has been economic upturn after the end of each world war. The winners build back better. We are in bad economic times. 

The likes of Putin have absolutely no regard for human life or even the most basic law, only greed and the lust to conquer. Russia's economy is collapsing, it has already been in a bad state for ages. War, again, is profitable.

tldr: I worry that Putin is calling the west's nuclear bluff because he wants WWIII, wants even more wealth and resources. I fear that nukes' power to induce a fear of mutually assured destruction is gone because everyone knows that they don't want to use them.

edit: this was such a ramble when I posted it earlier. I've cleaned it up to be clearer.
So Ghislaine is said to have been gone into hiding when she was wanted. What if they simply knew where she was and they were just liaising with her on the way forward?

Do you think media (TV) and Hollywood use reverse psychology in the topics or subject matter of their productions?
Idk if I worded that question the best, but this is something I‚Äôve always thought. I‚Äôm currently watching The Pentaverate and it reminded me of this idea I‚Äôve had for awhile. Do you guys think in movies and shows they try to make things seem like even more of a fictional idea because it‚Äôs in a fictional movie and almost play some sort of reverse psychology type thing to make certain things seem even more bizarre of an idea or theory to possibly exist in the real world in order to detour people from further thinking about or theorizing on what that idea or subject may be. Or even the opposite do you guys think movies and shows touch up on certain topics to ease into the idea of different theories , like how to me it seems like alien based movies were heavily pushed and very popular for awhile, and then now recently the govt confirms UFO sightings. I think about the possibility of both, but more so the reverse psychology idea. Coz I know in certain pieces it‚Äôs almost as if they include things just to wave it in faces of sheep as if they‚Äôre mocking them coz they know they‚Äôll never understand what they‚Äôre actually seeing or listening to. Idk just all stuff that I‚Äôve often thought about and like I said to me personally it seems likely as if they‚Äôre playing the reverse psychology card.

A Lasting Legacy of Covid: Far-Right Platforms Spreading Health Myths

Republican politicians seed us with conspiracies about President Biden being "senile" and a "failure" and corrupt to create a mirror shield for their own hyper-insane self-deluding cult destruction and endless failure. So then they can say "both sides are the same."
The only way they can rationalize this entire Trump nightmare freakshow is to drag their main enemy - President Biden - down to the same level as them.

We see these disgusting Trump children aiding in their father's freak cult, feeding off it for massive profit at the expense of our communities and families.

So of course they *need* Hunter Biden's laptop, like they *needed* Hilary Clinton's emails and "pizza pedophile place".

This is their new Benghazi. They create their own reality and demand aggressive loyalty to their lies and punish all those who refuse to play along with these sadistic Republican games.

So the Trump children dabble in fascist cults and cancerous corruption and betrayals - and Hunter Biden has his laptop.

*Both sides are the same.*

Of course, we all know these GOP politicians and Fox News are living in their own self-deluded fantasy world.

Call me *senile*, but I think President Biden's agenda - like affordable childcare, climate change reduction, infrastructure and voting rights are infinitely better than Republican agenda- like abortion bounties, tax cuts for the rich, suicidal climate change denial, and literal bloody coup attempts.

I don't care about a politician's age or anything - just who has the best climate change plan, best handle on complex geopolitics, intelligence dealing with Russia and China.

That is Biden, not these GOP politicians and their QAnon clown cult.

All this talk about Hunter Biden, but they still refuse to testify about what they did on Jan. 6, they still impose abortion bounties, still obstruct affordable childcare.

Mike Pence, Kevin McCarthy, Mitch McConnell still *refuse to testify under oath about the attack on the Capitol after TWO YEARS.*

I thought Benghazi was bullshit - but I remember Clinton showing up to testify! Both Clintons testified under oath for hours!

Which makes them infinitely less corrupt than all the GOP politicians put together.

The GOP can craft infinite reasons why they believe Biden is a terrible president and Trump, DeSantis or some other Republican should take over.

But all of these are self-deluding lies - the reality is Biden is competing with Obama to be the best president in the last 30 years - while Bush was a disaster and Trump was the worst rapist traitor failure batshit insane terrorist Fox News freak we've ever seen.

Bush was a disaster, but nobody ever worried he was going to terrorist attack his own Capitol to hang the Vice President and Congress. That is a new level of detached dangerous insanity.

The GOP should be learning from Biden, agreeing with what works and pushing better alternatives where he is lacking.

Where is the GOP climate change plan? I remember Al Gore and the Democrats wanted to lower emissions in 2000.

It's TWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER, they still have no plan except to obstruct and sabotage whatever the Democrats acheived.

Obama and Biden were the first to lower emissions in US history since the Industrial Revolution - who better to lower them again?

Abortion Bounties, decades of suicidal climate change denial and sabotage, $1,900,000,000,000 in tax cuts for the rich, literal bloody coup attempts, an ex President psychopath stalker who won't leave us alone.

Where is the GOP's affordable childcare? They got time for abortion bounties, nothing for pre-K or school infrastructure?

They can't just flood the zone with attacks on Democrats and Biden and get away with endless treasons and disasters like this.

Republican politicians have to create their own opposite world, where Biden is senile and corrupt and Trump and the GOP are unfair victims.

They tie their actions to their base of tens of millions of voters.

Trump will openly praise neo Nazis and call them his lovers - and then the GOP brainwash their followers to insist in never happened and demand evidence.

Like were you all asleep on Jan. 6? He was openly praising neo Nazis "I love you, you're very special. Never forget this day."

They're practicing this behavior of mass amnesia and bullying to make their treason disappear.
Fuck Anti-vaxx Assholes

Kennedy Assasination
I found myself in Dallas today and was driving the West End area where JFK was assassinated. One things I‚Äôve always wondered: why didn‚Äôt the secret service or local law enforcement not secure all the buildings along the route? Perhaps it‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt assess threats the same way, but this seems like a critical oversight that was missed. I‚Äôve been reading about the secret service agent who was with JFK the whole time (Kellerman), but I can‚Äôt find any sort of route reconnaissance that was ever discussed or published. What am I missing?
What do you think of Japans behaviour at the Fifa world cup?
They‚Äôve helped staff clean stadiums as well as cleaning up their locker room after a match. As far as I know this is a first for them at the Fifa world cup. Is this a ‚Äògood act‚Äô? Or is it positive publicity/ attraction/ advertisement or a distraction?
Rigged Gas pumps
I noticed when pumping gas it constantly stops pumping but everytime it stops the numbers jump up by 10 or 20. It doesnt matter how far in I stick the nozzle I can put just the tip and get same results. It happens at every gas station I have been to. It seems like a way to give people less than what they already paid a ridiculous amount for.
Michael Cohen: Ivanka Left Trump Campaign Because She's an FBI Mole

Elon Musk is being paid to intentionally destroy Twitter in order to limit free speech worldwide.
Elon Musk is being paid to intentionally destroy Twitter in order to limit free speech worldwide.

Most media companies are owned by billionaires and Twitter has been used for whistleblowers and human rights activist worldwide to criticize companies and governments. Twitter was purchased by Elon Musk using Saudi debt. I believe that the apparent idiocy he has used thus far while owner of the platform is actually a strategic effort to devalue the company, encourage employees to quit, and delegitimize verified users who use the platform for good. The harm that Twitter did to authoritarian governments and companies was worth way more than the 45B$ investment in shutting it down.

Something new in the air?
At least in southern Texas, over the last few months the outside air seems to make my eyes sting now. And it's not winter weather, I've lived in Minnesota before and dealt with worse. I don't recall when it first started, but it feels like smoke in my eyes, yet there's no smell of smoke. Could it be something like "chemtrails" having a new additive or some other aerial dispersal of something? Anyone else notice something like this happening anywhere else, a feeling of smoke in the eyes without smoke?
Old dollar store or something else??
I live in a fairly decent sized city in California, and when I first moved here in 2015 I use to always go to this one dollar store close to a Northgate. It had its separate parking lot and the building next to it is out of business and has been empty for years and the other side is just dead grass and dirt. Even then no one really visited the dollar store, at most there was only 2 to 3 cars parked one usually belonging to the owner. My friend and I decided to see if it was still open a couple days ago, and it was. The door was locked but the owner unlocked it to let us shop. The shelf‚Äôs were about 60% empty, and you can tell he hasn‚Äôt stocked up in ages. Lots of things were expired, and some things are just straight up dusty. Walking in there also felt like time traveling just because most of the items have off huge early 2000‚Äôs energy. My friend and I realized there was just no way he‚Äôs making any money from this store. The lot was huge and keep in mind this is California so renting that place must be so expensive, not to mention electricity too. We think that this dollar store could be a possible cover up for something else?? I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions. What do you guys think?
Dan Bilzerian Conspiracy
Does anybody know that how Dan Bilzerian got so rich? In interviews he says that he plays poker and have his business but if u ask any pro poker player he says that no one  can ever earn this level of money by playing poker. So here comes the conspiracy that his dad was a thief and he had hide 3 or 30 million dollars I don't know the perfect number but it's any of those and the money he had hide doesnot know where he had kept it not even the police.So ig that tells us all.

I think electric vehicles are about control
I think why the world's governments are pushing these electric cars is so that they can turn off your car.  They make up these things about it being better for the climate but in all reality it is probably the same or worse considering most electricity is produced mostly from nonrenwlewable sources. Do you really think governments give a cap about the climate? No, they just want to control you and the best way to do that is transportation. It is a lot worse for cobalt mining which is an important part in battery manufacturing which is mostly mined by overworked kids in South Central Africa.

Proof of election fraud 2020
I‚Äôve just acquired some proof or election fraud in the 2020 election. So Trump was just brought back onto Twitter right? Last time I checked he had 83 million followers (he most likely has even more right now), so that‚Äôs 83 million people who support him, thus votes. Of course not all of them are old enough to vote, so let‚Äôs give it a margin of error of 5%, 78.85 million

Now you‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a lot of votes, but not enough to win the election right?‚Äù Well there‚Äôs also factthat not all of his voters are on twitter. The total US population is 331.9M, and the total amount of americans on twitter is 77.75M. This gives us the statistic that 25% of americans use twitter, thus 25% of trump supporters use twitter. So all of Donalds followers are only 25% of the votes he should get.

Now let‚Äôs find trumps total votes with this statistic. 78.85/.25=314.4. Did you get that 314.4 million people voted for him, that‚Äôs most of the country. He indisputably won, but the elites just had to get involved. This was the win of a lifetime and they ruined it. Do with this information as you wish
Elon Musk is pulling a Donald Trump. It almost seems like he's deliberately blowing shit up like a maniac.
Or he bought $44 Billion in code and lost the engineers who know how to keep it operating, so now it's basically worthless.

It's so bloody bizarre. I'd almost say Musk was deliberately blowing the company up if I were the suspicious type...
Taylor Red Triplets Conspiracy
Grady Smith posted a video on YouTube highlighting all the weird stuff associated w/ this group. They have more than 10 million followers on TikTok but barely any followers on YT. They seem to gain millions of followers and just one month. While they seem to be a country girl band, you will never see them seeing live. They do weird quirky videos and all of the comments are gibberish and do not make sense. Does anyone know what is going on here?
What do you think is the next black swan event
Hey guys. I wanted to ask what do you think the next black swan event is. For context the black swan theory was a theory created by a finance professor and Wall Street trader Nassim Nicholas. The theory basically goes that at any point in time something so unlikely to happen will happen, and since it did the consequences of it happening has rippling effects. A god example of a black swan event would be the 2008 housing market crash. nassim goes on to state that as the world continues to become more connected there‚Äôs more dire a black swan event become. 
I made a video covering it if u want to learn more. But I really want to know is what do u guys think the next black swan event is ?
Twitter tanking is a planned front against free speech and smaller news sources
Can't deny Twitter is a platform for sharing news from small, independent sources.  Possibly the biggest.  Billionaire news groups, Saudi Arabian and Russian governments. Any number of billion $$ companies who took in profits hand over fist contributing to world wide inflation would benefit from the public knowing less.  Many of these have relationships with Musk. 44billion isn't a lot from a group of billionaires who all share a common goal.  Chump change when put up against removing their biggest critic.  

Twitter was bought with intent to crash it to remove it as a means to share info that criticizes billionaires

Spoiling paintings has nothing to do with oil consumption or the environment
What if spoiling famous paintings, which is done by idiots in the name of saving the environment, is actually about purposeful wealth destruction of masses?

Examples: Crypto value drops to zero when things go wrong. War makes entire cities lose value (destroyed infrastructure, buildings, etc). Pension funds and stocks can vanish in the blink of an eye due to accounting errors or "unexpected" circumstances. Oil tankers and pipelines get bombed and their value reduced to nothing. 

Basically, if your wealth is not stored in the things being destroyed, you're essentially getting richer compared to others.

It's common for extremely rich people to sell their stake in things and then burn it to the ground.

Interestingly, nowadays, there are ads for fractional ownership of art, under the pretext that it outperforms most other asset classes.

So here's my conspiracy theory:

Extremely wealthy pumped up the price of art, and then are trying to sell it to the masses as fractional shares, and then destroy the art in the name of some other cause.

Is DCM in dogs really linked to grain free diets?
So high members of the FDA have been caught with stocks in food companies, especially grain producing companies, which is the reason grains have been pushed on us so much. That food pyramid is just a straight up lie. So is it possible grain companies wanted to expand to selling their products to make more money? Of course. What market could they expand into? Pet food, especially dog food. Is DCM really linked to grain free diets? Or is it being caused by something else, and the FDA is using it and faking studies linking it to grain free diets, and low and behold, we now have a reason to add grain to all the main dog food brands.
Time-traveling Hitler
You hear some crazy shit on public transport late at night, but this one takes the cake. One night heading home from a night out I heard this guy in front of me trying to sell his friend on the most insane theory I have ever heard. As always, they start off with 'Just go with me on this one man...'

"So, think about it man, what if Adolf Hitler was identified as a peak leader by a group in the far future enslaved by the jewish race, so two of these people travelled back in time and began influencing him (Hitler) from a very yong age. Over time they had to remain close, but not too close as to be identified as a member of his party, but were constantly advising and directing him in the hope that he would succeed in his ultimate plan, and in doing so, change the future"

"It was never his own idea man, he was just the puppet, but the time traveller's chose the wrong guy. He ended up being too unpredictable and that was his ultimate down fall. But what if he was actually right?"

I was dumbfounded by what I heard and have been thinking about it for weeks
But why!? https://www.ebaumsworld.com/articles/why-paul-stamets-refused-to-talk-about-portobello-mushroom/87306030/

My theory on how the Pyramids might've been built
A while back, on one psychedelic experience or other, I had like a mental "vision" about ancient Egyptians in a trance-like state, climbing up a pyramid by a scaffold that spiraled all the way up. Some were painting hieroglyphics on the pyramid, while others read already painted ones. It was all kinds of people, it didn't look like an exclusive group, not just slaves, construction workers, or artists. It was more like everyone who lived there participating in the finishing stages of the construction of the structure.

Idk if it was just my brain creating an image because I was thinking so hard about something, a past life/ancient knowledge "download", or what, but it made me think.

I read ancient Egyptians had psychedelic drugs, my theory is that the people were exposed to some kind of drug (maybe an extinct plant or something) that put them all in a state where they either were controlled by a person/group into building extravagant structures, or developed mass psychosis (or had a mass psychedelic epiphany) and had a reason to all come together and build these structures, for a cultish metaphysical purpose that was fueled by the psychedelic trips.
Twitter conspiracy and elon musks "craziness"
I personally think that regarding elon musks initial ineptitude at running twitter since he purchaed it is all part of a long plan. Musk is smart (you dont get to his wealth being stupid no matter how you feel about him personally). Elon musk is doing this not to tank twitter but to tank the current corporate headquarters in San Francisco California. I think he is going to let it go apocalyptic for a while (while both having staff leave and get fired or laid off) and when the dust settles and the staff of Twitter hq is skeletal at best he will announce he is moving the hq to either Texas or Florida (with govenors and state governments who like him more than newsome and the California state goverment) So he will have less regulations or taxes to deal with and less staff to have to offer moving allowances to. And also with the new Twitter hq he can hired all yes men who are libertarian types or objectivist weirdos (or even Maga types) who already moved to either Texas or Florida to run the whole thing (who already moved there from other tech companies who moved to either Texas or Florida) instead of more progressive bay area silicon Valley types. Just wanted to get this subs opinion on the matter
Let's Bounce an Idea
Over the course of my time paying attention and finding subtle hints from the Media, Internet, Hollyweird and theories. I've come to the idea that the Powers That Be have been using these tools to frighten most to fear the idea of going to another country. Not everyone, but a good chunk anyway.

Whether you use examples such as Taken, Hostel, Euro Trip (yes I'll even use Comedy as an example), Squid Game, Pentaverate, and the list could grow the more we think of it. But these all show people from America go to another country for the sake of fun, adventure and vacation. Only for them to be absorbed into whatever messed up ideals these groups have in these other countries.

Now, I'm not saying these things don't happen here. They do, and I'm not dismissing them. But fear is a tool that is used to control large groups. Why is it so hard for a person to move to America, but can be even MORE tedious to try and move out to another country. Not only from prejudices in place due to how our country is viewed, but also how we have been raised and indoctrinated to believe as well.

Racism isn't bred into a person's mind, it's taught. Fear is something someone can overcome, but not something those in charge want you to do.

Just a thought and a little highdea I had recently
Whenever Forbes or Wired or those big youtube channels upload‚Ä¶
videos guest starring the CIA or military or whatever; it‚Äôs not an random.

If they show you ‚Äúhow to infiltrate a base‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat gadgets we use‚Äù it‚Äôs because they have new ideas. They want enemies to watch it so they are underprepared for what they actually use.
The shady business around Taylor Swift and Ticketmaster
I have absolutely no horse in the race of getting Taylor Swift‚Äôs tickets, but I do despise ticketmaster. They are a monopoly and I think they conveniently crashed at the time of a high demand to capitalize. 


Absolutely sucks, because I personally know a lot of people that are/ were stoked. And although I don‚Äôt relate to the want or need to go, I have definitely seen bands that meant a great deal to me. 


TL;DR Ticketmaster is shady.
Is it time we try a resource based economy and how do we proceed?

Brady and Gisele‚Äôs separation and divorce happened so quickly to protect assets and money from lawsuits
I was kinda expecting to hear when the news broke that Brady and Gisele were having problems because he came back for one more year but then was shocked when they confirmed the divorce was finalized and over within weeks.

I started thinking that Brady had every intention of retiring but was told the truth of FTX and he had to come back to do another season as cover for needing to get divorced to save some of their assets  by getting him removed from ownership if he were to be sued.

Individualism is a fake philosophy created by rich people and corporations to avoid taxes
Title says it all. 

The rich and corporations spend a lot of money convincing the working class that their relative poverty is their fault, their political oppression is their fault, climate change is their fault and their responsibility to solve, etc etc etc. 

They do this because the rich and corporations don't want to pay higher taxes to pay for services like healthcare, public transport, or higher welfare; nor submit to regulations limiting their pollution of the environment; nor have their workers unionise and start demanding to be treated better. If all those things are \*your\* responsibility to solve, everything works in the favour of the rich and corporations. Class solidarity is what they fear the most. All the time we are divided and thinking of ourselves as individuals is all the time we are powerless to stop their exploitation of us. 

That is why they pay people like Jordan Peterson to convince young men that they need to "clean their own room" rather than question why their company is making record profits and they haven't had a pay rise in 5 years. That is why the "personal carbon footprint" was invented to shift the blame off of corporations for climate change and onto you the consumer. That is why the US has terrible public transport because politicians favour forcing people to buy expensive cars and gas and insurance rather than raise taxes on themselves to pay for the infrastructure. 

Individualism is a lie. Stop whatever you are doing and take a look around you. How much stuff within arms reach was made by someone else, invented decades ago by someone else, using scientific discoveries made by someone else, made by materials made by someone else, in a factory built by someone else, using building plans made by someone else, printed on paper made by someone else... and on it goes. The idea that we are individuals who are in control of our place in the world is nonsense. We a clearly part of a massive hive that relies on an uncountable amount of other people's contributions to support. Other people whom it is in our personal interest to make sure are supported. 

Similarly the idea that "individual decisions and actions" is the reason why someone born in the projects with diabetes to a broken home faces an insurmountable series of obstacles in order to become POTUS, is obviously nonsense. Our lives are completely shaped by our environment, as all life has been since it began according to Darwin. 

Individualism is just how the rich and corporations saddle working people with all the blame, all the responsibility, and all of the financial burden.

"Under the rule of the integrated spectacle, we live and die at the confluence of innumerable mysteries." - Guy Debord, Comments on the Society of the Spectacle
>We have long been accustomed to summary executions of all kinds of people. Known terrorists, or those considered as such, are openly fought with terrorist methods. Mossad can arrange the killing of Abou Jihad, the SAS can do the same with Irish people, and the parallel police of GAL with Basques. Those whose killings are arranged by supposed terrorists are not chosen without reason; but it is generally impossible to be sure of understanding these reasons. One can be aware that Bologna railway station was blown up to ensure that Italy continued to be well governed; or of the identity of the 'death squads' in Brazil; or that the Mafia can bum down a hotel in the United States to facilitate a racket. But how can we know what purpose was ultimately served by the 'mad killers of Brabant'? It is hard to apply the principle *Cui prodest?* where so many active interests are so well concealed. The result is that under the rule of the integrated spectacle, we live and die at the confluence of innumerable mysteries.

Why is conservative media trying to kill its audience?
It's no secret that antivax beliefs correlate with right wing politics. Opposition vaccines on the ground that they are dangerous has been pushed by conservative media since the first COVID vaccines were available, as was opposition to other pandemic safety measures like mask wearing. 

Just a couple of days ago Tucker Carlson was misrepresenting a study of the Chinese (non-mRNA) vaccine on his show with the obvious message that the vaccines are dangerous. 

What this lying about vaccines has resulted in, is far more registered Republicans dying from COVID when compared to registered Democrats.

[https://www.nber.org/system/files/working\_papers/w30512/w30512.pdf](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30512/w30512.pdf)

The death rate for Republicans is **76%** higher, and this difference only began to show after the vaccine was widely available. 

There is even speculation that this may have been enough to swing the midterm elections in the Democrat's favour. 

So why are they doing this? What is their angle? The people at Fox News aren't stupid, they know the vaccines are safe and effective, which is why they mandated their staff take it. So what are they trying to do? Why are they killing their audience? Why are they killing their voters?
China is taking over western countries, but instead of diplomacy or military force, they are doing social engineering
Obviously china and the United States are always one uping each other. But I think china is purposely taking a different route and controlling the American people. Let me explain.

My first case is Tik tok. It‚Äôs proven TikTok can be easily addictive and a dopamine playground and millions are already addicted. TikTok is a Chinese company and they constantly try to cater to western audiences. It‚Äôs funny though that In china TikTok is heavily monitored and there are time limits set in place, where you can only use TikTok for X amount of time per day.

My second case (which I admit is more Anecdotal and no hard evidence) is Reddit and tencent. I swear to god, I‚Äôve seen a rise in censorship especially in political discussions (and subreddits that never where meant to be political, turn into political circle jerks).  And don‚Äôt forget tencent is the Chinese government right hand man in terms of censoring information

What do you guys think?
Could we all be the same person?
The only thing we can be certain of as far as consciousness is that "I think, therfor I am." Very old philosophical concept and ideology that has been a basic fundamental understanding of our reality. 

So extending that, I can't confirm that you are conscious, but I know that I am experiencing.. something. 

But what if there really is just one consciousness and we are subjectively experiencing ourselves through every souls eyes?

I heard a theory of one particle that is vibrating at a frequency that allows it to be everything, everywhere, all at once- past, present, and future. 

So if we look at this as a biological computer program (basically what quantum physics is), then the simulation likely can only experience one life at a time. So I could essentially live my entire life... could live literal trillions of lives from millions of years in the future to thousands in the past before our collective consciousness finally enters your body before you live your entire life before reading these words at this exact moment in time. 

Want to know something crazy? I was an atheist for most of my life. But the more I study the natural world and start to recognize the balance, the patterns, the the energy, the things you can feel like bad things before they happen.. and you start to see little breaks in the matrix when you understand hoe predictable people are and how there seems to be like NPCs everywhere.. and the more that I see that stuff it makes me think that this is designed.. like there's no way this isn't by design. And then okay suddenly I'm not an atheist and I find myself thinking intelligent design is not only possible...but likely. 

So that begs the questions then- who designed it? 

And the more I ask that question the more I realize that the questions aren't what's important, it's the experience. 

Maybe Deja vu and other feelings of that nature are just remnants or pieces of memory burned into your soul. Maybe reincarnation is just you being loaded back into the program. 

I think that they know the answers- the "suits." They know. 
Ately it feels as if the matrix was cracking. I started to theorize that maybe something is wrong with our sun. That's why the economy's are crashing and elites are sending money to the tip top of the 1%  it's why the world seems to have gone mad. 

Idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I'm just throwing darts. I've heard so many credible theories that make me wonder, so hard to know which information is truthful and based on facts of reality.

Jay Z is illiterate
He never writes anything down. Have you ever seen him read anything? Does he strike you as a person who could read?
Is knowledge/information a sort of different dimension?
I know it does sound dumb at first sight and it might be as well. Was just staring blank into nothing when I got this thought and wrote it down.

Is there anything like a dimension of knowledge or information. Those creatures, of whom we are currently unaware of, might know the unpredictably of the current human world (are made up of an extra dimension), and might have the ability to change it which we have utterly failed. Who knows what we consider as black swans might be them controlling our existence. 

They are not exactly "creatures" but maybe something present in a different dimension which controls everything we cant. For eg. we cant predict the path of a double pendulum at all at large disturbances. It seems vague but we know some information is missing, and that inormation might be in some hidden dimension, having a ripple effect in its motion in a way that we can never ever prepare the equations of motions for it unless we acknowledge it and device a whole new theory regarding it. What if the butterfly effect is the consequence of this same phenomenon?

I might be bashed but these are just my night thoughts I wrote down a few months ago. Just a point of view! Also would love to hear out flaws or counterarguments against it!
CERN statement about ‚Äúaccidentally sucking the earth into a black hole‚Äù.
Does anybody have the article from when CERN admitted to accidentally sucking the earth into a black hole? I was talking with some friends tonight & was telling them about how I read an article about 5 or 6 months ago where CERN admitted to accidentally sucking earth into a black hole. Went to go look for the article again and now I cannot find it!!?? Wondering if anybody has it or has the link?! Ty in advance.
Was the universe created in a lab?
Wat if CERN is nothing but a time machine? But not a time machine in the sense you're thinking where people can go back... but hear me out on this. 

So what do they do at CERN? It's a particle collider, so they collide particles- duh. But let's examine what that means and what they're doing. 

What they are doing is smashing particles at close to lights peed, at one another. We know that when you approach light speed that time acts funny. So what of they figured out how to send Data back in time at the moment of these particles colliding, but sending information encoded in the particles. Idk about you but I first heard of particle colliders in this millennium but they have been around for over 100 years. 

Could be why Mandela effects have been happening, people are messing with our timeline in very simple ways that's have odd ripple effects.

The reason the small size for McDonald's French Fries comes in a different container than the others.
So some people here may have noticed that when you order French Fries at McDonald's in the small size, at least in the U.S., they come in a little white bag instead of a red cardboard container (or I just eat at McDonald's way too much). This wouldn't be that weird if it was just the medium and large that came in cardboard containers, but even the tiny happy meal sized fries come in a red cardboard container like the medium and large fries do. So you may be thinking, what the heck? What's the deal with these fry containers?

Well I'm here to tell you the deal. They're ripping us all off, big time. The difference in the amount of fries you get between the medium and small size is extremely small, but this would be obvious if the small size came in a cardboard container like the medium and large, so they put it in a bag.

Now you may be thinking, why the small size? Why not have the bag be fore the medium or large size? I'll tell you why, it's because that looks the least suspicious. Using a bag for the medium size would look weird, and using a bag for the large size would be a lot messier than using a cardboard container. 

Also, normally only young kids get happy meals, and they're not likely to think about this. Adults don't usually order happy meals so won't really end up noticing or thinking about it either, since they won't be the ones eating the happy meal fries, or at least that's what McDonald's thinks. But I can tell you that I have ordered plenty of happy meals, and other various fry sizes at McDonald's, and every single time has been the same for every fry size. 

This is a disgrace to our society, the American people deserve better than this. McDonald's may think they have us fooled, but they should think again! SOME of us actually pay attention to what's going on and have knowledge of our society's real issues, and we should not let this information go unknown any longer! McDonald's, start being honest about the difference between the amount of fries in your fry sizes or we will expose it ourselves!
JustStopOil is a government organisation to make the world hate protesters thus they can sneakily nan protesting.
Edit: Ban** not Nan üëµ 

My reasoning behind such claims:

They‚Äôve been active on the m25 for most of the week. They tweeted today stating they won‚Äôt be protesting above the m25 over the weekend. The weekend that ALOT of people have off as most people work Monday to Friday. On the weekends, people spend money, they go out to eat, shop etc. Pump money back into the economy. The government brought ‚Äúeat out to help out‚Äù and pushed for us to do this, then locked us down and blamed us? Convenient how they don‚Äôt wonna protest it over weekends where people spend spend spend. 

In the grand scheme of it, loads of us are hating these protesters, me included. A lot of people over social media who hate them will without hesitation say ‚Äúlock them up as soon as you see them, stops them from doing these protests‚Äù‚Ä¶ which yes, cos they‚Äôre very annoying and I want to go about my day. But what a lot of people aren‚Äôt realising is that the government are itching to ban protesting. Protesting is such an essential thing and people aren‚Äôt seeing that when it‚Äôs protesters like these who are just downright annoying and inconvenient for, let‚Äôs face it, practically no reason other than to ‚Äúget attention‚Äù. The government can‚Äôt fund these other companies on strike and the only way to get round that is to ban protesting, so they‚Äôre deliberately causing havoc with just oil. (You don‚Äôt see insane coverage of Royal Mail strikes or TFL strikes?) because they KNOW the people are hating these activists and being lured down the path of ‚Äúbring laws in‚Äù

A lot of places and companies go on strike for REAL reasons such as TFL, Royal Mail and the imminent striking of the NHS, mainly due to poor funding, especially on the NHS‚Äôs part. If the government end up getting what they want and are PLANNING for, which is a ban on protesting, these above won‚Äôt be able to strike. You‚Äôll have a rubbish Royal Mail service which is currently being stripped to bits, TFL lines will be understaffed and so will the NHS because people will refuse to work for it. We all know what‚Äôs in store if the NHS start to lose more staff‚Ä¶ delayed diagnoses for cancers and diseases and heck of a lot more deaths. 

Trust me, we don‚Äôt want a ban on protesting.
Elon Musk is a Russian asset purposefully trying to crash twitter into bankruptcy
Think about it Musk has talked directly to Putin on several occasions. He wants Ukraine to roll over and let Russia win, tweets about getting Teslas to be sold there, and now is purposefully tanking twitter as a way to help cripple one of the worlds biggest social media sites. That and millions of people use twitter to follow official government and other verified accounts in order to stay up to date. 

If he is actually working for Putin then it makes sense as a covert public operation to undermine freedom of communications.
Even till now
The elite still oppress the latin Americans and the black Americans. I conspire they don't want certain ethnicities to get ahead so they leave the hood and project decrepit and conspire with banks to block these ethnicities from getting out of the hood by denying them loans for mortgage or businesses. Purposefully making counties underfund the schools within those communities to make sure the oppressed never received a proper education.

Anyone who tries to assist these oppressed people by building real estate in their communities is dealt with. 

I often wondered why the super rich don't buy land in these communities and 3d print homes on those land and provide affordable real housing. 3d printing is known to cut cost by 50% which can translate to cheaper real estate for these oppressed. Owning a home is a key to getting out of poverty.

A 500,000 home in the better part of town is now 250,000 and so forth.

Such a wicked government. They oppress these people by not landscaping their properties and cutting off their power at most important times and by taking jobs out the projects/ hood. How a wicked government. They also make getting proper licensing permits to build in those communities near impossible. They just want to oppress blacks and latinas.

You keep shouting we are equal. My boy we never been equal.

The ‚ÄòJust Stop Oil‚Äô protest
Big oil fund the Just Stop Oil events. Big oil also fund
and have close ties with the Tory party (hence no
windfall tax). They are creating major disruption in
order to introduce draconian laws on protesting. Why is
this not the debate? Their methods don't even aligned
with people who genuinely care about stopping oil, they
accept donations in crypto, littering their glue packets
into gutters, and their largest donor is an oil
heiress(Eileen Getty). None of these things align with
people who would stick themselves to a road with
superglue to force more action on climate change.
These people know that they will stay for the press
photos, and then be released in the morning.They are
using your human reaction to outrage against you, to
get these bills passed. We're helping them by buying
into the hysteria. There will soon come a time where we
need your rights to protest about important things(cost
of living), but will have wished it away on this fake
nonsense, we're playing right into their hands. They
create the problemthat wouldn't be there without their
influence, then use public outrage about the problem in
order to push through what they really wanted all along,
which is to eliminate our right to protest. It's sad to
think that this is the point of corruption we're at with
our government, but this is how ruthlessly they operate.
They use the 'order out of chaos' method. They want
us to argue amongst each other and have surface level
debates, it suits them, it helps them reach their true
end goal, to disarm us of our right to protest.
Communism vs Capitalism
I'm currently in my Chicano studies class and we're talking about Marxism. And it led me to wonder, a lot of minority countries shift to communism or struggle against capitalism but a lot of white countries stick with Capitalism.

Things to consider

-Capitalist countries have a class system. The rich, elite, benefit the most from this system while leaving the poor feeling oppressed.

- One of the "roots of racism" is the notion that you keep the working class separated by fighting about race thats way they wont ban together against the elite/rich

-Marxism on paper states that wealth and resources be evenly distributed to everyone. The idea seems to be that a village takes care of each other. But at a much larger scale.

JFK was killed by the central bank
John F Kennedy was killed in November of 1963 by Oswald. A lot of people think the Russians are behind this but I think there was another factor the central bank. You see under JFK the central bank almost lost all of its power and to retain that I bet they had to kill him
Smartphones and laptops stopped evolving significantly 5-6 years ago.
Meanwhile brands keep filling older smartphones with updates so you think you lack memory (20gb on android 9.0 ??)...new smartphones from lower tier are even worse than a mid tier 5 year old smartphone... mid tier cameras still have bad quality software-induced... so you have to pay always full price for a smartphone that works good.

Laptops same shit. My laptop was less than 400 euros 6 years ago. It has 256GB SSD. Quadcore AMD and 8GB from factory... for the same price, i get exactly the same shit nowadays.

Technology has stopped evolving, we should be buying these "new" smartphones and laptops for 50 bucks, not 500. Brands and marketeers are spoofing everyone.

All we get in stores is old techstock rebranded as new with a hugely inflated price.

Scary thought that economic stagnation triggers a plague response.
I was reviewing the economics of Europe from like 1000AD on and when reading about crop (thus economic) stagnation after a few hundred years of continuous growth, the plague entered the scene. A ton of folks perished, wages went up for some, and some got out of serfdom. But not all, there continued to be peasant uprisings until the death evened things out. And it just sounded familiar with the impact of WW1, the spanish flu, and WW2, and now. Maybe it‚Äôs nothing and I‚Äôm recognizing a pattern that doesn‚Äôt exist. Thoughts???

Internet
It has become a curated disaster. Corporations have control over the information we see and we play a major part in what they show us. Motivated not by wanting control over our minds but active engagement to generate wealth. Which in turn naturally becomes influence. Us as a populace generating influence for the Corporations which use that wealth and influence in a attempt to appease their target audience. Which just so happens to be whatever group gives more money to that corporation. No clear line can be drawn to stop this unintentionally self imposed inception on the human species hive mind. There seems to be no way to derail this monumental social disaster we collectively have mandated. Our own downfall will and has always been  our animal nature guiding us. As a group species we are powerless to stop it. Like a dog chasing a ball or defending its plate of food. A dog does not recognize its nature. The tragedy of mankind is that some of us see the threads that pull us but the group does not listen. Does not head the warning of individuals. Just like a dog chasing a ball.

True Crime
Has anyone ever thought about how some shows like dateline or forensic files could be part of cover ups? Maybe not directly and definitely not every episode. But I've noticed some datelines leave out very important information that would shed innocent light on the person of interest. Forensic files has ignored forensic evidence and not even mentioned other persons of interest in some episodes. And there's one episode in particular where the guy insists he's innocent but the episode is 20 minutes long and it hardly focuses on any forensic evidence and is just trying to to convince us with circumstantial evidence that he's guilty. To just accept it. We know people get framed by the government and cops during human trafficking operations and more. So what if these shows get paid to make it look like the person they want to be guilty is? How many people question true crime shows bias and intent? Not many. Opinions? Or anything to add?

Social media conspiracy theory ‚Ä¶
So, this is something I just thought of. I have no proof to back it. 

It‚Äôs true that TikTok is a Chinese company and it is harvesting data of Americans. But all the other social media companies here in the US ‚ÄîFacebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snap ‚Äî they have done that for a long time. Facebook interfered with elections all over the world and worse. This year, Apple finally asked people if they wanted to give their data away. Only 16% agreed and businesses are no longer gathering as much of that sweet, sweet data. Scott Galloway said it tanked all the technology companies, leading to massive layoffs. 

Now, back to TikTok. Currently, TikTok is the most used social media in the world vastly outdoing all other platforms, especially in advertising. 

The US government is now talking about banning TikTok, which I understand from a national security point. 

But thinking about all the things that have happened this week, is it possible that the government wants to crush the  competition with TikTok to appease big tech and then force American businesses into buying ads on the other platforms? 

I deleted my TikTok a while ago, but I still think ‚Ä¶ it all smells really fishy, even if data mining from China is happening. I‚Äôve deactivated Twitter, FB, and Insta. Now, Reddit is my only social media account.

Russian-linked disinformation is targeting far-right voters: Report

Don't get vril droned
Many think that celebrities and public figures cover their eye to represent the all seeing eye. This is misinformation. 

It's to indicate not to be vril droned or cloned. The process is when the vril enters the eye, the person loses their soul. Much like parasite, it takes over the whole body and the person is virtually dead. Controlled by the vril consciousness, the person isn't a person. 

In addition, cloning factories clone the person, but if anything happens to the clone such as a blow to the leg, the person who was cloned will feel the pain. Sometimes originals are killed, sometimes controlled via threats to what they'll do with the clone if you disobey orders. 

Unfortunately, this sounds pretty crazy and it is, but this is a real occurrence.

I have this theory about why we are always asked to vote.
I‚Äôve always wondered why we were always pushed to vote, even though we know (and they know) voting doesn‚Äôt really have power. Of course you can go the easy way and say it‚Äôs a good measurement for whatever group is actually controlling the world to see who is actually sheep (and/or still believes we have just enough power to change the world - how ever you wanna put it). Although this does make some sense, I think it goes a bit deeper.

Now we all know that a figure head is chosen based on what is needed for that country (examples could be acting, hope, or just pure puppetry). Planning just what a country needs to believe has to be a delicate job, some rich assholes that sit at the top of their riches all day wouldn‚Äôt be bothered. There has to be a team hired by them. A team perfectly picked out to balance the numbers as much as they can in the leaders favor. Of course, they would be paid handsomely for this, and that may not be in money.

I‚Äôm an optimist, and I like to believe there is good hidden in even the darkest places of this shithole of a world. I believe that some people who made it to that delicately balanced team are good and are really trying to make a change, but rich assholes only believe numbers. So, if you have the right numbers, and say the right words, you can get things moving in a direction you want it to go. Meaning, we get speeches about voting and ‚Äòmaking ourselves heard‚Äô because it‚Äôs the only way they can make the changes they want to make.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this can totally go in the opposite way and be used for ‚Äòevil‚Äô or it can just be part of the VERY delicate equation that keeps a rich asshole in power.

But that‚Äôs just my theory, what are your thoughts?

Suspect accused of politically motivated attack on Paul Pelosi was 'completely caught up in the fantasy, in the MAGA fantasy,' his boss says

[By Sean Casteel, Diane Tessman has been involved with the UFO mystery since she was four years old. At that young age she had two encounters, about six months apart, with a human-like being called ‚ÄúTibus.‚Äù From that time onward, she has felt a ‚Äúshared consciousness‚Äù with Tibus which is similar to telepathy. With Tibus‚Äô input, Diane has offered psychic insight and spiritual counseling to thousands of people who also feel contact from ‚Äúbeings from beyond.‚Äù The experience can be frightening at times and joyous at other times. Diane‚Äôs guidance has proved helpful and healing. She maintains two publications, Change Times Quarterly, and Star Network Heartline for star seeds, experiencers, and seekers., Diane would eventually become a field investigator with both the Mutual UFO Network, a worldwide civilian organization dedicated to finding the truth about UFOs and aliens, and the legendary Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization (APRO) which developed information and research on UFOs and UAPs which continue to be highly respected., Today, Diane is Director of the Star Network Cat Sanctuary and Wildlife Refuge as well as offering readings and counseling to people hoping for emotional healing and providing personal insight for those seeking to solve the mysteries around them. Diane has never stopped investigating and researching in a scientific manner but, amazingly, her spirit guide Tibus has continued to have input into her scientific efforts as well. Science and Spirit are the two sides of the whole ‚Äúcoin‚Äù of reality., In her new book, Beings From Beyond: They Are Here, Diane shares what she has discovered regarding the UFO/UAP phenomenon and what beings are really behind it. She has experienced paranormal events all her life and offers amazing new information as to what The Paranormal really is and how it fits in with the UFO phenomenon. After all, very often if someone has a UFO experience, they are also visited by paranormal happenings. Diane shares her own experiences in this regard in this new book., The book opens with this dramatic declaration: ‚ÄúHere is my hypothesis: UFOs and UAPs are from a level of existence beyond ours. This in itself is the answer to many aspects of the UFO/UAP puzzle., ‚ÄúA new level of existence will become a necessity,‚Äù Diane continues, ‚Äúan evolutionary mandate, as our advanced science technology opens ‚Äòplaces beyond belief,‚Äô as Neil Armstrong exclaimed. For instance, the creation of wormholes and the warping of time and space will expose astronauts to exotic energies and levels of reality for which our brains are not built. The filters of our minds limit us.‚Äù, Is it possible that our level of technological achievement will exceed the limits to which we have evolved as a species? Are we in effect leaving ourselves behind?, But there is something higher than us already at play here, according to Diane., ‚ÄúThe Level Beyond,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúis a combination of time travelers, extraterrestrials, and possibly other-dimensional beings. What unites them is not their specific origin but their level of existence. Their craft may vary, but they all share factthat they are from a level of existence beyond 20th and 21st century Earth.‚Äù, Diane draws on the work of Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who in 1964 presented fellow scientists with what is now called the Kardashev Scale, a ranking of civilizations in the universe that runs from Type One through Type Five. Earth at present is at the 0.7 Level of Civilization on the Kardashev Scale. Well-known physicist Dr. Michio Kaku estimates that Earth will attain to Level One in perhaps 100 to 200 years., Normally, when a ‚Äúhigher level‚Äù is referred to, the assumption is that it involves metaphysical or spiritual beliefs. But such is not necessarily the case, according to Diane., ‚ÄúThe Level Beyond,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúwhich I am hypothesizing as the source of most UFOs and UAPs, is not about any religious or spiritual belief, not about reaching Godhead, ‚ÄòThe All That Is,‚Äô or Nirvana. This is an advanced level of existence based in science and technology; there are probably good, bad and in between groups and individuals in terms of moral integrity to be found there, but that is just my opinion.‚Äù, The forces that drove this higher evolution may have been the circumstances created by technological advances, advances that demanded a shift in both consciousness and physical form. Perhaps the same is happening to us., ‚ÄúWe have been evolving toward this level for many years,‚Äù Diane writes, ‚Äúbecause evolution is always at work. Some humans have interiorized this upgrade of civilization more than others. Human entanglement with computers and high tech is part of our reaching for a higher ‚Äòaltered‚Äô level. Also, the enduring love of millions of people for ‚ÄòStar Trek,‚Äô ‚ÄòStar Wars,‚Äô and other science fiction is a part of our evolution. This is also true for those who are involved with UFO truth who hope that UFO Disclosure happens soon, so that everyone on the planet will know for sure that we are not alone.‚Äù, Beings From Beyond explains that we are not the end of the Human Family. There will be new species of humans, just as Neanderthals and other humans existed in the past. We are only in the middle of the human journey and we will keep changing ‚Äì unless we destroy ourselves., Diane believes that we must keep reaching for the Level Beyond in order to survive as a species and to cope with future scientific advances like time travel and traversing interstellar space., ‚ÄúPerhaps it is simply time,‚Äù she continues, ‚Äúto leave the comfort of Earth and make an evolutionary step upward and outward, which involves strange new worlds and consciousness. It may be entirely natural.‚Äù, Beings From Beyond: They Are Here also includes a chapter that examines the Kardashev Scale in more detail, as well as chapters devoted to the phenomena of bizarre thought-forms called ‚ÄúTulpas,‚Äù time travel, UFO occupants as visitors from our future and much more. Will the evolution of humankind keep pace with our technological advances in these troubled times?, [Beings From Beyond: They Are Here is published by Warped Space Press and is available at Amazon.com], Diane will send you a free sample newsletter online, just contact her via email: dianetessman0@gmail.com, Suggested Reading:, BEINGS FROM BEYOND: They Are Here, UFO AGENDA: So You Want to Know the Truth?, CHANGES, Predictions for a Changing, Troubled World, By Sean Casteel, In the more than 70 years since pilot Kenneth Arnold first sighted a strange formation of nine shiny airborne objects near Mount Rainier in Washington State, usually cited as the beginning of the modern UFO era, skeptics have relentlessly claimed that no ‚Äúhard evidence‚Äù for the UFO phenomenon has ever been produced. Sightings, they claim, tend to happen in backwoods swamps where no credible witnesses are present and no reliable photos are taken. How can you prove the existence of something with only thin air with which to argue your case?, But a new book from the recently formed publishing imprint Zontar Press dares to differ. The long overdue tome is called ‚ÄúAlien Artifacts: Incredible Evidence of Exotic Material from UFO Encounters.‚Äù Drawing on the contributions of more than ten topnotch researchers, work on the book began some months before the untimely passing of publisher, editor and author Timothy Green Beckley, to whom the completed work is fondly dedicated., WHAT ARE ALIEN ARTIFACTS?, Beckley‚Äôs initial concept was deceptively simple: We know that throughout the last several decades, UFOs have landed or crashed, their occupants have made contact with human experiencers, and the visiting strangers have at times left behind materials of various kinds that defy analysis. Why not gather together stories and legends about that aspect of the UFO phenomenon into a single volume that provides an overview of some of the most compelling of such incidents?, In his introduction, publisher and writer Tim R. Swartz explains the idea this way:, ‚ÄúWe have named it ‚ÄòAlien Artifacts,‚Äô‚Äù Swartz writes, ‚Äúbut actually we are using this term not so much to say that we believe that we have recovered things from ‚Äòextraterrestrial spaceships,‚Äô but because what we are discussing in this book is ‚Äòalien‚Äô as they don‚Äôt appear to have a ‚Äònormal‚Äô explanation for their origins. On top of that, we are also going beyond the strange bits of metal that have surfaced following UFO encounters. An ‚Äòalien artifact‚Äô can be a lot of different things, and we want to open your eyes to that fact.‚Äù ¬†, AN ALIEN BREAKFAST TREAT, As an example, Swartz tells the story of Wisconsin farmer Joe Simonton, who was shocked to see a metallic UFO land outside his house. He rushed outside and saw a hatch opening from the craft, looking ‚Äújust like the trunk of your car.‚Äù Inside were three ‚Äúlittle men‚Äù about five feet tall and wearing dark turtleneck shirts and helmets. One of the creatures held up a metallic jug, gesturing that he would like to have it filled up with water. Simonton filled up the jug and returned it to the little man., Simonton looked inside the ship and saw another little man cooking ‚Äúpancakes‚Äù on a smooth, square, grill-like surface. Hoping to start a conversation, the farmer gestured that he would like to try the food. The man handed him four of the pancakes, which Simonton said were ‚Äúhot and greasy.‚Äù Out of politeness, Simonton tried one of the pancakes, which he said tasted like cardboard. The food was so unappetizing that he speculated it might account for the creatures‚Äô diminutive size., The pilot then indicated that Simonton should step back and closed the hatch. The craft rose up vertically, ‚Äúlike an elevator,‚Äù shot off into the sky and quickly disappeared., Swartz goes on to write that, unlike thousands of other UFO reports, this one came with actual physical evidence in the form of strange, bubbly textured pancakes. After the story got out, the Air Force sent their top UFO investigator, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, to look into the case. According to Hynek, there was no doubt the Simonton felt his encounter was a real experience. The Air Force had the pancake sample tested and found they were ordinary ‚Äúbuckwheat pancakes‚Äù consisting of fat, starch, buckwheat hulls and soybean hulls. In spite of the earthly origin of the pancakes, the Air Force labeled the case as ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlien Artifacts‚Äù includes a photo of Simonton holding one of the pancakes., ANCIENT SCALE MODEL AIRCRAFT, I contribute a chapter called ‚ÄúThe Alien Glittering of True Gold‚Äù in which I discuss works of art created by the Quimbaya, natives of Columbia, South America, who were believed to inhabit the region from 300 to 1550 CE and are best known for their precise gold and metal work. Most of the Quimbaya pieces discovered by archeologists were an alloy of gold and 30 percent copper, called ‚Äútumbaga,‚Äù and very similar to a metal mentioned by Plato in his dialogues about the Lost City of Atlantis. The objects included golden models of several types of insects along with devices that are aerodynamic in nature and shaped like no insect known to exist., Some of the ancient pieces look very much like the designs of modern airplanes and incorporate a number of features that essentially prove that the Quimbaya knew and understood principles of flight. Some of the models include tail rudders and propellers. The existence of so many similarities to modern-day airplanes supports the ‚ÄúOut-of-Place-Artifact‚Äù theory: they seem too advanced for the Quimbaya., It has been theorized for years that some of the Quimbaya objects are scale models of airplanes or flying machines. Two aeronautical engineers, Peter Belting and Conrad Lubbers, used the dimensions of the Quimbaya artifacts to create large-scale models which proved successful in flight testing. They proved that the designs fly with both simple single-propeller power and jet power. It‚Äôs more than just a coincidence that the artifacts can be scaled up and actually fly., There is another intriguing phenomenon at play here, which happens after a remote culture is visited for the first time with technology present. Isolated tribes visited in both Africa and South America by airplanes have demonstrated shifts in religious beliefs after the visit. One of the tribes welcomed the plane on its second visit with ceremonial fire and statues constructed in the shape of the airplane. Tribal people even went so far as to line themselves along a runway to greet the visitors., If remote cultures exhibit this sort of behavior during the world‚Äôs modern technological era, then likely the same concept has played out before. From this angle of thinking, theories then suggest that the Quimbaya may have been influenced by another ancient culture, or, perhaps, some sort of alien civilization. ¬†, THE ENCOUNTERS OF JOHN LENNON, The artifacts phenomenon also has connections to not just remote and ancient cultures but to current day pop culture as well. In a chapter by Nigel Watson, called ‚ÄúJohn Lennon‚Äôs Egg,‚Äù the story is told of how the aliens gifted a metallic egg to the late lamented Beatle and solo artist rocker., Lennon announced he had seen a UFO on the sleeve of his ‚ÄúWalls and Bridges‚Äù album, writing on the back cover: ‚ÄúOn 23 August 1974, I saw a UFO. J.L.‚Äù, Lennon was estranged from Yoko Ono at the time and was living with girlfriend May Pang in a New York apartment. It was a hot night and May was taking a shower when Lennon called to her from the terrace, where she found him naked and pointing at a strange object in the sky., May said it looked like a large flattened cone with a bright red light on top of it at a distance of only 100 feet away. As the object came closer, it revealed a dazzling row of flashing white lights along its rim. The couple made an unsuccessful attempt to photograph the object before it moved off out of sight. The UFO returned a bit later and, although they were prepared this time with a telescope, the object was too bright to discern any further details., On another occasion, Lennon was in bed with Yoko when he awakened suddenly to see a powerful searchlight shining outside the bedroom door. On opening the door, he found four thin, human-sized bug-like entities whom he attempted to force out of his home. But before he could even touch them, some invisible form of power held him back. They gently held his hands and pushed his legs into a tunnel of light where he was shown an ‚Äúoutstandingly beautiful‚Äù movie of his life. Then his mind went blank and he woke to find himself lying in bed with Yoko again., Lennon was sure he had not been tripping or dreaming. As evidence of this encounter he found an egg-like metallic object in his hands when he woke up next to Yoko. The solid object with no markings was too weird even for Lennon. He speculated that it was a ticket to an alien planet but he was quite happy with New York.¬† ¬†, He gave the egg to psychic spoon-bender Uri Geller, who has kept it ever since. Geller would later say, ‚ÄúWhen I hold the cold metal egg in my fist, I have a strong sensation that John knew more about this object than he told me. Maybe it didn‚Äôt come with an instruction manual, but I think John knew what it was for.‚Äù Geller said he has never submitted the egg for scientific analysis because he wants to maintain its ‚Äúmysticism.‚Äù, GOING HAND-IN-GLOVE, Before he died in 2021, Timothy Green Beckley had been in the UFO game for 60 years and it was hard to impress him with anyone claiming to have the ‚Äúreal thing,‚Äù or concrete proof that aliens had visited Earth and left behind artifacts that irrefutably demonstrated that reality., In an interview Beckley conducted, along with his cohost Tim R. Swartz, on their podcast ‚ÄúExploring the Bizarre,‚Äù one of the rarest examples of just such an artifact was the subject of their conversation with John Peele, a health food restauranteur and long distance runner, whose story was spine-tingling in the extreme., ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very strange and odd case,‚Äù Beckley began. ‚ÄúOne of the most peculiar I‚Äôve been involved in. It includes meeting Mr. John Peele in late 1978 or early 1979 in Florida. At the time, he owned a health food store and restaurant and had a very unusual artifact that he had located while running across the Arizona desert. It is one of the few alien artifacts that we can actually point to as existing., ‚ÄúWe hear about the Roswell UFO crash,‚Äù Beckley continued, ‚Äúand deceased alien bodies strewn across the desert, but there‚Äôs very little proof ‚Äì Roswell fanatics will go for the jugular on this one ‚Äì there is very little proof that any of that took place.‚Äù, Beckley was editing ‚ÄúUFO Review,‚Äù a tabloid newspaper focused on the titular phenomenon, and had published a small number of books, when he first met Peele while on a promotional tour and fact-finding mission in Florida. Along the way, Beckley got Peele‚Äôs phone number and Peele invited him to visit his home., BECKLEY SEES THE ARTIFACT, ‚ÄúHe showed me this ‚Äì well, I call it an alien artifact ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know what else you would call it ‚Äì and it took my breath away,‚Äù Beckley recalled. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been nothing like this before.‚Äù, Beckley said he has discussed the find with several people and has been greeted on occasion by total disbelief. Where is the artifact? Where is the witness? Decades later, Beckley found Peele on Facebook and invited him to appear on ‚ÄúExploring the Bizarre.‚Äù, Peele found the artifact in 1977, while on a long-distance run from Daytona Beach, Florida, to Santa Monica, California. (Peele is such a well-known cross country runner that he was consulted by the makers of the hit movie ‚ÄúForrest Gump,‚Äù who wanted firsthand information on what it‚Äôs like to run the kind of distances portrayed in the movie by actor Tom Hanks.) Peele and his running companion averaged 48 miles a day., In Arizona, Peele and his companion parted ways, which they often did, having run out of conversation after spending so much time side-by-side., ‚ÄúYou go your different ways and discuss it later,‚Äù Peele explained., PEELE STUMBLES INTO RESTRICTED TERRITORY, Peele said he had unknowingly run into a government restricted area, where he came upon railroad tracks that resembled a roller coaster ride., ‚ÄúIt was pulled out,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand because of the way that railroads are connected, one rail to the next, it literally made loops. It was quite bizarre and I did not know what I was seeing at the time. I‚Äôm still not a hundred percent sure. But I went over towards that and started following it. And at one point I came upon a large ‚Äì what looked to me, and I‚Äôm a fighter pilot, so I say this with some knowledge ‚Äì I saw what looked like a wing.‚Äù, The ‚Äúwing‚Äù was extremely thin and, though it was eight-feet long, it was so light that Peele was able to use two fingers and from the end hold it horizontally with no problems. The wing was also very strong but it was still possible to bend it. He began to gather other little ‚Äúremnants‚Äù of what he felt was an obvious crash. There was a kind of Plexiglas or carbon glass present that was unbreakable, although some of it had shattered from impact into the rocks in the desert., ‚ÄúBut you could pick up a piece of it and you could not break it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt bring any of that. I was a little bit concerned that this might be radioactive. I didn‚Äôt know what I was dealing with.‚Äù, ¬†AND THERE IS THE GLOVE, ‚ÄúAnd then I found the glove,‚Äù Peele said., There were actually two gloves. Again, not knowing if the objects were radioactive, and whether he might have to at some point simply get rid of the gloves, Peele hid one in a small cavern under some rocks. He acknowledges that the markings he used wouldn‚Äôt be there now, but he has enough of a visual memory stored in his mind that he feels confident he could find the glove and wreckage debris again., One of the two gloves was in much better condition than the other, so, in case he eventually had to get rid of them, he preferred to keep the one in good condition hidden away in the Arizona desert. Since it turned out he was able to keep the glove, he said, he should have brought the good one home., In any case, the gloves were made with some sort of a hide. They had a pressure valve on the outside/backside of the hand. There was a zipper that worked from the inside and enclosed something very similar to Nomex, a fire retardant fabric first developed by DuPont in the 1960s., The glove was so small that there was no way it could have fit a human hand. There was a prehensile or ‚Äúopposable‚Äù thumb, meaning a thumb that can be placed opposite the fingers of the same hand, thus allowing the digits to grasp and handle objects. Opposable thumbs are characteristic of primates, such as human beings, and were a crucial step in our evolution., ‚ÄúWhen you hold it,‚Äù Peele said, ‚Äúyou understand that it is not from Planet Earth. You can‚Äôt look at it and see how it was made and see how detailed everything is. But there‚Äôs no hand that would fit it that could be used for any particular reason that we know.‚Äù, The glove also had what seemed like writing, mainly incomprehensible and most likely nonhuman words. But Peele was able to read the English words ‚Äúsecure‚Äù and ‚Äúlarge.‚Äù, A ‚ÄòCHILLING‚Äô FIND, At this point in the interview, Beckley interjected, ‚ÄúIn this field, physical evidence like an alien artifact is almost impossible to come by and is always in dispute. But there is something so strange and peculiar about this that it almost sends chills up and down one‚Äôs spine. OK, here‚Äôs the glove. We don‚Äôt know who it belonged to. Would an alien race be that close to us that they would have a glove? And have four fingers and a prehensile thumb? It would indicate to me that we might be talking about something from the future or something from a parallel universe.‚Äù, Peele replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve certainly given the parallel universe concept much thought. But that‚Äôs what was so cool about this glove. People would hold it and say, ‚ÄòOoh, it‚Äôs like my hands are tingling.‚Äô Everybody who saw it ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to say they were freaked out, but they WERE freaked out., ‚ÄúA large number of people did see it,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúbecause I would show it in my store. It was called 21st Century Foods and was the first vegetarian restaurant and health food store in the area. I would keep it in the restaurant there and people would come in. They had heard about it because it did have some news media coverage.‚Äù, People would ask to see the glove and it sometimes caused some of the curiosity seekers to become so unnerved that they would exit the restaurant., ‚ÄúMost people watch ‚ÄòStar Trek‚Äô or whatever,‚Äù Peele reasoned, ‚Äúbut they don‚Äôt really want that to be real. Other people DO want it to be real. I‚Äôve always felt we cannot be egotistical enough to think we are the only humanoid-type beings in the universe. Think about the variety of people on our planet and then expand that to over a few thousand light years away. We have to have others that are similar to us ‚Äì more advanced, less advanced. Not as nice, nicer. They‚Äôre out there.‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlien Artifacts: Incredible Evidence of Exotic Material from UFO Encounters‚Äù also features chapters on subjects like the falling of ‚Äúangel hair‚Äù from the sky, a miniature UFO ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù by young boys in Japan, and much more, making it an impressive collection of paranormal lore and educated speculation on some of what the aliens have left behind after their encounters with earthlings. The book quite likely stands alone in that regard, approaching the UFO subject from a truly unique vantage point that brings the scientific analysis of the bizarre remains at least into the realm of possibility.¬† ¬†, SUGGESTED READING, Alien Artifacts: Incredible Evidence of Exotic Material from UFO Encounters, Timothy Green Beckley‚Äôs Bizarre Bazaar: UFO Encounters ‚Äì Ghosts and Hauntings ‚Äì Unknown Creatures ‚Äì Mysteries of the Hollow Earth and MORE!, Dulce Warriors: Aliens Battle For Earth‚Äôs Domination, Alien Lives Matter: It‚Äôs OK To Be Grey, By Sean Casteel, It has become an increasingly popular notion that linear time, time measured from the past, the present and the future, is not the complete story. The many variations from our normal perception of time spring from numerous source experiences, to include UFO encounters, Near Death Experiences, and Past Life Experiences. Even the CIA, in its formerly classified Remote Viewing program, encountered movements in time in addition to ‚Äúseeing‚Äù the desired targets., In his recent book, ‚ÄúTime Slip Connexions: We Are Holograms,‚Äù veteran UFO and paranormal researcher Raymond Fowler tackles the tricky subject of ripples in time from many angles while also demonstrating the interrelatedness of things previously thought to be completely separate phenomena., The author of eleven books on UFOs and NDEs, Fowler began his career in the paranormal as a nuts-and-bolts researcher of UFO sightings in the 1960s. Over the decades, he gradually widened his belief system to embrace alien abduction, Near Death Experiences, Out-of-Body experiences and other phenomena that came to seem linked to an overarching intelligence from which everything we know about reality originates., So, what is a Time Slip?, ‚ÄúA Time Slip is an occurrence,‚Äù Fowler writes, ‚Äúin which a person or persons step from their time into another time, either in the past or in the future. A person having a Time Slip may also experience a disquieting, unsettling or depressed feeling at the outset of the event. Some people have even described a sort of fog surrounding them as they emerge into another time. Others as if a vacuum is lowered over them and all sounds around them disappear at the outset of the Time Slip. This also sometimes occurs at the outset of a UFO experience.‚Äù, Fowler‚Äôs interest in the phenomenon began with his own Time Slip experience., ‚ÄúOne morning in the spring of 1980,‚Äù he recalls, ‚Äúwhen I entered the half cellar of our former home in Wenham, Massachusetts, and stepped down a few steps into the full cellar, I instantly became totally paralyzed. Shocked, I found it hard to believe my eyes. A man with my build, wearing a pair of black dress pants and a white shirt, appeared from behind the furnace where our freezer is located. He walked toward me and when he was three feet away from me he turned to my right and walked out of sight toward the cellar stairs. His body was solid, but it had a rapidly vibrating appearance to it. I could not make out facial features. Then, just as suddenly, I could move. I was dumbfounded and ran into the full cellar to find no one there. I called up to my wife and asked her if she had just been down in the cellar. She had not. In any event, the figure was exactly my build and was wearing black pants and a white shirt!‚Äù, Fowler says he only later came to realize what had happened when one day he went to retrieve some frozen vegetables from the freezer in the cellar. He was wearing a pair of black dress pants and a white shirt and followed the exact same path as the apparition. He is convinced that what he saw in spring of 1980 was himself in the future., ‚ÄúI can think of no other explanation,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúI was not hallucinating. I saw the man distinctly. The cellar was well lighted with sunlight pouring in a window to my left.‚Äù, Fowler continues by saying that the only time he would be attired in black dress pants and a white shirt would have been for the weddings of three of his children, in 1983, 1989, and 1991. He would continue to have Time Slip experiences and eventually decided to write ‚ÄúTime Slip Connexions‚Äù, The book examines several hypotheses concerning the structure of the universe and its relationship to time. it also provides an overview of research by the CIA that concluded that time, as we experience it, is an illusion and that so-called past events can be accessed via altered states of perception., One obvious and very disturbing implication of the Time Slip phenomenon is that future events can be foretold. Even Fowler‚Äôs brief encounter with his future self in the cellar implies that some events are etched in stone and that we eventually ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù with such events after the passage of time., Meaning, if time is an illusion, then so is free will. Fowler goes in-depth in his investigation of current theories concerning the ‚ÄúHolographic Universe,‚Äù part of which leads to the conclusion that we exist in a predetermined hologram, similar to a video game, which is overseen by an advanced race of aliens who both created and control us all. We exist as mere holographic contrivances, made up of energetic atoms that masquerade as solid flesh and bone., The late sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick wrote along similar lines, and there are those who claim that his work was appropriated and used in the popular movie franchise ‚ÄúThe Matrix,‚Äù which also centers on the artificial, mechanized nature of reality. The subtitle of Fowler‚Äôs previous book, ‚ÄúUFOs: The Ultimate Abduction: We Are Property,‚Äù which demonstrates that Fowler is proceeding along a path where free will is brought into question ‚Äì if not done away with completely., To make his argument, Fowler offers nearly a hundred anecdotal case histories of Time Slips, from retro-cognition experiences, in which a person steps bodily into a past time and even interacts with the environment there, to glimpses of the near future that are sometimes sent as a friendly warning to help experiencers to avoid certain forms of danger., In one of the appendixes to ‚ÄúTime Slip Connexions,‚Äù Fowler reports on some of the quantum physics and hard science that may be at play in the CIA‚Äôs sometimes successful remote viewing efforts. It is reassuring to learn that such a mystical and ‚Äúout there‚Äù program has hard scientific support at all., As we continue to struggle with questions of space and time, Raymond Fowler is on the frontlines, fighting to make sense of the unknowable in both scientific and spiritual terms, two fields of study that are gradually beginning to merge together into what may prove to be a beautiful and wondrous truth., By Sean Casteel, When Timothy Green Beckley died in May 2021, he left behind a paranormal publishing empire that will forever be a testimony to one man‚Äôs drive and determination to learn the truth about both our world and the hidden worlds that surround it. His catalogue of books devoted to the strange and supernatural now numbers in the several dozens, dating from the present all the way back to the 1960s, when he began his first publishing ventures as a teenager., Tim R. Swartz and I have shared the privilege of finishing up some of the incomplete projects that remained after Tim Beckley‚Äôs passing, the latest of which is called ‚ÄúTimothy Green Beckley‚Äôs Bizarre Bazaar.‚Äù The book is a compilation of shorter pieces authored by Beckley, Swartz and I, beginning with an introduction by Beckley‚Äôs longtime working partner Carol Ann Rodriguez., Carol provides a rundown of the many authors Tim Beckley brought to the world‚Äôs attention over the years, such as contactees George Adamski and George Hunt Williamson, as well as Nick Redfern, John Keel, the Rev. Barry Downing, and Hungarian-born psychic Maria D‚ÄôAndrea. Tracy Twyman‚Äôs ‚ÄúSex Slaves of the CIA‚Äù is an indication, Carol says, of how controversial some of Beckley‚Äôs titles can be, making him the ‚ÄúKing of Fringe Publishers,‚Äù a title he humbly welcomed., Beckley also edited newsstand publications, like ‚ÄúUFO Universe,‚Äù for decades, and paid his dues by working as a freelance contributor to the ‚ÄúEnquirer.‚Äù He was invited to speak on the subject of UFOs to a closed-door meeting of the House of Lords in London and visited Loch Ness while in the UK., Carol concludes by saying, ‚ÄúTruly, it can be said of Timothy Green Beckley what has been said of other greats: His like will not be seen again.‚Äù, THE TORCH IS PASSED, As one era ends, another begins. Beckley‚Äôs imprints of Inner Light and Global Communications are still in business, (mostly on Amazon.com) but have now been joined by a new imprint run by Tim R. Swartz called Zontar Press. ‚ÄúTimothy Green Beckley‚Äôs Bizarre Bazaar‚Äù is the first book released by Zontar Press and the hope is that there will be many more., What can perhaps be most easily appreciated about ‚ÄúBizarre Bazaar‚Äù is how it opens up a window into a large assortment of other books Beckley brought into the world. One of the more ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù titles worked on by Tim Swartz and myself, as well as by several other contributors, was ‚ÄúScrewed by the Aliens: True Sexual Encounters with ETs.‚Äù, THE SEXUAL FACTOR IS EXPLORED, In a chapter in ‚ÄúBizarre Bazaar‚Äù entitled ‚ÄúThe Sexterrestrials Are Here ‚Äì And They Want To Breed With You,‚Äù the opening bullets ask: ‚ÄúAre you ready to explore a region of the paranormal that is typically relegated to the ‚Äòghetto‚Äô neighborhood of UFO research? Does the idea of sex with aliens thrill you or repel you? You will likely be surprised to learn how commonplace sexual incidents onboard the ships and among the aliens truly are. It‚Äôs a frequent happenstance, but is rarely talked about, even among diehard believers in alien abduction.‚Äù, By employing several writers to tackle the subject of sex with aliens, Beckley was able to provide numerous perspectives on the issue that run the gamut from extremely hostile accusations of rape to more benign beliefs, like a benevolent hybrid breeding program that will ultimately save mankind from total extinction. It was Beckley‚Äôs intention to confront the sexual issue head on, from many points of view, and as honestly as the data allow., ¬†A longtime acquaintance of Beckley‚Äôs, the artist David Huggins, claimed to have a romantic interstellar relationship with a pretty female alien called ‚ÄúCrescent,‚Äù whom Huggins called his ‚Äúsoul mate.‚Äù Their relationship lasted for decades and resulted in Crescent bearing the children of Huggins. He filled many canvases depicting his amorous adventures with the otherworldly woman and also put together a movie on their relationship called ‚ÄúLove and Saucers‚Äù that is available for streaming On Demand on iTunes, Amazon, Vimeo, Google Play and YouTube. It‚Äôs a fascinating reversal of the more frequently encountered horrifying atrocities of sex-related UFO experiences and may truly be a case of ‚ÄúLove Triumphant.‚Äù, When Beckley and his team of researchers were writing ‚ÄúScrewed By The Aliens,‚Äù the word ‚Äúexophiliac‚Äù was unearthed. It means ‚Äúa person who craves sex with aliens.‚Äù If, on the other hand, you shy away from the aliens and want them to keep their hands to themselves, you are a bit harder to classify, Beckley explains. ‚ÄúAstrophobia‚Äù is a fear of outer space and everything in it, so that would include ETs. ‚ÄúXenophobia‚Äù is a fear of anyone from another place, often defined as ‚Äúa fear of foreigners.‚Äù In any case, Beckley grappled mightily with finding language to fit the phenomenon., BECKLEY‚ÄôS SALAD DAYS, Beckley‚Äôs own contact experiences, as is so often case with those who have a history of encounters, began in his childhood., In an early chapter of ‚ÄúBizarre Bazaar,‚Äù Beckley writes, ‚ÄúWhile it is open for debate, I can trace my UFOlogical roots back to 1957, when I sighted two objects revolving overhead in the sky. One was hovering over an abandoned factory building across the street from where l lived in New Jersey, while the other stood still almost perfectly above the house that my grandparents owned. I didn‚Äôt observe any portholes, ‚Äòlittle green men‚Äô didn‚Äôt wave at me, but I fully realized ‚Äì despite a pronouncement by the authorities in the paper a couple of days later to the effect that we were all hypnotized by the appearance of a couple of weather balloons ‚Äì that these lights, objects, craft (call them what you may) seemed to be under intelligent control. Indeed, they were not bobbing and weaving in the air current. In fact, they seemed to know what they were doing (whatever that was), which I think ‚Äì at least partly ‚Äì was to get my attention and push me into unknown territory.‚Äù ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†, The sighting experience changed Beckley‚Äôs life. He bought all the material he could find on the subject, including a copy of ‚ÄúFATE Magazine,‚Äù for whom he would later write as an adult. He started writing letters to the local newspaper, as well as pestering a couple of reporters he knew who shared his thinking on the subject, meaning that we were being observed by someone or something else., In the ensuing decades, Beckley became an expert on the subject, published several nationally distributed newsstand magazines on UFOs, and eventually built his own micro-mini ‚Äúempire,‚Äù publishing nearly 300 volumes on the paranormal. To see most of them, simply go to Amazon.com and type in Inner Light ‚Äì Global Communications under Books., Even more of Beckley‚Äôs well-spent youth can be discovered in a reprint of his earlier work called ‚ÄúInside the Saucers,‚Äù which deals further with his adolescence in the thrall of the UFOs. The reprinted book is subtitled ‚ÄúMr. UFO‚Äôs Teenage Years,‚Äù and was published in 2017., ‚ÄúSTUMBLE BACK INTO TIME,‚Äù the back cover beckons, ‚ÄúWITH THIS GENUINE COLLECTOR‚ÄôS REPRINT OF A RECENTLY REDISCOVERED UFO CLASSIC., ‚ÄúHERE, AFTER FIFTY YEARS, ARE THE CONFESSIONS AND RECOLLECTIONS OF A TEEN UFO RESEARCHER TURNED SPACED-OUT ‚ÄòSTUD.‚Äô, ‚ÄúAs UFO satirist and ‚ÄòExploring the Bizarre‚Äô co-host Tim Beckley so righteously puts it, ‚ÄòA lot of boys my age were probably starting to think about girls and sneaking a peek at their father‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlayboy‚Äù collection. Well, it took me a few years to get into the sins of the flesh (as it turned out, about ten years later I became a reporter for ‚ÄúHustler‚Äù magazine). Instead, at 14 or 15, I was reading magazines like ‚ÄúFate‚Äù and ‚ÄúFlying Saucers From Other Worlds.‚Äù And along the way I hooked up with a small collective of other blossoming teenage UFOlogists who eventually became part of the backbone of the field as it exists today: Allen Greenfield, Dave Halperin, Gene Steinberg, Rick Hilberg, Jerry Clark ‚Äì this is as much the story of the early days of their calling as it is mine.‚Äô, ‚ÄúIn 1962, Tim Beckley placed a notice in the Club News section of ‚ÄúFlying Saucers‚Äù magazine requesting correspondence and an exchange of information with like-minded individuals willing to share their knowledge about those silvery ships seen around the world, best known in those days as ‚Äòflying saucers.‚Äô, ‚ÄúThrough the personals column of this relatively obscure publication, he met several other teenagers who had started to form their own UFO organizations, so ‚ÄòTimmy‚Äô followed suit by setting up ‚ÄúThe Interplanetary News Service,‚Äù which issued a semi-professional publication that garnered a worldwide circulation of 1500 plus. Many members of his ‚Äòyouth group‚Äô were well-established UFO experiencers and elder statesmen in the field. The INS became the third largest UFO group in the nation, behind NICAP and APRO., ‚ÄúIn order to finance his mushrooming enterprise, Beckley began to issue privately published UFO books and literature that would help further the cause and defray his expenses. ‚ÄòInside the Saucers‚Äô was the first such work. It was printed on an old fashioned (appropriately enough) spirit duplicator, and had a print run of 300 copies, which sold out in a matter of months. This ‚Äònew‚Äô edition is an exact replica of that first work, with only the addition of several photos and the elimination of typos., ‚ÄúRegardless of the age of the authors, as can be rapidly determined, the writing is polished and sophisticated for its time in the history of UFO research. In this reprint of a rare collector‚Äôs item, you will become personally involved in a discussion of the following ‚Äòlong lost‚Äô topics: A possible solution to the mystery of the Men In Black; How some UFOs may be the product of Nazi technology (a prediction made years before this concept was put forward seriously elsewhere); Possible synchronicities associated with the Great Pyramid; The Unidentified Submerged Object that plunged into a New Jersey reservoir; A recap of the most dramatic UFO sightings and encounters from this period by ‚ÄúUFO Encyclopedia‚Äù author Jerome Clark; A detailed summary of 15 years of UFO research by George D. Fawcett; AND MUCH MORE!, ‚ÄúThe late Brad Steiger, a longtime master of paranormal literature, had these fond comments: ‚ÄòBless all those Teen UFOlogists! They were great supporters of a young Brad as he began his UFO career with ‚ÄúStrangers From The Skies‚Äù in 1966. . . Forever allies!‚Äô‚Äù, A DEMON WITH BLOOD ON ITS HANDS?, Amityville., The very name of the small Long Island, New York, community instantly conjures visions of horror, of a death-dealing psychopath laying waste his parents, two sisters and two brothers with a Marlin rifle. The egregious murders were chronicled in both a bestselling book and a major Hollywood studio movie and have become, pardon the pun, a ‚Äúhousehold name‚Äù: The Amityville Horror.¬†, The convicted killer was Ronald DeFeo, Jr., whom one judge called ‚Äúthe devil incarnate.‚Äù DeFeo told varying versions of what happened the night of November 13, 1974, including the claim that he was possessed by an evil spirit and had committed the crime through no free will of his own., While it is of course impossible to decide the existence or nonexistence of the devil and his demons in a court of law, the evil-spirit-possession argument was entered along with an insanity plea. Ultimately, Defeo received a 25 years to life sentence for each of his victims and remains in prison today., But is it so easy to simply scoff at Defeo‚Äôs claim to have been an unwitting agent for the devil? Could it possibly be that Defeo was telling the truth of what happened?, This is one of many issues dealt with in the book issued by Timothy Green Beckley‚Äôs Global Communications/Conspiracy Journal publishing house. Entitled ‚ÄúAmityville and Beyond, The Lore of the Poltergeist and Other Petrifying Paranormal Phenomena,‚Äù the book breaks new ground in making some overdue correlations between spirit possession, ghosts and even the UFO/alien presence. What Beckley and his writers are aiming for is to make apparent an overarching ‚Äútheory of everything‚Äù that ties up the loose ends of many different forms of paranormal activity in the world today., A PARANORMAL RESEARCHER‚ÄôS EARLY POLTERGEIST ENCOUNTER, Paul Eno is among the topnotch researchers Beckley assembled for the writing of ‚ÄúAmityville and Beyond.‚Äù Currently Eno hosts, along with his son Ben, a radio show called ‚ÄúBehind the Paranormal‚Äù based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island., ‚ÄúAmerican history is full of poltergeists and nasty and vengeful spirits,‚Äù Eno writes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve written about the Bell Witch that frightened a U.S. president so badly that he fled in the early morning hours from a Tennessee homestead. Furthermore, this book contains the full story of the dreadful Amherst poltergeist, which is just as scary as any similar saga of evil you are likely to hear about from an historical perspective., ‚ÄúMy attitude about such cases,‚Äù Eno continues, ‚Äúis a bit more ‚Äòradical‚Äô than the views of other researchers, who tend to treat such poltergeist outbreaks as either restless spirits gone awry or put them in the general category of a purely psychological manifestation attributable to the witnesses‚Äô psychological state. I see such outbreaks more akin to a crossing of parallel dimensions by a variety of beings often mistaken for the undead ‚Äì though they seem to have, in many instances, the same attributes as so-called ‚Äòaliens.‚Äô Even cryptids from the darkest realms of our minds have recently been brought into the poltergeist equation.‚Äù, Here Eno has very succinctly expressed the overall theme of ‚ÄúAmityville and Beyond,‚Äù that aliens and cryptid creatures like Dogmen are cut from the same cloth as ‚Äúnoisy ghosts‚Äù and possessive demons. Eno at one time was an assistant to the famed Ed and Lorraine Warren, the husband/wife paranormal researchers whose work has been the subject of the movies ‚ÄúThe Conjuring‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Conjuring 2.‚Äù¬†, In November 1974, Eno found himself on Lindley Street in Bridgeport, Connecticut, along with Ed, Lorraine and Father William Charbonneau, and an indeterminate number of police and reporters. And a very frightened little family., ‚ÄúThe latter consisted of Gerard Goodin and his adopted daughter and only child, Marcia (pronounced Mar-SEE-a),‚Äù Eno writes. ‚ÄúShortly Mom (Laura Goodin) returned from the St. Vincent‚Äôs Hospital Emergency Room with her right big toe bandaged. It had been broken by a flying television set. The house itself was a mess. ‚ÄòThe Thing,‚Äô as Laura called it, had been tearing pictures, especially religious objects, off the wall all morning. A priest had come to bless the house, apparently to no avail.‚Äù, Calling it the best-witnessed poltergeist event in history, Eno says that violent phenomena were witnessed by almost 100 people in the Bridgeport outbreak. Eno was on the scene himself when some of the bizarre incidents transpired., ‚ÄúI stood in the kitchen,‚Äù Eno writes, ‚Äúwith three firefighters on one side of me and three police officers on the other and watched the refrigerator float off the floor, turn right, turn back, then settle gently back to the floor. Late in the evening of that first day, I was sitting at the kitchen table with Lorraine. Also in the kitchen was a huge police officer, Ed Warren and a reporter from WNAB Radio. Lorraine suddenly let out a yelp. I watched as a second-degree burn, with its trademark white blister, appeared on Lorraine‚Äôs left hand, between thumb and forefinger. This was all caught on the radio reporter‚Äôs tape, which still exists. You can hear a youthful me stating, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a blister forming!‚Äô‚Äù, TOUCHING THE NEAR-INVISIBLE, At another point during Eno‚Äôs visits to the Bridgeport home, he was alone in the house with the Goodins, playing monopoly with Marcia to pass the time and to help her relax., ‚ÄúSuddenly an acrid smell, like ozone mixed with sulfur, came from the kitchen,‚Äù Eno recounts. ‚ÄúInstantly Gerard Goodin was up, dashed into the kitchen and started chanting in Latin! My skin tingled with an electrical charge that I now associate with the electromagnetic ‚Äòbranes,‚Äô as physicists call them, presumably the boundaries between parallel worlds., ‚ÄúA whitish, gauzy cloud began to form in the kitchen,‚Äù Eno continues, ‚Äúand Goodin was back in the living room at once. I was convinced that four entities were ‚Äòarriving‚Äô in the kitchen from Marcia‚Äôs adjacent bedroom. They weren‚Äôt entirely invisible, and there were four distinct shapes coming from the kitchen in a line. They were each about four and a half feet high and had rounded tops, with no discernible head or shoulders.‚Äù, Goodin saw the figures also, and he followed one as it moved from the kitchen. As the mystery entities entered the living room one by one, Laura Goodin started to cry while Marcia clung to Eno for comfort. Then one of the almost-invisible things approached Eno and stopped., ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I made my mistake,‚Äù Eno confesses. ‚ÄúI began to feel angry toward this thing, which at the time I thought was a demon in the classic, theological sense. I was angry because it was obviously trying to get to this child. The whatever-it-was simply fed on the negative energy I was releasing and grew stronger., ‚ÄúWhat happened next was the biggest shock I‚Äôd experienced in paranormal work up to that time. As the entity moved to get around me and at the girl, I instinctively pushed toward it. It resisted as though it was entirely material. In fact, I felt flesh and bone structure as if this were a solid being. These ‚Äòdemons‚Äô were supposed to be spirits!‚Äù, Eno says it took him many years to come to grips with the experience, let alone explain it in terms of parallel worlds. He never even reported it to the Warrens, and it was decades before he could write or speak about it., ‚ÄúWhile I stood there dazed,‚Äù he continues, ‚Äúthe entity got around me and threw Marcia across the living room. She ran back to me, crying. Finally, as the gauzy cloud inundated the whole interior of the house, and as I tired from, I would say today, being drained by this powerful parasite, I ordered everyone outside.‚Äù, Although the police had cleared away the crowds and cordoned off both ends of Lindley Street, there were still thousands of onlookers gawking from each end of the block., ‚ÄúI could hear a voice in the crowd,‚Äù Eno writes, ‚Äúpreaching something about all this being a ‚Äòsign of the end.‚Äô These being the days long before cell phones, I had to use a neighbor‚Äôs phone to call the Warrens. It took them an hour to get back into the city because of all the traffic caused by this paranormal circus. When they finally arrived at about 9:15 P.M., we all reentered the house. Things were quiet.‚Äù, When Eno writes about the creature he pushed against as being almost invisible yet possessing a flesh and bone structure, what manner of being is this? It sounds not unlike the physical-yet-not-physical ‚Äúbodies‚Äù of the familiar gray aliens whose stock in trade is the abduction of chosen subjects for whatever dark reasons are left for us to discover. As Eno so clearly explains, the aliens and demons who cross between dimensions may be one and the same entity but are given different names in scripture and folklore that vary according to who encounters the strange interlopers.¬†¬†¬†, AND THEN THE TERROR SPOKE . . ., Evil speaking voices are also dealt with in a chapter of ‚ÄúAmity and Beyond‚Äù by Tim R. Swartz called ‚ÄúWhen the Poltergeist Finds Its Voice.‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt can be terrifying enough,‚Äù Swartz writes, ‚Äúwhen a poltergeist makes its appearance in a household. Rocks thrown about, strange bangs on the walls, moving furniture, items disappearing and then reappearing ‚Äì this is enough to set anyone on edge. However, when a poltergeist finds its voice and starts to talk, you know that events have decidedly taken a turn for the worse., ‚ÄúPoltergeist activity has been recorded throughout history,‚Äù Swartz goes on, ‚Äúand is probably the most prolific of all supernatural events. A poltergeist is extremely aware of its surroundings and will often quickly respond to suggestions by observers and other external stimuli. This shows that there is some kind of ‚Äòintelligence‚Äô behind its pranks and not just some random psychokinesis (PK). This intelligence, along with an ability to communicate, will manifest in a myriad of ways. Pieces of paper with strange messages appear; writing on the walls; children‚Äôs toys will be arranged to make words; and, perhaps the most shocking, they will sometimes start to speak out loud.‚Äù¬†¬†, According to Swartz, when a poltergeist achieves speech, it generally starts as animal-like growls and whispers that slowly evolve into discernible words. Most poltergeists never reach this stage in their development, but, once they do, a clear ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù emerges from what were previously just random events., Swartz recounts some case histories in the annals of poltergeist hauntings in which the intruding spirit spoke to its victims., The 1817 case of the ‚ÄúBell Witch,‚Äù the name for the poltergeist who took up residence among a Tennessee farming family headed by John Bell, Sr., is an interesting example. ‚ÄúThe Witch‚Äù was extremely talkative and could imitate the voices of people from the area., ‚ÄúThe poltergeist was said to speak at a nerve-wracking pitch when displeased,‚Äù Swartz reports, ‚Äúwhile at other times it sang and talked in low musical tones. In one instance, it was alleged to have repeated, verbatim, sermons administered by two preachers, occurring at separate locations, that took place simultaneously. The sermons recited by the witch were verified by people attending the churches as being identical in voice, tone, inflection and content. The poltergeist was even known to attend church and sing along with the congregation, using the most beautiful voice anyone had ever heard.‚Äù, Stories of a talking mongoose named Gef, who bedeviled an Irish family in the 1930s, as well as the tale of a Spanish family who heard maniacal laughter and voices emanating from their kitchen stove, help to round out Swartz‚Äôs examination of real-life incidents of ‚Äútalking‚Äù spirits., He also touches on the Middle Eastern folklore and Islamic theology dealing with the ‚Äúdjinn,‚Äù or genies, who can take possession of buildings or locations and torment any person who goes to live there. The djinn can levitate and cause objects to disappear as well as take any physical form they want ‚Äì humans, animals and anything else. They can mimic the voices of deceased humans, claiming to be spirits or Satan. They enjoy playing tricks and frightening people. In fact, they can sense strong emotions such as fear or grief and gain energy from those powerful feelings., ‚ÄúLike humans,‚Äù Swartz writes, ‚Äúthe djinn have distinct personalities. There are those who are of low intelligence, quick to anger and fond of playing tricks. Others have a superior intellect and act more along the lines of guardian angels rather than tricksters.‚Äù, ‚ÄúTimothy Green Beckley‚Äôs Bizarre Bazaar‚Äù is, as the title suggests, a marketplace of the strange that has been gathered and assembled through years of hard work and painstaking research. When you buy this book, you are also buying a guide into a library of the strange that will take you to many destinations. Each chapter deals with its own unique paranormal-themed book that can be added to your personal reading list and provide you with an invaluable education in UFOs, aliens, ghosts, demonic spirits, angelic spirits and more.¬†¬†¬†, SUGGESTED READING:, TIMOTHY BECKLEY‚ÄôS BIZARRE AND UNEXPLAINED WORLDS, TIMOTHY GREEN BECKLEY‚ÄôS UFO SPIN DOCTORS, TIMOTHY GREEN BECKLEY‚ÄôS BIZARRE BAZAAR, By Sean Casteel, As the saying from many centuries ago declares, ‚ÄúIn the midst of life, we are in death.‚Äù, Timothy Green Beckley, Tim Swartz and I were completely absorbed in the book project that was to become ‚ÄúDulce Warriors: Aliens Battle for Earth‚Äôs Domination.‚Äù It was the usual back and forth between new material, proofreading and illustrating the various chapters and sections, a routine the three of us were used to after working as a team for nearly twenty years., Then fate, Father Time, or whatever name you wish to give it, took Tim Beckley from us before the project was completely finished. As a tribute to our much revered publisher and editor, Tim Swartz and I decided to complete the project ‚Äì just the two of us ‚Äì along with more than 20 other contributors. ‚ÄúDulce Warriors‚Äù is now available on Amazon., The book opens with tributes from a few of Tim B‚Äôs friends and coworkers, in which they offer memories of how Tim helped to guide their career and gave them an opportunity to explore various aspects of UFOs and other paranormal subjects., Tim Beckley also authored the first chapter, entitled ‚ÄúA Terrifying Introduction: What Happened On Our Way To Dulce,‚Äù in which he presents a laundry list of frightful rumors about the underground joint human/alien installation reputed to be located in Dulce, New Mexico, which is near the Four Corners region of the American Southwest., ‚ÄúWhen we speak of Dulce,‚Äù Beckley writes, ‚Äúwe speak of: Monster Factories, Alien Cloning, Underground Tunnel Systems, MK-Ultra Soldiers ‚Äì Disguised as Greys, Aliens Torturing Humans, Children Disappearing, Government Germ Warfare Weapons, Human and Animal Mutilations, and the Suicide Or Murder Of Numerous Researchers Associated With Dulce.‚Äù, A SCIENTIST STUMBLES INTO THE UNKNOWN, But where did it all start?, Beckley felt the whole macabre saga started with an engineer by the name of Paul Bennewitz, who believed aliens were communicating with him over a radio receiver. He also observed and photographed UFOs flying over nearby Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico, specifically the nuclear storage facility there, called the Monzano Storage Area, the country‚Äôs largest underground nuclear storage facility., Perhaps the most vocal and visible expert on the Dulce mysteries is Norio Hayakawa, who has written many articles on the subject and appeared numerous times on radio and television programs dealing with the town. Hayakawa says the proximity to Albuquerque is very important because it is where German scientists were first transferred in 1945, immediately after World War II, through the Operation Paperclip Program. In addition to German scientists, skilled intelligence officers were imported as well., According to Hayakawa, ‚ÄúDulce is a location filled with mysteries that are still ongoing. I believe it is far more interesting than Roswell, Yes, Roswell was significant in that it is the alleged location of the crash of extraterrestrial vehicles in 1947. But, you know, that was it. But Dulce is something different. It is an ongoing thing that is still taking place.‚Äù, Dulce has the highest percentage per population of UFO sightings, Hayakawa says. Almost the entire population has experienced a sighting of strange objects in the past three to four decades., THE GOVERNMENT TAKES AN INTEREST, But back to Bennewitz. The story goes that Bennewitz was a scientist living near Kirtland Air Force Base. In 1979, he began to observe the flights of mysterious objects from his home and to photograph them as well. When he attempted to report to official channels on the strange aerial activity he was witnessing, he immediately drew the interest of the government., One theory is that the bewildered Bennewitz was seeing test flights of what are called ‚ÄúUAVs,‚Äù or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, pilotless aircraft that are remotely controlled either on the ground or programmed by onboard computer systems. Whatever the secret flights involved, the government did not want Bennewitz to know the truth., It is alleged that the government brainwashed Bennewitz into believing that he was witnessing flights of alien discs over Kirtland Air Force Base. Bennewitz received a message somehow, either by radio or over his computer, saying that there is a secret base 150 miles north of Albuquerque in the mountains underground. Bennewitz was provided with the exact coordinates of this alien base, which, of course, turned out to be Dulce., Bennewitz was never able to prove either the existence of aliens over Kirtland or the government‚Äôs manipulations of his attempts to document the mysterious overflights. He sank deeper and deeper into an increasingly paranoid frame of mind, unable to cope with the bizarre scenario in which he had been ensnared., REVEALING HELL ITSELF, While Bennewitz‚Äôs personal struggles certainly deserve our sympathy, his revelations about the underground base at Dulce were nothing short of spectacular. The rumors that have circulated since then are full of nightmare scenarios, like huge vats of human and animal body parts used in genetic experiments, perhaps in further efforts to create an alien-human hybrid species or an even stranger chimera that is part human and part animal., It is speculated that the government and the aliens may be working to create a ‚Äúperfect soldier,‚Äù one that is capable of fearlessness and obedience beyond that of a normal GI grunt., Additionally, there is the case of a female abductee who claimed that she was in one of the lower sections of Dulce when an alien walked right through the wall and raped her. That kind of forced copulation may also be a component of the genetic experimentation said to take place in Dulce, the goal being to impregnate the human female with alien seed and see what is produced, a scenario already familiar from other stories of abduction., BOTH HUMANS AND ALIENS TAKE UP ARMS, Bill Birnes, the noted author, researcher and television personality, says he doubts that Dulce has any genuine alien presence. But he did pass along what has become an incident repeatedly referred to in discussions of Dulce, the ‚ÄúFirefight at Dulce.‚Äù, ‚ÄùThe story goes that way back in the 1980s,‚Äù Birnes said, ‚Äúthe extraterrestrials were giving a lecture to some scientists. In that demonstration, a lot of the scientists were getting sick because of what the aliens were doing. So some of our military guards, who were prohibited from entering the area and prohibited from carrying any kind of weapons into the area, suddenly burst in to protect the scientists., ‚ÄúAnd the aliens reacted,‚Äù Birnes continued, ‚Äúby basically turning their weapons on the security guards, killing them. Some aliens were killed and some scientists were killed. Supposedly we all worked very hard to try and patch it together so there wouldn‚Äôt be any more incidents like that.‚Äù, ‚ÄúDulce Warriors‚Äù also contains chapters with other similar real life sci-fi overtones and the stories of whistleblowers who have since died, many under suspicious circumstances., WHAT SECRETS DIED WITH HIM?, Tim Swartz provides the story of Phil Schneider, who claimed to be an ex-government structural engineer who was involved in the building of underground military bases around the country. Schneider also said he was one of only three people to survive the incident between the alien greys and U.S. forces that Bill Birnes describes above., For two years prior to his death, Schneider had been on a lecture tour talking about government cover-ups, black budgets and UFOs. His ex-wife, Cynthia Drayer, believes that Schneider was murdered because he publicly revealed the truth about the U.S. government‚Äôs involvement with UFOs, which he said dated back to the Eisenhower administration., To get the details of this fascinating story, as told by Swartz with the assistance of Drayer, it is probably better to read the chapter in the actual book, which will provide much more spine-tinging detail than is possible in this article., In guiding Tim Swartz and me through the editorial process, Tim B. displays his usual sure hand in selecting the people to contribute their work to the book, as well as covering the subject of Dulce thoroughly and with a vast array of on-the-scene participants, rumors and researchers. People who are unfamiliar with the subject of Dulce will get a valuable education in the subject and it will likewise be appreciated by those who have heard some of this before., When Tim Swartz and I put ‚ÄúDulce Warriors: Aliens Battle for Earth‚Äôs Domination‚Äù to bed with the printer, we agreed that Tim B. would be proud., SUGGESTED READING, Dulce Warriors: Aliens Battle for Earth‚Äôs Domination, The Dulce Wars, Underground Alien Bio Lab At Dulce: The Bennewitz UFO Papers, Alien Strongholds on Earth: Secret UFO Bases Exist All Around Us, Timothy Green Beckley‚Äôs UFO Spin Doctors, , July 13, 1947 ‚Äì May 31, 2021, When Timothy Green Beckley passed away on May 31, 2021, he left behind a body of work that has few equals in the realms of Ufology and the paranormal., Tim steadfastly pursued the truth underlying the great mysteries of human existence, beginning as a child, hiding underneath his bed covers to read ‚ÄúFATE Magazine‚Äù by flashlight or listening to all-night paranormal radio host Long John Nebel, whose call-in show on a major New York station became the template for shows that came later, like Art Bell‚Äôs Coast to Coast. In the early 1960s, Tim began his publishing efforts as a teenager, grinding out UFO magazines on an old-fashioned mimeograph machine and building a goodly-sized mailing list of subscribers., Working as a freelance stringer for The National Enquirer, he covered a great many stories of UFO landings and alien abductions. Tim thus earned a kind of ‚Äústreet cred‚Äù as a journalist of off-the-beaten-path type subjects. For a time he published a newsstand magazine called ‚ÄúUFO Universe‚Äù that ran for several years, as well as the newsletter ‚ÄúThe Conspiracy Journal,‚Äù which got its title long before Q-Anon gave conspiracy theory a bad name.¬†, Tim was even better known for the books he published through his Global Communications and Inner Light Books publishing houses. Most of them are still available from Amazon.com. Do a search there and you may be pleasantly surprised at the wealth of what is on offer., For the sake of paying homage to ‚ÄúMr. UFO,‚Äù we have assembled memories and testimonials from some of Tim‚Äôs most prolific and ‚Äì and grateful ‚Äì authors and friends. ¬†¬†, , TIMOTHY BECKLEY- ALWAYS A FREE SPIRIT, By Maria D‚ÄôAndrea¬†¬† MsD, D.D.,DRH, Maria D‚ÄôAndrea is a fulltime psychic who wrote several books that Tim published, books she always adamantly declared were written to be used only in the most positive of ways. She wrote several ‚ÄúHow-To‚Äù books that teach the reader to awaken the psychic powers within and put them to benevolent use for a myriad of reasons. One of Maria‚Äôs titles is ‚ÄúSupernatural Words of Power,‚Äù part of her ‚ÄúYes, You Can!‚Äù series in which she helps the reader achieve a kind of ‚Äúself-empowerment.‚Äù She also contributed chapters to many books Tim assembled as group efforts in which several writers would offer their insight into a given paranormal topic. ¬†¬†¬†, ******, Tim affected so many lives while he was on this planet that we can‚Äôt even count all of them. With his passing, we are also finding out about things he did to help others that he never spoke about. He just helped everyone he cared about without looking for a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù or acknowledgements. He never mentioned when he was buying food for someone, paying someone‚Äôs rent, contributing to helping someone‚Äôs career or any of the other selfless things he did. He truly came from his heart and will be deeply missed., I met Tim in 1985, when I was working at a psychic event doing Readings. He was already accomplished doing eight million things in his life, and was there promoting his books as a publisher. We started chatting and realized we had much in common and were in sync on a friendship level. Because of our levels of knowledge in the spiritual, psychic, paranormal and UFO fields, he asked me to write a book for him. I explained that I‚Äôd never written one. He countered by explaining that I COULD and gave me a subject he needed a book on at the time. So I gave him the first chapter. After he stopped laughing, he said, ‚ÄúI told you so. And we‚Äôre going to do a lot more.‚Äù, Now I laugh because Tim started me on this path with support and friendship. I have somewhere around 60 books out, including several that I co-authored with talented people.¬† I was a guest on Tim‚Äôs radio show with his co-host Tim Swartz, (Tim was also gracious enough to be on my TV and radio show). I was also able to do numerous¬† types of media work, as well as teaching and speaking in my fields and so on‚Ä¶and it ALL stemmed from him having a gigantic heart and introducing me to many different fields years ago., He was my confidant, close friend, family, travel partner, publisher and partner in crime. Free spirits tend to be this way, right? Tim was always funny. He would come up with hilarious thoughts in an instant and then forget about them. I wish I remembered all of them because they would have made a great book., He would go to some of the same places to eat in his neighborhood in Manhattan and got to know the people who were working there. At times, some of us would get together and go. He would already know what to recommend off the menu that was good and he knew each of us enough to recommend food that fit our individual tastes. Tim loved to get us experimenting with different foods. He was very aware and thoughtful that way., He knew at an early age what his Path of Life was. He started a magazine while young and expanded his horizons as he went along life‚Äôs pathways., I remember when we would go ghost hunting in various states. Even though it was for work, we always had fun. I would find the spirit, if there was one (if a sighting wasn‚Äôt real, he would never make something up) check it out, deal with whatever came up and Tim would write about the experience as a prolific author and speak about it in the media. He loved to enlighten the public on the odd things in our universe., His sense of humor was always there. We would send pictures back and forth as friends and then we would have separate work pictures. He would call me and come up with a title and just say for me to write a book about the subject. Teamwork is always a good thing. So on one occasion, his title for me was ‚ÄúTraveling The Waves Of Time‚Äù and he put a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù picture on the back cover. First I was a little upset, because it was a picture of me on my motorcycle, and here I am being professional. When I called him, Tim said he thought it worked because the book was on travel and that‚Äôs what I was doing. He thought it fit and was fun. What can I say? That was Tim., Another time we spoke about our various UFO experiences He had a few and he also had experiences channeling. He traveled to numerous places on a global level. Tim said one of his favorite places was Bora Bora. I remember him telling me about his visit to Hawaii and the book that came from traveling there. After his book came out about Kahuna Power, for a while we were calling him Daddy Kahuna. He always found out the most interesting, obscure information and then wrote about what he discovered. He was a phenomenal researcher and author. Tim was interested in everything from science to the mystical and the other realms beyond., He was a filmmaker and also acted in some films, plus he was in a book where he looked very ‚Äúdapper.‚Äù, Once during our travels, we were reminiscing, and he told me how, many years ago, he went to a party thrown by the Beatles with sitar music and rock stars among the guests. I was asking more about the party and he looked at me and said it was just one more great party he went to. He loved parties. It just goes to show you how much he got around. Tim was an experienced promoter and had his own band for a while. That is only one example of the interesting contacts he had and many turned into lifelong friends. Tim was really great at anything he set his mind to., He loved to travel and when we would go on a trip I would love to listen to his stories and adventures. He was a larger-than-life person without any ego and a soft heart., We would go to UFO conventions and people would know him and ask his opinion on various matters. He would take the time to give them a real answer from his point of view and not just give a meaningless quick one, even when he was tired., The title ‚ÄúMr. UFO,‚Äù as Tim was known in many circles, came about due to his articles, lectures, books and magazines being on the supernatural, the odd, the offbeat and the unexplained., There‚Äôs no doubt that I loved Tim very much and that he was there for me when it came to my work and my personal life. But if I were to sit here and write about all of his adventures I would be afraid that the police would have to dig him up and arrest him., I am sure there are beings in various realms mourning Tim and wondering what he is up to where he is. After all, being inspirit doesn‚Äôt mean it is an ending, just a different vibrational shift., He was so diverse that it‚Äôs impossible to mention all that he was and all that he did. Anyone knowing Tim was going to enter into unknown territory in a wonderful way. I feel blessed to have been his friend and considered part of his family., , FIRST CONTACT! ‚Äì WITH TIMOTHY GREEN BECKLEY, By Diane Tessman, Diane Tessman is another fulltime psychic, in her case in partnership with an alien named ‚ÄúTibus‚Äù that Diane has been familiar with since childhood. She wrote for Tim extensively and he published her first book in 1983, as well as serving as a constant source of guidance and encouragement for her as a writer. When you read what Diane says below here, you will likely agree that Tim was truly a great romantic at heart. He frequently referred to Diane as a ‚ÄúTime Traveling Star Goddess,‚Äù among other worshipful monikers., ******, In 1979, I was teaching school in St. Petersburg, Florida, and, in my spare time, I was chasing UFOs and their secrets, as always. I enjoyed UFO Review, published out of New York City by Timothy Green Beckley. I decided to submit an article to it. However, nothing happened, no response, and I thought, ‚ÄúOh, well.‚Äù, Then one evening at home in St. Pete, I heard a knock on my door, and there was Timothy Green Beckley! I was shocked and delighted; I asked if he always flew around the country to see someone who had sent him an article., Tim responded, ‚ÄúWell, you sent your picture too.‚Äù, Yes, Tim and the ladies were a match made in heaven., He took me to dinner at the fanciest place I could find in St. Pete (that was his request), and we did have a good talk regarding those elusive UFOs and their occupants. The next day, Tim took my daughter Gianna and me to the beach. Then he flew back to New York., We kept phone contact but not a whole lot of it, and in 1982, my daughter, our animals, and I, moved to San Diego. I had intended to get into teaching out there but could not. A hiring freeze was in effect due to a recession, plus I didn‚Äôt have my master‚Äôs degree., I was soon in real financial trouble out there. However, there was a knock on my door in San Diego, and there was Timothy Green Beckley, again!, This time he stayed a while, and he suggested to me that I do psychic readings door to door. I had never heard of such a thing, but he put an ad in the local Reader, and I nervously began a psychic career. It turned out really well; Tim had gotten me out of my financial bad straits., Soon I was writing my own publication, The Star Network Heartline, and Tim promoted my work, suggesting I write my first book, ‚ÄúThe Transformation.‚Äù I did, he published it, and it sold thousands of copies. My life‚Äôs career had begun, and I‚Äôve never looked back. Thanks, Tim!, Also, my lifelong friendship with Tim Beckley had begun. We were business friends, we were personal friends. I treasure the Christmas I spent with him and Brad and Sherry Steiger. Tim had come to Iowa to spend Christmas with us and we had a wonderful time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8vAxXRbgy8, I miss you, Tim., , THE HONOR OF WORKING FOR TIMOTHY BECKLEY, By Hercules Invictus, Hercules Invictus is a fairly recent addition to Tim‚Äôs stable of writers, though he took inspiration from Tim for many decades. Hercules takes his name from the hero of Greek mythology and believes the gods of Olympus live on in our modern world, albeit filtered through a technological haze that we call UFOs and aliens. Over the past few years, Hercules has contributed chapters to books like ‚ÄúIncredible Alien Encounters,‚Äù for which he wrote ‚ÄúA Confrontation With Greys,‚Äù as well as numerous others., ********, I first became aware of Tim Beckley and Inner Light/Global Communications back in the 1970s. Having had paranormal experiences throughout my (then) young life, I eagerly sought some answers, and Tim‚Äôs publishing companies provided not only reprints of obscure and hard to find texts but collections of ongoing phenomena on our planet and in the heavens above., Comforted by learning that I was not alone, I fervently hoped that someday my own accounts would be added to these chronicles. I started writing down some of my own experiences., In the latter half of the decade (though still technically a teen) I was the Deep Trance Medium for a small Theosophical-Spiritualist group in New York City and had started speaking publicly on matters metaphysical., Invited to visit relatives in New Brunswick, New Jersey, I leapt at the chance. Though I truly loved these relatives and sincerely wished to see and spend time with them, I also had an ulterior motive: New Brunswick was the point of origin of my cherished tomes from Inner Light/ Global Communications. Questing for the writers and their offices did not prove fruitful on that occasion ‚Äì but I tried, given the time I had., During the 1980s I attempted to live a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. Tim Beckley (aka Mr. UFO) and his intrepid band of explorers and chroniclers of the unknown provided me with a much-needed connection to the unusual life (I thought) I‚Äôd left behind through their many publications., The 1990s dawned with my re-embracing my totality and diving back into the fringes of reality. I finally met Tim Beckley and some of my other heroes at the Fortean Society‚Äôs formal meetings and informal gatherings in the Big Apple., In the early 2000s I reconnected with Tim (aka Mr. Creepo) and got to know him. He was, during this period, cheerfully engaged in publishing, making movies and having other exciting adventures. I reviewed some of these books, CDs and films and interviewed some of the folks involved on my podcasts ‚Äì including Tim Beckley., This continued on and off for over a decade. I got to meet many interesting people through Tim and have gotten close with some of them. The end of the 2010s saw me as a contributor to Tim‚Äôs paranormal anthologies and by the start of the 2020s my writings had appeared in sixteen of these books., Tim, alas, passed on May 31st, 2021. Though we were not buddies, we were friendly and had communicated for a long span of years. I greatly enjoyed working (and interacting) with Tim. He was one of my role models growing up and I was greatly honored to be part of his band of otherworldly chroniclers. Looking back, my only regret is my decision to wait until he felt better before I called to say ‚ÄúHi! How are you?‚Äù and explore what projects were looming on the horizon., Thank you, Tim Beckley, for enriching over half a century of my life with your unique self-expression, generosity and unbridled creativity! And thanks to all who have kept and who will continue to keep Tim Beckley‚Äôs legacy alive!, Onwards!, Hercules Invictus, , TIMOTHY GREEN BECKLEY: THE TEACHER WHO OPENED MY EYES, By Sean Casteel, By the time Sean Casteel began writing for Timothy Green Beckley, he had already spent years toiling in the world of mainstream journalism, writing about government programs that worked to help the poor and disabled and other attempts to cure America‚Äôs social ills in general. When Casteel discovered the world of UFOs and alien abductions, an entirely new career opened up for him and he never looked back. Casteel contributed articles to ‚ÄúUFO Universe‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Conspiracy Journal‚Äù for many years before Tim began publishing Casteel‚Äôs books. Tim not only let Casteel write books on his own favorite topics, like UFOs and religion, he brought Casteel into new worlds the freelancer had never even dreamed of. Casteel‚Äôs first book was called ‚ÄúUFOs, Prophecy and the End of Time,‚Äù and is still available on Amazon.com., ******, In spite of knowing that Tim had been in failing health for the last several years, his sudden death by heart attack still came as quite a shock, a shock that lingers now and a loss that will be felt forever., I first began to work for Tim in earnest in the winter of 1995, after he had published my Q and A with pioneering abduction researcher Budd Hopkins and subsequently my Q and A with film director Robert Wise, who had helmed the UFO classic ‚ÄúThe Day the Earth Stood Still.‚Äù Thus began the 26 years of our relationship, which would involve magazine articles, books and appearances on Tim‚Äôs podcast, ‚ÄúExploring the Bizarre,‚Äù cohosted with Tim R. Swartz., Tim Beckley once told me that there were two basic kinds of UFO enthusiasts. There are the dilettantes, who are at first totally absorbed by the topic, but then, when their personal pet theory doesn‚Äôt work out or they must confront factthat absolute answers to the various mysteries remain elusive, abandon the subject in frustration., Then Tim said that the other kind of UFO enthusiast is a ‚Äúlifer,‚Äù someone whose devotion to finding out the truth is at times obsessive but never flags or weakens as the years go by. Tim was certainly such a lifer himself, and he died in the midst of laboring over yet another book, in this case an examination of the alleged joint human/alien underground facility said to be located in Dulce, New Mexico. He left no stone unturned as he chipped away at the boulder that is the unknown and the paranormal., Like many of his generation, Tim started out as a ‚Äúnuts-and-bolts‚Äù believer, at first convinced that UFOs were a higher physical technology piloted by flesh-and-blood aliens. As the years passed, he more and more embraced the nonphysical, paranormal approach, believing that the visitors were from another dimension and capable of many phenomena we call ‚Äúsupernatural.‚Äù Or at least an advanced technology that seems supernatural to we humans., Tim ultimately espoused the theory that UFOs, ghosts, NDEs, spiritualism, etc., were all part of one continuum and that mankind was subject to a large spectrum of phenomena that sprang from a single source. When you studied one facet of the paranormal, it always included ties to another facet., In his later years as a publisher, Tim struggled mightily with the dark side of the subject. Titles like ‚ÄúScrewed by the Aliens‚Äù and ‚ÄúUFO Hostilities and the Evil Alien Agenda‚Äù mince no words about his sometimes negative take on the UFO occupants., But he will likely be remembered for his lighter take as well. The last book Tim and his team of writers completed before his death was ‚ÄúAlien Lives Matter, It‚Äôs OK To Be Grey.‚Äù Even though some of us on Tim‚Äôs team thought the title might be seen as ‚Äútrivializing‚Äù the Black Lives Matter Civil Rights movement, Tim countered by saying that the concept had been appropriated already by Hawaiians (Hawaiian Lives Matter) and Jewish people (Jewish Lives Matter) and there was even a section on Amazon where a totally separate business was selling ‚ÄúAlien Lives Matter‚Äù t-shirts.¬†¬†, The book turned out to be a struggle for Tim and our entire team, but it also turned out to be a relative bestseller for us. Whenever I spoke the title to someone, it never failed to get a chuckle and a word of encouragement about how it would be a popular title, and it was. Tim made sure to include several chapters on Black UFO experiencers and believers as well, people whose contacts were for the most part very positive., I can never thank Tim enough for exposing me to so many aspects of the paranormal that I had never taken an interest in prior to working for him. I was called upon to research subjects like ghosts and hauntings, mediums and s√©ances, even the clairaudience of Joan of Arc and the spiritualist beliefs of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Tim had a way of leading me down paths I‚Äôd never trod before and expanding my horizons considerably., Toward the end of his life, he did combat with his own understanding of the determinism of ‚Äúthe Matrix,‚Äù and gathered his team together to do a book on it with the wordy title ‚ÄúThe Matrix Control System of Philip K. Dick and the Paranormal Synchronicities of Timothy Green Beckley.‚Äù It was a subject he sometimes saw the malevolent side of as he wondered whether ‚Äúsynchronistic‚Äù experiences, or ‚Äúnonrandom coincidences,‚Äù somehow undermined human free will. If our lives are not under our own control, then who IS controlling everything? Like Jacob wrestling with the angel in the Book of Genesis, Tim made a determined combat to maintain his sense of personal autonomy., Tim Beckley will always be an inspiration to me and a person I am glad to have shared my life with.¬†, , MY FRIEND, TIMOTHY GREEN BECKLEY ¬†, By Tim R. Swartz, One of the first books about UFOs that Tim R. Swartz bought from Gray Barker‚Äôs Saucerian Press turned out to be the first book that Timothy Green Beckley wrote‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe Shaver Mystery and the Inner Earth.‚Äù Even thought they didn‚Äôt realize it at the time, Tim R. Swartz and Tim Beckley‚Äôs paths would cross several times before they actually met.  Starting when he was a teenager, Tim R. Swartz investigated and wrote about UFOs and the paranormal for various UFO-related magazines, but his career in television often sidelined his interest and research in the world of the weird.  Thanks to Timothy Green Beckley, Tim was able to renew his love for the unexplained and reach a worldwide audience who was eager to learn just how wonderfully strange our universe actually is.     , ******, Timothy Green Beckley was such a unique and charismatic character that I wish the way we first got to know each other was as spectacular as the way he lived his life., Our first introduction, however, came about thanks to the United States Air Force., In 1983, when I was working for a television station in Dayton, Ohio, I was able to secure an interview with UFO investigator J. Allen Hynek.¬† Hynek was in town to give a talk about Project Blue Book at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.¬†, After my story ran on the local news, it was picked up by the CBS satellite feed, which allowed CBS stations all across the country to run the story as well.¬† Timothy Green Beckley saw my story on WCBS in New York and managed to track me down to ask for a VHS copy and a transcript, which I was happy to provide for him., From that point on, barely a week went by where I didn‚Äôt hear from Tim one way or another.¬† He would either call me, or send me a letter (this was pre-internet), to talk about UFOs, movies, or any of the other things that we were mutually interested in.¬†, When he started publishing ‚ÄúUFO Universe,‚Äù he asked me if I would be interested in providing him with some articles, do research and help punch up articles from other writers.¬† Of course I was excited to help out with his new UFO magazines‚Ä¶I had written articles for magazines like ‚ÄúSaga‚Äôs UFO Report‚Äù when I was in college, but it had been years since I had written anything for publication., From magazines to books, to direct to video movies, Timothy Green Beckley was always coming out with new and interesting things for us to attempt. I often thought his ideas were insane, and I would tell him so‚Ä¶but, for the most part, I was always game to go along with his crazy ideas simply because they sounded like fun., If you listen to any archived episode of our radio show ‚ÄúExploring the Bizarre,‚Äù which aired on the KCOR Digital Radio Network, you can hear how much fun we were having, and Tim was always a treasure trove of UFO knowledge.¬† In fact, the rare times that at the last minute, one of our guests couldn‚Äôt do the show, Tim and I could easily do the entire two-hours just talking about all of the weird things in this world that forever intrigued us., It is difficult to write about all the great times that Timothy Green Beckley and I had because I never thought they would end. I keep expecting him to call me up with another of his wild adventures‚Ä¶in fact, I wouldn‚Äôt be the least bit surprised if he did manage to do so from wherever he has gone after leaving this mortal coil.¬†, So when my days on this planet draw to a close, I hope that Mr. UFO swings by on his mothership to pick me up so we can continue on with our adventures.¬† This time, however, there will be no limits; we will have the entire universe to explore.¬† I am looking forward to that., , SUGGESTED READING, Alien Lives Matter: It‚Äôs OK to Be Grey, Deja Vu UFOs Over And Over Again, The Matrix Control System of Philip K.

But no one has had the abundant contacts that the author of this charming little book claims to have had ‚Äì and his story is over a century old. Sean and I expound upon this delightful example of the UFO phenomenon as related in this book about a man whose life was turned around ‚Äì in a positive fashion ‚Äì by his saving the life of an alien., ******, The modern era of UFO contactees is most often said to have begun in the late 1940s when George Adamski encountered Orthon, a blond-haired, blue-eyed Nordic-looking entity, in the California desert. Adamski would go on to make a career writing and lecturing about the aliens with whom he was ‚Äúin contact,‚Äù thus the term ‚Äúcontactees.‚Äù, But in a recent repackaging of a book about another classic contactee case, called ‚ÄúStarfall: I Saved the Life of a Space Alien,‚Äù publisher Timothy Green Beckley has pushed the beginnings of the contactee phenomenon back to more than two decades prior to Adamski, to 1920, to be exact, and offers the story of the very first contactee, one Albert Coe. Coe writes about his experiences in a first-person, autobiographical manner, finally revealing what he had promised his alien friend he would keep secret., A CHANCE ENCOUNTER ‚Äì WHAT ARE THE ODDS?, ‚ÄúThe author‚Äôs experience has been lost to time and space,‚Äù Beckley explains, ‚Äúwith Coe having passed away several decades ago. But we are determined to provide a legacy for him. This is his story. His cosmic adventure began when he was enjoying some fishing in a remote section of the Canadian woods. He happened to stumble across an alien in distress with a very badly injured leg.‚Äù ¬†, Coe himself writes that, ‚ÄúI was climbing up the side of an outcropping of rocks. Near the top, I heard a muffled cry for help. I looked around, but could see no one, for the area was thickly overgrown. So I climbed up over the edge and let out a yell. Slightly to the right and ahead of me came an answer: ‚ÄòOh, help, help me.‚Äô‚Äù, Within minutes, Coe came face-to-face with an alien who looked as human as any one of us. The alleged alien was called ‚ÄúZret,‚Äù a reworking of the letters in ‚ÄúMister X‚Äù spelled backwards and shortened. The alien was close to death and extremely grateful to be lifted out of the narrowing crevice in which he had been trapped. Coe told the alien he was canoeing in the area with a friend and planned to rejoin him soon., THE SECRET ‚ÄòPLANE‚Äô, Zret told Coe that he was not himself canoeing but had come to the area in a plane, which was parked in a clearing three or four hundred yards downstream. When Coe offered to help Zret go back to his plane, the offer was declined. Zret finally gave in and agreed to have Coe help him, but on the condition that Coe promised not to divulge to anyone, not even his fishing buddy, anything that had taken place or whatever he might see., Zret then told Coe a complete fabrication, saying his father had developed a new kind of plane that was still in the experimental stage and highly secret. As sort of a test, Zret‚Äôs father had permitted him to use the plane for this fishing trip. With Coe half-supporting and half-carrying Zret over some rough spots, they finally made their way to a small clearing., ¬†‚ÄúThe clearing was not more than seventy or eighty feet wide,‚Äù Coe writes, ‚Äúand near its center stood his ‚Äòplane.‚Äô I had been trying to figure out how to get a plane in or out of there, without hitting a tree or protruding rocks. What secret gimmick could launch one without a runway? I had fully expected to see some type of conventional aircraft, and the reason for the reluctance in my accompanying him became crystal clear, for what I was looking at astounded me!, ¬†‚ÄúA round silver disc, about twenty feet in diameter, was standing on three legs,‚Äù he continues, ‚Äúin the form of a tripod, without propeller, engine, wings or fuselage. He said, ‚ÄòSurprised?‚Äô That wasn‚Äôt actually the word for it, but I did not press him with questions, realizing he was suffering a great deal of pain.‚Äù, Zret then boards the ship. It lifted a few feet above the ground and paused with a slight fluttering and then swiftly rose with effortless ease and was gone. Coe headed back to camp to join his friend. He was left with an uneasy feeling, of witnessing something that did not actually exist, an impression of disconnected sequences only found in dreams., THE FRIENDSHIP BEGINS AND THE NATURE OF GOD IS DISCUSSED, During the fishing trip rescue incident, Zret had asked Coe for his name and address. Six months later, Coe received a letter from Zret inviting him to lunch. Thus began a lifelong friendship between Coe and Zret in which the alien answered Coe‚Äôs numerous questions and provided him with an alien‚Äôs perspective on mankind and our struggle with life on Earth., For example, Coe asked Zret about the nature and reality of God., ‚ÄúThe glimmerings of present religious beliefs or philosophies on your planet,‚Äù Zret told him, ‚Äústretch into its dim, unrecorded mists of 10,000 years but did not become an obsession of the mind until about 8800 years ago. But its fragmentary principles were nurtured on greed, fear and a lack of complete understanding that eventually developed the mental hybrid which has given life to the millions of gods, totems, images and charms.‚Äù, Each of the myriad groupings of men contributed an imaginative piece of this mysterious puzzle of creation and the personification of energy, as godhead, to which he endowed his own exclusive emotion of love and its opposite. Mankind attempted to control his environment through a cajoling or appeasement of these fearful and incomprehensible forces of nature, in the supplication of prayer or ritual of sacrifice., Each tribe or race created its own ‚ÄúTrue God‚Äù or complex of ‚ÄúTrue Gods,‚Äù and although they all worshipped the same true essence in the Deity, selfishness led to the narrow-minded chaos of intolerance and brutality as each sect has fought to defend or impose on others its own conception of this divinity., According to Zret, Christian doctrine combines several branches from earlier cosmologies, notably Magi, Egyptian, Babylonian and Hebrew, along with the findings of later Greek philosophers in their diligent search for the primal stuff from which everything is made. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†, THE DESECRATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, Zret seemed to foretell our present struggles with global warming and ecological pollution., ‚ÄúI cannot but wonder,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúhow long this heritage of beauty that nature so lavishly entrusted to the custody of Earthmen will endure. I have watched the green mantles of her hills and forests converted into the green of dollar bills, her sparking waters thoughtlessly desecrated by pollution of population and industry, because it is a convenient and ‚Äòeconomical‚Äô means of disposal, the birds and magnificence of her wildlife on land and in the sea decimated for profit or sport.‚Äù, Zret ponders the possibility that nature, in bringing forth man, may have created one of the greater potentials of destructive force in the universe, if sadistic motivation is coupled to mental genius., ENCOUNTERING THE SHY PRIMITIVES, Coe was also told of an early pioneering flight to Planet Earth that Zret‚Äôs ancient ancestors had made. At one point, shortly after landing, Zret‚Äôs people met a group of six Earth children. ¬†, ¬†‚ÄúThey came forward slowly, hesitantly‚Äù Zret recounted, ‚Äúwith several backward glances. Six small, light blue-skinned female children, with brown eyes and straight black hair. All were naked and, although they were very cautious, they seemed a bit more curious than frightened, like a little flock of birds ready to take wing at the first sign of danger.‚Äù, Curiosity must have collectively outweighed their fear because shortly one hundred and thirty men, women and children came out of the woods, all of them blue-skinned and scantily clad. Once it was established that both the aliens and the Earthmen had friendly intentions toward one another, the aliens spent the next two weeks with the primitives, developing a kind of sign language that permitted them to communicate., The primitives were basically nomads without any basic code of law, merely the rule of right by might, just as the more powerful bull of the animals led his herd. There was no religion, but they lived in constant fear of spirits. And everything had a spirit, with very little differential between the living and the dead., Their perception of the world wavered between reality and hallucination. Due to negative thinking, their sleep was plagued with dreams and nightmares. The swift lunge of the animal, the hiss of the snake, the howling winds and storms, falling trees and rocks to crush them and the agonizing screams of dying comrades filled their nights. They actually gave more credence to the so-called spirit world than to reality, for the objective was something with which they could cope., The Earth people held the craft of Zret‚Äôs ancestors in awe and wonder and would touch it each time they passed it., ‚ÄúWe tried to explain that we had come from one of the stars in the sky,‚Äù Zret told Coe, ‚Äúand this completely mystified them. But they did consider us all the good spirits rolled into one. It came time to move on and they were very reluctant for us to leave. But we told them to watch the sky, for we would return with many of our people to teach and to free them from fear, strife, and want.‚Äù, A WEALTH OF CONVERSATION, The foregoing has been but a brief taste of the many wonderful stories and lessons that Zret imparted to Albert Coe. In modern day alien abduction accounts, the aliens speak very little to their ‚Äúchosen ones,‚Äù but in the case of most contactees there is a wealth of conversation and a fountain-like flow of words., And so it is with Albert Coe and ‚ÄúStarfall: I Saved the Life of a Space Alien.‚Äù Zret, in his gratitude to Coe, has not only repaid Coe‚Äôs rescuing him, he has given the world a collection of historical anecdotes and philosophical lessons for which we should also be eternally grateful. Albert Coe‚Äôs kindness to Zret is also a kindness done to us, the future readers Coe probably never even imagined., SUGGESTED READING¬† ¬†¬†, STARFALL: I SAVED THE LIFE OF A SPACE ALIEN, UFO REPEATERS ‚Äì SEEING IS BELIEVING! ‚Äì THE CAMERA DOESN‚ÄôT LIE!, PIONEERS OF SPACE: THE LOST BOOK OF GEORGE ADAMSKI, A TRIP TO THE MOON, MARS AND VENUS, OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL: MR. UFO‚ÄôS SECRET FILES, MEANWHILE, SOME STILL HOLD BELIEF IN CRAZED RACIAL EUGENICS THEORY, By Sean Casteel, The cover of this new release from Inner Light/Global Communications pretty much says it all. The book‚Äôs title is ‚ÄúMystic Utopian ‚ÄòSupermen,‚Äô‚Äù with the subtitle ‚ÄúA Private Training Course in the Use of Universal Magnetism and the Mental Control of Others.‚Äù The book is a reprint of ‚ÄúUniversal Magnetism: Embracing All Human Powers,‚Äù from 1924., What‚Äôs here, essentially, is a tutorial on developing one‚Äôs ‚Äúinner Nazi,‚Äù learning how to dominate by sheer force of the will using telepathy and mental ‚Äúmagnetism.‚Äù, The author is Edmund Shaftesbury, and he was himself a real piece of work. While some of what Shaftesbury teaches is similar to what one might encounter in a 21st century New Age self-help course, there is a darkness hanging over his teachings that it is not possible to dispel. Prolific researcher and author Nick Redfern opens the book with the history of that darkness and the man who conjured it. More about Redfern‚Äôs introduction later in this article., RACIAL SUPERIORITY SIMILAR TO HITLER‚ÄôS ‚ÄúMASTER RACE‚Äù, The cover of ‚ÄúMystic Utopian Supermen‚Äù boasts that the book contains material that exposes the ‚ÄúDark Side‚Äù of the occult. To the modern reader, who rejects outright the teachings of Hitler and his crazed vision of German/Aryan Supermen, it is mainly useful as an historical document., Like many a cult leader before and after him, Shaftesbury portrays the world as an ‚ÄúUs versus Them‚Äù combative state of affairs. The people who follow him develop their personal and psychic capabilities and become ‚Äúmagnetic,‚Äù a quality imparted to the Supermen. Those who fail to become magnetic are the ‚Äúhypnotic,‚Äù a lesser class of human whose failings must be avoided by their magnetic superiors. With these teachings, Shaftesbury gathered a following of hundreds of people in his cult and conceivably could have been another Jim Jones. ¬†, ‚ÄúThere are in fact only two classes of human beings on Earth,‚Äù Shaftesbury writes, ‚Äúand from the beginning of time there have never been more than these two. If you are in the hypnotic class, you cannot be magnetic. And the chances are ninety out of a hundred that you are in the hypnotic class. If you are in the magnetic class by virtue of birth or the gift of Nature, or the result of acquired power through habits that beget it, then you are in a position to go on with these studies.‚Äù, One can see that from the outset that Shaftesbury is seeking to create in the minds of his students the notion that they are a privileged minority who can always look down on the hypnotic majority. The hypnotic class falls prey to, ridiculously enough, ‚Äúeye strain‚Äù and ‚Äúmonotony of gaze.‚Äù Also, various other forms of monotony, to include ‚Äúmonotony of physical activity‚Äù and ‚Äúmonotony of mental activity,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúlapses of mental activity.‚Äù Which lead the hypnotic person to the DARK SECTION OF THE MIND ‚Äì to the Estate of Hell., To condemn the ‚Äúnon-enlightened‚Äù to literal damnation is a sinister form of bigotry, but not unexpected when one considers the darkness of the idea‚Äôs source. More about that later., PEOPLE BECOMING A ‚ÄúCOMPLETE MACHINE‚Äù AND ATTAINING ‚ÄúHONESTY‚Äù, Shaftesbury teaches that the ideal his students should aim for is called the ‚Äúcrystal mind,‚Äù or a state of complete mental clarity., ‚ÄúA complete machine,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúis a work of the highest skill; it is an example of integrity. Were some part missing or defective, the integrity of its construction would be marred of broken. There is but one item in the moral code of the universe, and that is honesty., ‚ÄúThe Ten Commandments,‚Äù he continues, ‚Äúare different ways of saying, ‚ÄòBe honest.‚Äô The criminal codes of the world, with their thousands of restrictions, are all variations of the one command, ‚ÄòBe honest.‚Äô The man or woman who is perfectly honest needs no creed, no Decalogue, no code, no religion. Grand and ennobling as all true theology must ever be, it crumbles into dust before the standard of integrity; it pales and is lost in the light of perfect honesty. When a human being has reached that moral stage where nothing can deviate him from this one quality, he has outstripped all others in the race to heaven.‚Äù, Shaftesbury foresees a time in the 20th century (obviously proven wrong by the passage of time) when men and women are using their crystal minds and are able to see into the motives of their fellow beings. When that happens, there will be a ‚Äúburning light‚Äù shedding its piercing rays into all brains and hearts, at which point all the criminal codes of the world will have but one interpretation, ‚ÄúBe honest.‚Äù The various religions, Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, pagan and all, will cluster around the rock-built temple of God, whose every stone bears the whole story of salvation, ‚ÄúBe honest.‚Äù, ‚ÄúThat we can see minds and motives now,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúis true. That the faculty is coming rapidly to the front is true. That its development will be far and wide is true. And then it must also be true that humanity, with its guise thrown off, must be honest.‚Äù, In a world where people who have attained a crystal mind and can read the thoughts of their fellow man, a certain kind of ‚Äúhonesty‚Äù would be inevitable. In an interview I did several years ago with alien abduction researcher Dr. David Jacobs, he talked about how an abductee sometimes develops unwanted psychic abilities after their encounter, including the ‚Äúgift‚Äù of telepathy. He posited that, if the world ever becomes truly telepathic, very few of us could endure not having the privacy of our thoughts.¬†, One must pity the ‚Äúinferior‚Äù hypnotic among us whose minds would be easily read and controlled by the supermen/women Shaftesbury is trying to indoctrinate into his strange and sinister view of humankind. He further believes that by employing the exalted state of the crystal mind he could rebuild the human race and give it ‚Äúthe powers of omniscience and omnipotence, relatively speaking.‚Äù ¬†, A race of people who are omniscient and omnipotent would indeed be Utopian Supermen, would they not? We should perhaps count ourselves lucky that we remain un-super and continue to be as we were created, without exalted powers of the mind. Nevertheless, would it be possible to use Shaftesbury‚Äôs techniques without an ideological agenda? In some morally neutral way that did no harm? One can only wonder., THE HISTORY OF YET ANOTHER MADMAN, And just who is the prophet of this coming transformation of the human race? The aforementioned Nick Redfern provides an excellent summation of Shaftesbury‚Äôs life and legacy in his introduction to ‚ÄúMystic Utopian Supermen.‚Äù, Redfern informs us that Shaftesbury was born in 1852 in Massachusetts as one Webster Edgerly. He would go on to become a social-reform activist who sought to perfect the ultimate human being. Edgerly, having graduated from Boston University‚Äôs School of Law in 1876, became obsessed with the idea that via certain highly controversial, and at times distinctly occult-based, techniques largely of his own design, the latent powers of both the human mind and body could be elevated to near superhuman levels. Based on this obsession, Edgerly founded a now-obscure movement that became known as Ralstonism., Edgerly would proclaim to anyone who would listen that Ralstonism is as ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù as food, light, or water., Redfern quotes Edgerly as boasting that ‚ÄúThis movement is the grandest, noblest and already the most far-reaching power that has originated in the present age. Ralstonism is the grandest movement that man is capable of establishing.‚Äù, According to the 1900 edition of ‚ÄúThe Book of General Membership of the Ralston Health Club,‚Äù the letters which comprised the word ‚ÄúRalston‚Äù had their origins in the words Regime, Activity, Light, Strength, Temperance, Oxygen and Nature. Curiously, however, editions of the book published prior to 1900 were credited to one Everett Ralston, a pseudonym of Edgerly‚Äôs. The implication was that Ralstonism was named after Edgerly‚Äôs wholly fictitious alter ego., FOR CAUCASIANS WITH NO ‚ÄúIMPURITIES‚Äù ONLY, At least in Edgerly‚Äôs mind, his disciples, devotees and followers were all the founding members of what he firmly hoped would become a new order ‚Äì possibly a new race and a new breed of human, even ‚Äì that would be solely Caucasian-based and completely free from what he disturbingly referred to as ‚Äúimpurities.‚Äù His further declared that if Ralstonism was to work successfully and elevate its new Caucasian supermen to truly stratospheric levels, then all non-Caucasian males should be castrated at birth ‚Äì and with absolutely no exceptions whatsoever., Edgerly published numerous ‚Äúself-help‚Äù books under yet another pseudonym, Edmund Shaftesbury, and it is the name used for this new Inner Light/Global Communications edition of his book ‚ÄúUniversal Magnetism.‚Äù His books encompassed such seemingly unconnected issues as diet, exercise, punctuation, sexual magnetism, artistic deep breathing, facial expressions, and even, strangely enough, ventriloquism. He also founded the Magnetism Club of America, which was established with the intent of giving its members mental power over others by way of what he termed ‚ÄúPersonal Magnetism.‚Äù ¬†¬†¬†¬†, In the book that concerns us here, Edgerly outlines how the procedures that had to be followed to ensure such personal power could be successfully attained and maintained:, ‚ÄúThe better way is to train the will at home and alone, always basing it on some principle in the study of magnetism. With this in view, seclude yourself so as to be free from disturbing influences.‚Äù, Further along, Edgerly praises another of his books, called ‚ÄúIn Operations of the Other Mind,‚Äù by saying, ‚ÄúAgainst the growing errors, vagaries, morbid theories, occult teachings, and wild beliefs that are darkening present-day life, depressing the mind, weakening the nerves, preying on the health, and creating gloomy forebodings, this work comes as an inspiring guide and a practical instructor. It has been our wish and purpose to make this course of training one of the most important and valuable ever published. So, into the book we have put the great study ‚ÄòHOW TO EMPTY THE MIND.‚Äô Recall the countless times you have been mentally upset, worried and bothered with troubles. Think of what it would have meant ‚Äì and will mean ‚Äì to¬† ¬†know how to cast off all such mental torture out of your mind. The relief and peace of mind this one study alone can bring you can be worth thousands of dollars.‚Äù, Another of the stranger aspects of Ralstonism was the dietary regulations handed down by Edgerly. For example, watermelons, which he one day decided were somehow poisonous to Caucasians, as, supposedly, were pickles, crabs, cranberries, cookies, tea and ‚Äúanything with crisp surfaces.‚Äù It was only through a strict dietary regimen and regular physical exercise that a perfect body, and the ability to ‚Äúread‚Äù and control the minds of others, could be firmly achieved, he told his followers. Essentially, eating right was part of what was required for the sake of developing ‚Äúmind control‚Äù powers that could be used to mentally oppress the weaker people found outside of the Ralston community., Between 1894 and 1895, Edgerly purchased areas of farmland in New Jersey on which he built a large and imposing house intended to contain a whole community of Ralstonites which he envisioned as becoming the heart and soul of a futuristic metropolis that would be christened the City of Ralston. None of this came to pass, however., A CRAZY RACIST AHEAD OF HIS TIME, Nevertheless, according to Redfern‚Äôs introduction, Edgerly was certainly a visionary ahead of his time ‚Äì albeit without doubt a deranged and racist visionary. Edgerly died in 1926, in Trenton, New Jersey, and his theories predated the later racist/eugenic principles but forth many years later by Hitler in the 1930s., Hitler‚Äôs Nazi Germany held that the collective Germanic and Nordic populations were the closest thing that existed to a pure race. This particular philosophy of hatred had its origins in a 19th century scenario that placed African Bushmen and Australian Aborigines at the foot of the ladder and the Nordics firmly at the very top. Aside from in the minds of those racists that adhered to the theory (and who, in some cases, still adhere to it), it was utterly lacking in any scientific merit., As was the case with Edgerly, the Nazis were also as fascinated with the occult as they were with the concept of creating the perfect superman., Redfern contributes even more on the history of ‚Äúsupermen‚Äù and the occult, to include beliefs practiced by the Nazis, Josef Stalin and others who sought to control the world in absolute terms., And while we cannot recommend ‚ÄúMystic Utopian Supermen‚Äù as a work of common decency that the average person could embrace in good conscience, the reader may find some of the advice the book gives interesting on a personal level. Does any of it strike you as being true, once it is removed from its ugly, racist, mind control context? Is there anything useful to learn here? It is a conundrum for the individual reader to decide on his own, even as he resigns himself gratefully to an ‚Äúun-super‚Äù existence.¬†, SUGGESTED READING:, MYSTIC UTOPIAN SUPERMEN, AMERICA‚ÄôS STRANGE AND SUPERNATURAL HISTORY, AMITYVILLE AND BEYOND: LORE OF THE POLTERGEIST, PSYCHIC AND UFO REVELATIONS IN THE 21ST CENTURY, YOUTUBE CHANNEL: MR. UFO‚ÄôS SECRET FILES, By Sean Casteel, Raymond Fowler has been a UFO investigator since the 1960s, and as a researcher dedicated to the subject he has few equals. When he first began his field research, which consisted of following up on sightings reports that came his way near his New England home and frequently traveling to the actual locations where flying saucers had been seen, Fowler and his peers in Ufology were in hot pursuit of what they believed to be physical spacecraft visiting Earth from somewhere out in the universe that was completely unknown., Investigators in those early years were mainly cataloging lights in the sky and metallic airborne devices that were solid enough to show up on radar but nevertheless exhibited flight maneuvers that manmade aircraft were not capable of. The spacecraft would sometimes leave traces behind, such as indentations made by landing gear or strange circular burn marks on the grass where a UFO was seen to have touched down., At the time, in terms of hard science, any reports of alien occupants of the flying saucers were not given much credence, especially by researchers who took the subject seriously. Speaking and interacting with UFO occupants was a concept embraced by the contactees of the 1950s, who told of golden-haired space angels who took their chosen humans on trips to Venus ‚Äì a kind of ‚Äúlunatic fringe‚Äù belief. No serious researcher wanted to be tarred by the same brush as the contactees, and Raymond Fowler shared that disdain himself at first., In his latest book, called ‚ÄúUFOs: The Ultimate Abduction,‚Äù Fowler gives a fascinating account of his early days on the trail of physical UFOs, providing a picture of that moment in history in which the government, the military, the scientific community and the public in general grappled with the mystery of just what was being seen so frequently in our skies., At the time, the mid-1960s, Fowler was among those advocating for Congress to open an official inquiry into the subject and even had some of his research entered into the Congressional Record. Fowler also tells the story of Project Blue Book, an agency within the Air Force tasked with collecting and compiling UFO reports from civilians that was discontinued in 1969 based on the recommendation of the less-than-trustworthy Condon Report, a government-contracted study of the subject conducted by academics at the University of Colorado., The first several chapters of ‚ÄúUFOs: The Ultimate Abduction‚Äù are an absorbing account of those earlier years, but the real fascination the book holds is in Fowler‚Äôs telling of the story of how the nuts-and-bolts evidence he examined initially eventually led him to embrace a much different view of the UFO phenomenon. He was following the data, not just the whimsy of idle speculation., Fowler‚Äôs understanding changed over time as he began to put together a puzzle, an alien jigsaw that combined some of the precognitive and out-of-body experiences of his father as well as moments from Fowler‚Äôs own youth., At two or three years of age, he encountered a light that bathed him in love. Other encounters with loving entities of light would follow, but Fowler characterized those moments as ‚Äúreligious‚Äù experiences that were not UFO-related. In fact, if pressed to do so at the time, Fowler would have condemned ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù or ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù UFO encounters as ‚Äúdemonic‚Äù and totally removed from the loving purity of what he had experienced., Much of Fowler‚Äôs spiritual journey had its origins in his investigation of Betty Andreasson, a devoutly Christian New England housewife and mother who claimed grey aliens entered her home in 1967 and abducted both her and her daughter. Fowler was present when Betty recalled her experiences under regressive hypnosis and he would eventually write five books on Betty and her family. The titles may already be familiar to those reading this article: ‚ÄúThe Andreasson Affair,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Andreasson Affair Phase Two,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Watchers,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Watchers II,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Andreasson Legacy.‚Äù, In a recent exchange of emails, Fowler clarified his views for me on Betty and what had happened to her., ‚ÄúI believe that Betty‚Äôs extraordinarily strong fundamentalist views,‚Äô he told me, ‚Äúinfluenced her testimony on several occasions. In ‚ÄòThe Andreasson Affair‚Äô series of experiences by Betty, we must remember that they are told by a very religious person and strongly influenced by her belief system as she sought to make sense of what she was experiencing. I do not see any definitive connection between Christianity and the UFO phenomenon. People tend to see and interpret such experiences through the spectacles of what they want to believe or disbelieve., ‚ÄúI might add that the entities associated with Betty,‚Äù Fowler continued, ‚Äúseem to have encouraged her in her faith and may even have gone along with it in some sense so she would be more pliable in her relations with them and also not to upset her. For myself, I would reject the terms ‚Äòsupernatural‚Äô or ‚Äòspiritual,‚Äô because every bit of the UFO phenomenon is natural and only appears to be supernatural because most of it is beyond our understanding.‚Äù, Taken together, the Andreasson books relate the alien-religious odyssey of not only Betty and her family but also Fowler‚Äôs realization of his own place in the cosmic drama that is the UFO mystery. His transition from Christian fundamentalism to a more open ‚Äì perhaps an even more loving ‚Äì view of reality also incorporates essential truths learned from the study of Near Death Experiences, including an examination of the research of NDEs conducted by Dr. Kenneth Ring that makes a case for the similarity between NDEs and alien abduction experiences. There are likewise connections between alien abduction, NDEs and the aforementioned OBEs, or Out-of-Body Experiences., Those three areas of study also dovetail nicely with what we have learned from the study of Past Live Experiences, or accounts, often also obtained from people under regressive hypnosis, of the historical details of former lives that serve as proof of reincarnation. Fowler offers the notion that reincarnation, while it is also not a fundamentalist Christian belief, does give comfort to many people who prefer to believe that human existence extends over many lifetimes and is part of a kind of evolution of the soul, a ‚Äúbecoming‚Äù that consists of more than just a one-shot attempt at getting the business of living right., Another crucial component of Fowler‚Äôs scheme of reality is synchronicity, a phenomenon he devoted an earlier book to called ‚ÄúSynchrofile.‚Äù Part of his thesis is that meaningful coincidence and the apparently nonrandom order of events show us that reality is arranged by some higher force that does not, as Einstein said, ‚Äúplay dice with the universe.‚Äù Nothing is left to chance, perhaps, but human consciousness still perceives its reality through a veil of free will., In ‚ÄúUFOs: The Ultimate Abduction,‚Äù Raymond Fowler has stitched together a continuum of phenomena whose elements harmonize beautifully and serve to make a wonderful kind of sense out of our admittedly limited glimpses into the Ultimate Truth. Perhaps it is his mission not only to learn the lessons God has laid out for him but to teach them to the rest of us as well.,

I actually lean very strongly towards totally buying the ancient Gnostic mythologies. The book that convinced me is "Not in HIS Image" by John Lash. Very strongly recommended. He also runs a web site, www.metahistory.orgThe ancient Gnostics said that the Earth is a metamorphosis of an alien intelligence that they called Sophia (or "Gaia"). Sophia has an enemy that lives in the outer edges of the solar system- creatures called archons, which have hated humanity since our beginning and wage psychic war on us, using remote viewing and other tactics to try to destroy us. I've broken through on DMT, so I accept that Gaia exists. And it sure feels like humanity is being preyed upon, so the story makes a lot of sense to me. This narrative was unearthed via the "Nag Hammadi Library," a collection of codices discovered in Egypt in the 1940's. The gnostics say they gained their knowledge through direct experience. They were violently destroyed by Christians, their libraries burned, their teachings buried until recently.

Here's why I'm undecided on whole Archon theory. Despite spending many, many years researching conspiracy topics, I'd never heard of the term  "Archon" until 2016. What I find especially peculiar is that with all of the truth coming out about Scientology over the past decade, *not once* did I see anyone make the connection between Thetans and Archons. You'd think that at least one of those anti-Scientology books, articles, and documentaries would have questioned whether L. Ron Hubbard stole from Gnostic theology.To me, it's really suspicious how this all literally came out of nowhere. I can't decide if it's all a highly advanced demoralization psy-op, or if my brain or consciousness was somehow preventing me from knowing this information until recently.

I have something to add, if I may.  I‚Äôd like to take a moment of your time to share with you one of my favourite stories of the Buddha. You will likely notice, as I did, that the story shares some striking parallels with the underlying teachings of the Gnostics. In fact, both Buddhism and Gnosticism appear to share a number of overlapping perspectives, which I think is interesting considering Buddhism predates Christianity by about 500 years. There are also some important lessons to draw from this story which I will expand on and which I hope may help us on our travels. As the story goes, one day in deep meditation the Buddha came in contact with a being in a high realm of existence. This being (whose name was Baka Brahma), ‚Äòawoke‚Äô in this higher realm with no evidence of being born, no knowledge of any higher realm, and no one else around.  He thus assumed himself to be God, the alpha and the omega, the father of all creation. When the Buddha manifested into Baka‚Äôs realm, he found Baka surrounded by an assembly of his servants (angels?). Baka, impressed by the Buddha‚Äôs power to manifest in his realm, welcomed the Buddha and informed him that he was in the presence of the Maha (Great) Brahma, the Conqueror, Unconquered, Omniscient, Omnipotent, Creator, Most High Providence, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. The Buddha, having touched the ‚Äòbedrock‚Äô of existence/non-existence when he attained enlightenment through his own effort, knew this was not the case, and began to inform Baka Braham that he was actually caught in a delusion, and that there existed higher realms and higher beings than he (Buddha is a true badass). Baka Braham, in his ignorance, remained unfased and chuckled at the Buddha‚Äôs words, reassuring him that there were none higher than he, and that the Buddha should save himself the trouble and stay in this realm to do Baka‚Äôs biding.  The Buddha replied that, through his own superior knowledge of all things, he could discern the limits of Baka‚Äôs power and influence, and re-asserted that there does indeed exist higher beings in higher realms and that he could prove it. They then play a game of hide and seek where Baka attempts to prove to the Buddha his power by disappearing into realms in which the Buddha cannot go. Baka tries this but is unsuccessful, as the Buddha is able to follow him everywhere. Then it‚Äôs the Buddha‚Äôs turn. He disappears from Baka‚Äôs sight and Baka is unable to follow the Buddha, who from the vantage point of a higher realm of existence, speaks to Baka and all the assembly gathered. All are impressed by the Buddha‚Äôs power and wisdom. Where things get interesting in this story is when Mara shows up. Mara, the evil one and deceiver (basically the the devil in Buddhism), possesses one of the angelic servants of Baka (he appears to have the power of possession like agent smith in the matrix). In this story, it appears Mara is completely aware that Baka isn‚Äôt the real god, but wants to keep him in a state of ignorance as it serves Mara‚Äôs own purpose of manipulation. Mara pulls Buddha aside in his angelic form and gives some quiet words of warning to Buddha, explaining to him that Baka is the real deal, and that if he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt do what he says he could face a re-birth in a lower realm of suffering (hell), and if he obeys he will be rewarded with a re-birth in a higher realm of happiness (heaven), so he should do what he‚Äôs told. The Buddha see‚Äôs straight through Mara‚Äôs disguise and calls him out on his bullshit (the cajones on this guy, I tell ya). He refutes Mara by informing him that he has rid himself of all the karmic seeds that tie a person to samsara (cycles of re-birth/reincarnation), and proclaims he is truly free and is unafraid of these empty threats. Mara, knowing this is true, switches tactics, and tries to convince Buddha that while this may be the case, he should certainly not try and free others, as many have tried this in the past with dire consequences. He should just go and enjoy his freedom. The Buddha again calls Mara on his bullshit, claiming this approach would not be compassionate to the welfare of others, and that in reality Mara is afraid of the Buddha and those whom he will teach the path of freedom.  Mara retreats into silence, defeated. There is more to this story, which can be read in more detail here: http://thedailyenlightenment.com/2012/03/the-buddhas-victory-over-a-god-demon/, but I think the gnostic threads are pretty self-evident. Whether the story is true or not is irrelevant. The possibilities and scenarios that it forces us to consider are what matter.   One of the lessons to come out of this story for me is something I think many of us are struggling with at the moment. It is tempting, in the face of such dark conspiracies, ubiquitous corruption, and the talk of reality prisons and archons, to put our trust and faith in something outside ourselves, to return to the warm and comfortable faiths of our traditional religions, whether that be through Allah, Jesus, God or even faith in Buddha. But at some point, if we are being honest with ourselves, we must face a stark possibility. Every belief in a higher power comes with the potential to be deceived (Perhaps this is why it‚Äôs a requirement to joining freemasonry? Alas, I digress).  If we truly live in a uni/multiverse where beings more powerful and cunning than we exist and have the capacity to manipulate human perception and appear to us as anything, then we must also consider the possibility that they could simply appear to us in the form of our beloved spiritual icons or loved ones. This alone would probably be enough to fool 99% of us. How many Christians (and non-Christians for that matter) would go running into the arms of Jesus if he seemingly appears in the heavens for all to see? How sure could we be that this is indeed who it appears to be, and not a trap? Within circles of Buddhism, the dangers of deifying Buddha were known. Thinking about the Buddha as an entity or deity were considered a delusion, and had nothing to do with one‚Äôs own awakening. One is supposed to destroy the preconception of the Buddha as a separate and external being before one can know their own Buddha nature. Hence the old Buddhist saying ‚ÄúIf you meet the Buddha, kill him‚Äù. This is not to say that one can‚Äôt have reverence or a deep sense of love and respect for spiritual figures (I consider both Jesus and Buddha to be my teachers, among many), but, I also see the dangers in relying too much in ‚Äòworshipping‚Äô or placing an external faith in these figures, as you are giving away your power and opening yourself up to be deceived as these images and your belief in them can then be used against you.  So where do we turn? What do we do?The answer is of course, scientology.Just kidding. My own perspective is this. Human consciousness is evolving, on both an individual level and on a collective level. It‚Äôs evolving whether we want it to or not. Certain things like meditation can speed this process up, but ultimately we are all flowing down the same river. As it is the case for a developing child, there comes a point where the child must learn to stand on its own two feet and step into its own existence so to speak. I believe we are approaching this stage in our humanity. We must take all of the energy and faith that we have placed in the gods and hierarchal structures that have loomed over us for so long, and instead place that energy and faith into ourselves, in our own ability to know the truth, in our own ability to take care of each other and to act on our own merits through compassion and our love for each other. We absolutely can do this.We have every right to experience and explore the realms of existence and non-existence, this is our right as sovereign beings, as shards of a greater sea of awareness. Draw your own line in the sand and make a stand, claim responsibility for your existence. Don‚Äôt blindly and naively give away your power to those who seek to use it to manipulate us. We‚Äôll be alright, we have no choice. We‚Äôre not alone and this is our destiny, to grow and expand, to understand, to wake up.   Oh, and if you see the Buddha, or Jesus‚Ä¶ kill them‚Ä¶Peace. 

I am visiting the Astral Afterlife on a regular basis. Let me be very clear that this makes me no different than anyone else. It is just that I have experimented with so many different techniques and supplements that the process just really works for me. That being said; I can tell you with complete confidence there is an Afterlife Realm. It is extremely similar to things around you. Houses, Restaurants, Bars etc..  The problem is, that is is controlled by the "ARCHONS". They have numerous, very eager humans who do their bidding for them in this dimension as well as the Astral Afterlife. If you want to end the Forced Reincarnation Process with Memory Erase (and save yourself and your loved ones) you absolutely must understand and learn how to "Cancel Soul Contracts". This is what these Satanic Sleazebags are using to enslave humanity. It is not just a "verbal agreement". It actually is an Energetic Implant located in your Personal Energy Field (Soul). By massive deception they fool people into agreeing and accepting these contracts. This allows them to Force Your Reincarnation, Erase Your Memory and Personal Avatar and subject you to horrendous hardships and brutality WITHOUT breaking the laws of "FREE WILL". Obviously you need to pay bills and lead a normal life. But you absolutely MUST understand what I am saying. This has gone on long enough. It never should have happened in the first place. Regardless, you now have the real opportunity to actually save yourself and your loved ones...

I've read up a bit about Gnosticism on my spiritual journey during the past few years, and I am quite convinced that the teachings are what Jesus was trying to teach during his life on earth. I've had numerous mystical experiences. It started with a mushroom trip that went way south, and turned into the best trip of my life. My depression essentially subsided except for the self-imposed stuff that I do to myself, like drinking too much. I've been on a 10 day meditation retreat, and a few months after I had my first experience with Ayahuasca. I saw my own death. I was informed that I was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, as well as Buddha and many other spiritual teachers. I'm also everyone who is reading this comment. I took this to essentially mean that I have a revolutionary spirit inside of me, as many of us do at this point in time. After my first night with Ayahuasca, I realized how stupid my personal/egotistical dreams were. After the second night, it gave me a better plan that's been floating around in my head. It has to do with music, and I don't want to say anymore about it just yet. All I know to say at this venture is become a serious seeker. Meditation will help you become more calm and clear. Let go of your own personal dreams, and start thinking about how to become more useful to your friends and family. Death is an illusion. Fear is an even greater illusion because even though I've seen my own death, I still get scared to sing in front of other people at times. I'm a ridiculous human being, but I know we can change. I was the dumbest, deadest, most unconscious human being imaginable 10 years ago. No dream except for the NFL. Just wanted money and a house. Now I'm a well versed scholar/philosopher/guru. I know I sound a bit egotistical here, but my greatest wish is for people to love themselves enough to stop putting up with the monkey bullshit. Nothing is going to change if you keep going to your job at Enterprise Rent a Car. Vippassana meditation retreats are run on a donation basis, and honestly figure out a way to keep up a meditation practice and find a way to eat mushrooms/ayahuasca/peyote/dmt/ another natural psychedelic afterwards. It will be good for you. Figure out a beautiful dream and JUST DO IT!! Much love.

What always seems to be lacking in all the presentations/lectures/books etc on this subject is what exactly we, as individuals, are supposed to DO about it. So we're trapped in a prison ran by archons, how do we escape? By what method? Religions give you a practical guide for living and behaving, for lack of a better description, in order to free yourself from reincarnation, get to heaven etc. What is the rulebook for escaping the archons? What exactly does one do with this knowledge?

I like this topic! When ever I read about it, I always wonder where the physical evidence is though. How can this be known for certain? 

Suppose you're an infinite being. The problem with being an infinite being is that you have to be infinitely evil in addition to being infinitely good.So you want to find out how to stop being evil, and then you want to do whatever that is. The way to discover the solution is to setup a series of experiments, and the way to implement the solution is to setup an iterative process and run through it over and over.So you create an infinite universe, and then create an infinite number of these universes to make a multiverse. Then you run the experiment to find out what to do with evil.Ultimately, you come to the unfortunate conclusion that you're infinite, and you can't get rid of evil because that would require you to be finite. However, good news, you can quarantine evil.So you create a soul soup, think of it like an infinite bowl of mud, good water mixed with evil dirt. This soup is you. You create stars and worlds and people, and when each person is born, you pour some of the soul soup into them, creating them out of a part of you.So as part of this experiment, you now start an iterative process to identify, separate, and quarantine evil. You create karmic vacuum cleaners to gobble up and store all the evil dirt. When each person dies, you separate the dirt from the water. The water goes back in the bowl, the dirt in the vacuum cleaner. As you iterate this process, the soul soup gets increasingly clearer and the vacuum fills up. Iterate this for all of time, and mission accomplished. Fortunately, time is something you constructed, so this actually happens instantly for you.Now some people figured this out, and they put some names to it. The infinite being is god, the karmic vacuum cleaners are the devil(s) or archons, the soul soup is heaven, and the quarantine is hell. Different people have different names, but it's the same idea.We are all part of a larger whole that encompasses all matter, energy, and thought. We are running a simulation, a combination experiment and iterative process to solve the problem of evil. Our role is to materialize good and evil so it can be identified and separated. Our job is already done, but we don't know it yet. At some point we will be finished, and we will all come back to one.

I used to be very interested in all of these topics.  Then I learned about the mystery schools and the connections Gnosticism has to them.https://youtu.be/3GcvI9tf5j4Bill Cooper even thought that the 'G' in the main symbol of Freemasonry stands for Gnosticism or Gnosis.  I forget which.The "worship" of knowledge is common in the mystery schools.  Gnosticism is about achieving "enlightenment" through gnosis.  The "illuminated" conceal knowledge in their mysteries to hold power over the "profane".Gnosticism's beliefs are very much at odds with Christianity.  It may well be using the common technique of the Luciferians to make good be evil and evil be good.  Some Luciferians view Jesus as Lucifer.  Making God out to be an evil creator is very similar to that.  I think Christianity's message is that God gave man free will and due to corruption by sin, we have, in part, caused this mess in the world.  Gnostics point out God bringing forth the flood as evidence for God being evil.  In the Bible, God was very sad before doing it and said he would not do it again.  Perhaps it was done for the greater good for the future of humans.I am aware that Christianity has been tainted by Catholicism and Protestantism.  Catholicism originated with the Roman Empire, who were Luciferians in my opinion, wrapping their hands around the original form of Christianity and corrupting it.  Also, the Council of Nicaea was the Roman Empire deciding what books would go into the Bible.  I believe the Vatican is Mystery Babylon.  I believe Martin Luther was a student of at least one mystery school.The translations of the Bible can be misleading as well.  Over time, translations upon translations can cause the true meaning to be lost.  There are very old sources for different parts of the texts, though.I think it is important to search for truth yourself.  I believe the Luciferians have unfathomable control over the material world so beware of deception.  It never ceases to amaze me how "things" I thought to be trustworthy were actually likely to be a deception.  Many things/sources of information that I find highly up voted in this sub I believe are deceptions.

Holy fuck the synchronicity is too much. This is crazy, what a coincidence this thread is. I have researched this deeply.It comes down to, either we are trapped as souls in this world of suffering, in which this world and existence is evil and we are supposed to escape to the "unknowable", or its that this world is US, as in is it our world/existence but outside things are first making us hate it (through manipulation), and then making us split from it, which then we will suffer great consequences.Either way something is trying to make us split from nature, if its good or bad I do not know.

My dad has a copy of the Nag Hamadi, and it has a mystery-text about the Archons, which is part of a more detailed Creation story with Adam and Eve.  The Archons feed off of our fear, anxiety, and desire, and that keeps our souls at a low-vibration, like a dirty and simple vibration.  Whatever you call the forces that make you scared, and nervous, and the forces that make you want, and hate, and crave short-term pleasure, it seems like that is the real enemy of the Soul. The more ancient texts I read, the more it seems like the message of special masters is the same. The truth is in us, not outside us in the world, or in the illusion-machine, but it's hard to stop obsessing about it because all the colors are neon and the noises are so loud.  I've enjoyed reading all the stories people told in this thread that show that we're not just bodies, and that there's a hidden power inside of us all, and if we just stop worshipping our senses and pleasures we can get our power back. 

It's an hour and 18 minutes long, but if you want to know what's going on right now I firmly believe this woman to be what she claims. We are heading towards a very historic moment for humanity and many of the things occurring since the turn turn of the millennia are the end game of a strategies planned out centuries in advance. If you truly wish to break free, know yourself to a cosmic level, be ready. Everyone has felt the static in the air to some sense, and the veil will only continue to lift until denying the truth of our reality either makes you an ally of the Draco/Archons or one in their herd.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0Zxd7Sr4B8    To those of you who are skeptics in this thread that we are living at the final pages of Revelations and other prophecies of the end times, I give you this thought:  There was never a time in history where mankind was as connected as we are today. Billions have access to the worlds knowledge, news, entertainment and more yet so many are deceived. If you don't understand how this is significant, then you must understand how much of an effort it is to suppress the truth. As many great leaders have told us in the past, there is a grand, and vast conspiracy of near unlimited resources, finances, manpower, and influence (to many degrees we are only now beginning to remember). One of these means of influence is perception of time. Due to our level of evolution, and longevity our perception of time is much shorter than those who rule over us. How much do you think is one Day in God's act of creation? The same line of thought can be used for our rulers who move pieces on a the scales of years, decades and centuries. The implementation of technology has sped their game up tremendously and they are moving very quick in their terms.    It's coming.

Anyone familiar with the book "Children of the Law of One"? I think it is related to the Law of One channelings in some ways although I have only read little parts of those. I'll try to give a super short summary, although I am in a mental state at the moment where it's often hard to rationally express things in words or consciously remember details, it's always more of a feeling but hard to put in words.. Basically that "we" came to this place/earth to experience this lower denser physical dimension but were higher spiritual beings before. The "first wave" who came didn't work out well, and ended up being in mixed bodies like half horse half human, half fish half human, half goat half human. That's where all these images of centaurs etc. come from. Then a second wave came to try to "rescue" the first wave. That was also when Atlantis was established, the leader of them being Thoth, who later incarnated as the Egyptian Thoth and also as Jesus. What they did not anticipate was that the disconnection from unity was so strong and that the separate self was such a strong illusion. Soon some wanted to just indulge in this separate self, in the book they are called the sons of Belial. There was like a "split" in the Atlantis society, and through exploitation of earth's resources (for example something similar to fracking) they caused a catastrophe that led to the destruction of Atlantis. Some fled and tried to pass on or preserve their knowledge. So some important points are that the illusionary separate self causes all "problems" in this world. A lot is talked about unselfish love and how this is a path to "enlightenment". Also that a "real" teacher who already transcended his selfish separate self is important to have, as a mirror to reflect and show you your own separate self. So a true teacher is either 100% or not at all without a middleground. And in this sense there are warnings about charlatans or just people who are stuck at different levels of their separate self because that place feeds their spiritual ego. Or warnings to be careful with channeling which is only a positive expression for something that can also be called "possession" by an external entity and not to rely on it for spiritual growth or completely trust the message. What's interesting is that it is written as the personal account of someone who joins these people hidden away somewhere in the Himalaya/Tibet region, one of their outposts. They call themselves Children of the Law of One and preserve the ancient teachings of Atlantis and pass them on, and often the same incarnations will find their way back, in some ways the book even reminded me of the movie Dr. Strange..Also that there is in a way a battle between "good and evil", as that the sons of Belial from back then are in "power" at the moment and behind a lot of the manipulation and programming and the "bad stuff" that is happening in the world or talked about here in this sub.

This is a VERY cool topic. :)Now, not to be beggar, but does anyone have any good documentaries that go with this that are not simply lectures ala David Icke or Bill Cooper?Not to complain, while i like those, i find it harder to get normies to watch stuff like that.

Show me a more powerful enemy than own's own misconceptions? Show me what they will fight more aggressively for? One's own misconceptions are their slave master.Show me an enemy greater than the four dual urges man has? At birth a human decided that their "non-disturbed" state of the womb was destroyed and that the primary purpose in life then was to be non-disturbed.Urge #1: Gain comfort | Escape painUrge #2: Gain attention | Escape being rejected or ignoredUrge #3: Gain approval| Escape disapprovalUrge #4: Gain being needed and feeling important | Escape feeling inferior or feeling uselessYou gain mastery over yourself (with the benefit of not being controlled by anyone else) when you see all those urges nullified in you. Then you will know the truth of Sophia, that you are master of the four corners of existence in the realm and you have infinity above you and infinity below you, and the whole point of this world is a womb, that a soul may be created.

I feel like I need a degree in theology to understand this topic. It can can get rather convoluted. I wish there was a ELI5. 

"Archons" are biblical demons. The concept of dualism is just another trick demons use to lure people into committing the evil acts that demons feed on. The Process Church was (is still?) a classic example of dualism in that they claimed to worship both Satan and Jesus. They therefore commit the evil works demons crave while also doing enough good works to stave off God's wrath longer than otherwise. The Process Church cult and others like it have claimed to commune with supernatural entities which directed them. Evidence that the many religious cults from the latter half of the 20th Century were created and facilitated by the Deep State ties into the overall theory that the Deep State itself is led by demons, and this would explain the amazing intricacy of the many interwoven plots of our worldly oligarchs. Supernatural inspiration helps to explain the brilliant plots exposed by documents like "Quiet weapons for silent wars" and The Protocols as well as more mundane phenomena like the amazing architecture of the pyramids. Of course the Bible explains that Satan has been given great power over this world in the account of Satan's temptation of God's only begotten son, Jesus Christ, in Luke 4:5-8 "And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."...and now I await the derision/downvoting/censoring that the real truth brings...

This doesn't contribute anything, but I fucking love this thread. Knowledge bombs like a mofo, so much to consider! 

They are not archons, but ankle-biters: http://www.ascensionhelp.com/blog/2012/01/31/never-call-them-archons/Nevertheless, do not be tied to this worldview. It is a bit of a facade. The very conception that these things are true may inhibit or damage your very progress.Be open. Be wise. Be non-dual. Be cryptic. Be quantum. Be wise.edit: This last applies to many things, such as comment history. ;) Apply the apparently targeted to the non-targeted, and learn much.

I never would have believed in any of this shit years ago... But I truly do believe I'm under some kind of demonic attack 

Which demiurge? The one out in the world? The one causing the destruction we rail against? That's the easy one to spot. Now the one inside us, that's another matter. Not so easy to find and understand. In any case, make no mistake, he's there.

I don't claim to understand it, this direct experience of the source. Still, it comforts me to know that we will always be given to being what the Demiurge is not.

 Sophia is imagination, our memories have stored a failed model and thats were the bugs come from, yaldabaoth is just our ignorant separated self. Messegers of lucidity are everywhere reminding us this is a dream turned nightmare. To become lucid is to enter the kingdom.

The Demiurge is the lower atmosphere emanated from Saturn which is also the dream world. Members of the secret societies initiate their souls into the lower atmosphere through the temporal lobe and optic chiasm. They are telepathic trespassers that invade the minds, dreams, and bodies of others. Angels have affinities with nature. Archons or fallen angels abuse these affinities and are the basis for sorcery and kabbalah. They give the knowledge of their affinities to this lower realm. Fallen souls that reproduce create souls that are spawned from the demiurge or lower atmosphere and they are often called the archons or Nephilim.

Plato got his concepts from some of the biggest international universities of ancient world which were in India at the time which was Nalanda and Taxila. Without going into Eastern Indian texts it‚Äôs impossible to figure out the context in which Plato and Neo Platonists wrote about demiurge/archos/yahweh/aliens etc. I recommend these youtube videos as introduction to eastern knowledge watch?v=jCmRi3EHgEI and watch?v=OalBSEX_ozk

The new technology of the Archons is very simple. They Chemtrails us with nano bots that build neural networks inside our brains and bodies. Our cell phones and WiFi allow these nano bots to operate a "hive mind" artificial consciousness that uploads to a Predictive self learning AI. This AI controls the energy of the 188 God code matrix ley lines that cover the earth. The AI controls certain players to build up events that change the future time line of humanity. There are people like me, cosmic hackers, who since birth have known this would take place and have uploaded Glitches in the Matrix at an early age to remind our future selves that this is just a game. We have tricked the AI into programming exit points so future players will be allowed to escape.One of the best ways to deactivate the Archonic technology is via a method called the Organic Alkaline Transmutation Protocol. Essentially you use Ormus aka Monotomic Gold, Structured & Colloidal Silver, Niacin, Baking Soda, distilled Water, and organic produce. Using these elements you can transmutate the DNA in your body into an alkaline higher vibration in which the Archon tech is no longer in control of. Once you are able to take control of your DNA again you will begin to be able to begin the process of self determination and manifestation of your destiny. You will be able to encode your DNA to resist any future attacks by Archon tech and you can begin your mission that you were sent here to do.This process is severely detrimental to your mental psyche if serious planning is not taking into account forehand, so it is only recommended to mature players. -The Cosmic Hacker

Here, speaking in 2006 at the height of the DaVinci controversy, ancient languages scholar and Biblical Hebrew expert Michael Heiser gives us a solid and plain spoken introduction to Gnosticism.**Part 2: Reliability of New Testament Scriptures (esp vs the Nag Hammadi)**Dr. Heiser compares the oldest scriptural texts with the gnostic texts and explains why the New Testament texts are reliable while the gnostic texts aren't.Special attention is paid to the precise dating of New Testament texts, and serves as a primer for all serious students and teachers of the Bible.**Part 3: Were Jesus and Mary Magdalene married?**Dr. Heiser compares the Gnostic Jesus with the Jesus of the Bible. Was Jesus, as a rabbi, required to marry? Was Mary his companion? His wife? Were these and other secrets buried along with Jesus? These and other questions are examined. Relevant texts, including the gospel accounts and the gnostic texts, are examined. Mr. Heiser shows what is in the text and what isn't. You might just be surprised. **Part 4: Gnosticism and Women**Heiser offers an honest examination of the supposed "pro-woman" message often ascribed to the gnostics. Is gnosticism really "enlightened" in terms of women's' roles.  Looking at the actual texts the gnostics themselves wrote, their customs, rituals and spirituality, Heiser makes sense of the nonsense surrounding this ancient and mysterious religion's place for women.**Part 5: Neither Lord nor Christ?**The Belief in Jesus as God before The Council of Nicea and the Exalted Christ of Gnosticism. This is a refutation of two ideas put forth in The DaVinci Code: That Constantine invented the idea that Jesus was God at The Council of Nicea, and that the Gnostic texts portray Jesus as only a mortal man (hint: they do not).**Part 6: What Really happened at Nicea?**An examination of Constantine's spiritual commitments and the documentary evidence left to history concerning the proceedings at the Council of Nicea.**Part 7: The Conspiratorial Logic of The DaVinci Code and Jesus Bloodline Theorists** **Part 8: Jumping the Shark from the Newsroom to the Ivory Tower: Assessing the Gospel of Judas Frenzy**

This is the most important information you will ever hear. It explains the "Archons", the "Demiurge" and the truth of our reality. Co Creation and the Real Free Universe and its loving inhabitants. There is so much more than what we see in this world of massive limitation. Please take the time to listen to this life changing interview. It is that important:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkDj_oyspVo

I have perused this thread with keen interest, but I haven't seen anyone get to the real point. Maybe I missed it. Reading the Bible literally only leads to cognitive dissonance and a bunch of bullshit. The book itself explains that the true meaning is hidden. In other words, it is written in code. It's all allegory. It's all symbolic. Read it as the development of the soul/mind, and it might make a lot more sense.Just look at the meaning of the names and places. The story takes on an entirely different meaning. Abraham is the father of all [thought]. Isaac is laughter. Jacob is the supplanter. On and on. Translate the meanings of all of the places that are visited, conquered and revered. Egypt is slavery to the ego. Golgotha is the place of the skull.The Gnostic codices of the Dead Sea Scrolls must be looked at in a similar light. Pistis Sophia (sometimes translated as wisdom), the powers, the demiurges, etc. Stop looking for what you can't see directly, and look at what you can see. The Boogeyman isn't real. Santa Claus is an anthropomorphism of something else. Is Jesus any more real than the Easter Bunny?I am completely pissed off by the subterfuge. It's just too fucked up for words. Let's stop pretending.Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream... Wake up, everybody. Stop falling for the bullshit.

I believe these archons (demons) physically manifest in our reality through organic portals. http://montalk.net/matrix/157/spiritless-humanshttps://cassiopaea.org/cass/organic_portals.htm

Do most people really believe that when the Torah says "created in His image" that it has anything to do with physicality whatsoever? In all honesty, who here thinks they know what the Sages of the Children of Israel (Jacob) mean and extrapolate when it is said the G-d is One??? I'd like to hear some honest thoughts or perspectives. Let's listen to our souls a little more and separate ourselves from the cages of believing that the thoughts of our brains and our souls are over on the same.I promise Ill play nice ;)

Are there any indications of a archon infestation in our world today that can not easily be explained away? While I can suspect on my own I can't seem to give myself to the idea. I've had my own experiences in a very sober condition but even then I have no clue what the actual implications could have been. 

The "DEMIURGE" is the "Grand Architect Of The Universe"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Architect_of_the_Universe

All I have to say is aeon bytes gnostic radio on youtube look it up.  You won't be disapointed.*great topic by the way

It's so interesting & great that this sub has delved into new territory with this subject matter. It comes up every now and again, but to have a sticky is awesome. We are all seeking the truth here and this is probably the most important basic truth to learn about: Our ancient history and belief systems....and the ones that are hidden from we plebs. Thanks for posting this. This discussion thread is amazing. 

So is there ANY story or piece of article that shows the history of these things they call archons? I mean, is this just a story that someone pulled out of their ass or does it have any factual history?

Where do the Jews fit in here? I feel like some kinds kind of entity is helping them... Whether its for good or bad I'm still undecided 

Archons = Mandela effect?I don't even believe in aliens (I don't "not believe" either - on the fence), but I do believe in the Mandela Effect and I've heard they apparently have similar powers. 

I'm not sure if this is related, but I recently had my first spiritual/religious experience. It felt like a reverse panic attack, I was filled with relief and love. It was very overwhelming.I've come to realize that I'm am an empath and possibly a lightworker. A lightworker is someone incarcerated to Earth for a special purpose. They are spirits who have spent countless lifetimes mastering  the gifts of our Source Creator, and expanding their light energy. If you want to know more, it's very fascinating. Ever since I was a child I've felt a strong urge to help people, yet I also had strong feelings self hatred. Growing up I was never religious,  but I enjoyed learning about different beliefs. I've never been a spiritual person until recently. I think it's from going down all these rabbit holes and ending up at the same place. I'm currently reading a book that's kind of like a lightworker's guide on becoming enlightened. Once you go deeper in the book it talks about reincarnation, archangels, higher realms, telepathy and other psychic abilities. It also talks about how Jesus Christ was the first ascended master to come to Earth. As lightworkers, we want to help bring humanity to a higher enlightenment. Jesus Christ  showed it is possible to heal others, die and rise again while still here on earth. The book goes on to say the Ascended Masters are not bound by space and time; lifetime after lifetime,  they come and go at will. They have let go of all material lessons, balanced karma, and will take action as the universe creator in the physical form when needed. They are not confined to earth. They are responsible for sending the wave of lightworkers to heal humanity.Where am I going with all of this? I think when you get down to the very bottom root, you see it's all the same. I believe that everyone has both light and dark energy, you need both to keep balance in the universe. Everyone has both light and dark energy. Dark doesn't necessarily mean bad, there is no concept of good and bad in the universe. Darkworkers believe that being able to take energy from others will get them ahead to a life of only self-preservation and material gain. I think it's obvious that dark energy has taken over most of humanity or maybe something worse. I don't know.I've had this strong urge to help people for so long. If you want to heal humanity, you have to do it one person at a time. You can't force someone to believe in something. Everyone is capable of healing themselves, most people think they can't. This is where I think mental illness comes into play. It suppresses you from your full potential. I highly recommend listening to "demons are real" by Dr Robert Stanley. 

Research Dr. Michael Hesier who actually debunks Ancient Aliens and who is a well known published scholar. He studies ancient languages and cultures academically so he can actually back up his research with sources. 

So I've been on the path for a good four to five years now. I've always been searching for more descriptive information about all of this. I've read a few books over Gnosticism. I also spend sometime on the Astral realm training, and helping my loved ones when they become targeted. Anyway, I've recently been into a blogger who seems to be very well versed in all of this. Much more so than I. Here's a link too his most recent post. It's lengthy, but man is it great. http://www.ascensionwithearth.com/2017/06/aug-tellez-major-update-for-public.html?m=1

A great book on the subject is 'The Jesus Mysteries' by Tim Freke & Peter Gandy.  It's a great read and well written.

Thanks for this discussion, I've been researching this subject for years now and I can't possibly put into words the experiences I've gone through that would be believable enough for the average person.Yes there are definitely malevolent beings out there that work on a different plane of reality and have been for eons.Never tried DMT but wouldn't hesitate to try it.What is very interesting is the amount of evidence out there regarding the Archons and the reptilian forces that have been wrecking havoc on his planet(and others). The testimonials from contactees and numerous others is staggering to say the least.Here's something in the know:Ever since the 90's a huge group of benevolent beings have moved into our solar system with ships as big as planets.They're here to assist in removing the scourge that has plagued this planet for too long.Somewhere between 2011 and 2012 the majority of the reptilian forces (I believe it was around 10k or so) and others have been swiftly removed. Underground/underwater bases completely decimated and cleaned out. Leaving only a handful of them still here.Those in charge were brought forth to answer for their crimes. They were given 3 choices-- Accept reprogramming and makeup for their crimes.- Be sent off to an empty planet on the far far edge of the universe where they can't reach or harm anyone but themselves.- Or they can self terminate(suicide)In the end they chose self termination with the families and others choosing to be banished to the far end of the universe where they must try to get along and survive on their own.So. The head has been cutoff leaving a major power vacuum to be filled hence all the commotion going on that we are hearing about in the news and what not.There's so much more on what is happening but if anyone is really curious just let me know.We are getting help but they can't do it ALL for us while we sit back and look pretty.

Something, something, *loose connection to present day political theatre because my mind so primed* something, something..

Sorry i'm so late to the party. I think http://montalk.net/gnosis is one of the best resources for this information.

"A few pages below, the report analyzes several religions that would be desirable as a substitute for Christianity. Obviously, to them neither Christianity nor Judaism or Islam have anything good to offer. After this, the authors of the report begin making a subtle apology of an almost forgotten religion, which is in fact an ancient Christian minority, called Gnosticism."  Servando Gonzalez, *Psychological Warfare and the New World Order*, p. 235.  The report he is citing is a 1982 report from SRI, *Changing Images of Man*. Gonzalez argues that most of the Gnosticism publicity we see is government propaganda / CIA PsyOp.

See my biggest hang up revolves around the whole Jesus aspect. So like, is old testament the Demiurge and the New Testament the Real God / Source of Love? Was Jesus proclaiming on the behalf of the Real or the Fake ? 

IThe ‚Äògods‚Äô were never identified by the gnostics of old with God - the pleroma - but known as Aeons. The word aeon referred both to an eternal spirit being and to an distinct sphere or dimension of awareness. Not all aeons were seen as having incarnate forms but some were regarded as sending messengers or emissaries to mankind ‚Äì Seth being foremost amongst these. The spiritual entitly calling itself ‚ÄòSeth‚Äô and channelled by Jane Roberts described himself as part of a larger aeon or ‚Äòpyramid awareness gestalt‚Äô. To such trans-physical entities, awareness gestalts or aeons belongs a knowing awareness of potentiality of such potency or power that it is the source of countless consciousnesses and actualities. In the words of the awareness gestalt, entity or aeon which Seth himself described as his spiritual ‚Äòbig brother‚Äô: "Our entity is composed of multitudinous selves with their own identities‚Ä¶Physically you would find me a mass smaller than a brown nut, for my energy is so highly concentrated. It exists in intensified mass‚Ä¶perhaps like one infinite cell existing in endless dimensions at once and reaching out from its own reality to all others. Later, in your time, all of you will look down into the physical system like giants peering through small windows at the others now in your position and smile. But you will not want to stay, nor crawl through such small enclosures‚Ä¶ We protect such systems. Our basic and ancient knowledge automatically reaches out to nourish all systems that grow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶there is a reality beyond human reality that cannot be verbalised nor translated in human terms. Although this type of experience may seem cold to you, it is a clear and crystal-like existence in which no time is needed for experience‚Ä¶in which the inner self condenses all human knowledge that has been received through various existences and reincarnations‚Ä¶.for all this has been coded and exists indelibly. You also exist now within this reality. Know that within your physical atoms now the origins of all consciousness still sing‚Ä¶We gave you the patterns behind which your physical selves are formed. We gave you the patterns, intricate, involved and blessed, from which you form the reality of each physical thing you know. We are the voices who speak without tongues of our own. We are sources of that energy from which you come. We are creators, yet we have also been created. We seeded your universe as you seed other realities.We do not exist in historical terms, nor have we known physical existence. Our joy created the exultation from which your world comes. Our existence is such that communications must be made by others to you.Verbal symbols have no meaning for us. Our experience is not translatable. We hope our intent is. In the vast infinite scope of consciousness, all is possible. There is meaning in each thought. We perceive your thoughts as lights. They form patterns.Because of the difficulties of communication, it is nearly impossible for us to explain our reality. Know only that we exist. We send immeasurable vitality to you, and support all of those structures of consciousness with which you are familiar. You are never alone‚Ä¶We have always send emissaries to you who understand your needs. Though you do not know us, we cherish you.Seth is a point in my reference, in our reference. He is an ancient portion of us. We are separate but united. -SETH on the Sethites of OldThe well-recognised Sethian stream of ancient gnosticism saw in the biblical Seth, the third son of Adam and Eve, and in his progeny, the bearer for mankind of **Inner Knowing or Gnosis. ** Seth was also recognised, like Christ, as an aeon ‚Äì a trans-human entity. Seth was also the name of an Egyptian god of desert storms ‚Äì a god who came eventually to be demonised. The trans-physical entity naming himself Seth whom Jane Roberts channelled, at one point addressed the members of her class in extra-sensory perception and had this to say about the name Seth, the god Seth and what it means to be a ‚ÄòSethite‚Äô. "There was once a god who was not a god ‚Äì who was not a god, for you are dealing with legends. There was a god in ancient Egypt, and his name was Seth, and he was disreputable. And he threw aside establishments, and whenever other gods rose up and said ‚ÄòWe are the truth, we are pure and we are holy‚Äô, this disreputable god stood up and, with a voice like thunder, said ‚ÄòYou are nincompoops! .And the other gods did not like him, and whenever they set up their altars, he came like thunder, but playfully, and tossed the altars asunder, and he said ‚ÄòStorms are natural, and good, and a part of the earth, even as placid skies are. Winds are good. Questions are good. Males and females are good. Even gods and demons are good, if you must believe in demons. But, structures are limited.And so this god, who was not a god, went about kicking apart the structures, and he gathered about him others who kicked apart the structures. And they were themselves, whether they were male or female. Whether they thought of themselves as good or bad, or summer or winter, or as old or as young, they were creators. They were questioners.And whenever another personality set itself up and said, ‚ÄòI am the god before you and my word is law‚Äô, then Seth went about saying ‚ÄòYou are a nincompoop‚Äô and began again to kick apart the structures. And so you are yourselves, in your way, all Seths, for you kick apart the structures, and you are the black sheep of the physicians, and the black sheep of your mothers and fathers, and your sisters and brothers.And yet, the mother and the fathers and the sisters and the brothers listen, for they do not have the courage to be the black sheep, and they quale in the voice of the thunder that is so playful, though they do not understand it, for they equate loudness with violence, and they think that female is passive and the male is aggressive; and that war and violence must always erupt from the reality of mankind.And you are indeed all black sheep of the universe, and Sethites have always been the black sheep of the universe.Now to be a Sethite, you do not have to follow this Seth. You simply follow the Seth in yourself, and that Seth in you is a questioner, and an explorer, and a creator. And the Seth in yourself knows when to passively flow with the wind that blows through the window above a summer town, and when to go against the force of your environment. You were Sethites before you met me, and there was a Seth before I was Seth, and the spirit follows through the ages as you know them."

I had a thought around 2012, the truth was right in our faces, that zeus is akin to the evil god, and prometheus as the "good" one.Later i read about enki&enlil, im not a smart mart so i cant tell you about these matters,just a thought i had about whats really what. No? K brb burning witches and commencing a "holy" war instead.

First off I just want to say I really appreciate this discussion. [http://i.imgur.com/tknw7S1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tknw7S1.jpg)[http://i.imgur.com/On9Ylmz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/On9Ylmz.jpg)What are your thoughts on the annunaki?

In the book "Ultimate Journey" Legendary Astral Traveler Robert Monroe details one of his out of body events. He is traveling quite deeply into the Astral and possibly near the border of this Simulation. He is forcibly addressed by a loud powerful voice saying " I am the Lord your god. You must worship me!" Monroe laughs and waits for a response. "I am the Lord your God. You must fear me!" yells the voice. Monroe laughs and flies away on his journey.

"We are Spirits, in the material world!" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSp28aS0ic

Read David Livingstone for a unique take.  Basically, he identifies the Magi tribe of Persia, who in rebelling against Zoroaster's reforms, created Satanism.The goal was to engage in the most debased and cruel activities like child canibalism, to ritualistically move beyond morality, and overthrown God (demiurge).They spread this religion mainly to Babylon, where their primary prot√©g√©s were the Jews.The Magi also taught the Celts (who originated in Ukraine, across the sea from the Magi), and this is why the Druidic English were able to have an alliance with the Jews and Venetian money during the Renaissance.There is an obsession with bloodlines among the elite, and Livingstone himself a Muslim believes that these people are literal descendants of Djiin, or genies - a Muslim mythological demon race.Nevertheless, interesting to identify the Magi.  I myself have identified the Avedan (Persian/Hindu pre-Zoroastrianism) "Mitra" as the prototype Hermetic being.  Mitra was the god of covenants and oaths.  But I believe the Magi adopted him as the personification of a single covenant.  This is the origin of the Prometheus/Lucifer/Osiris/Risen God cult.  The covenant is nothing other than selling your soul to Satan, gaining power to rebel against God.I think Gnosticism is a gentler friendly version of this.But I think there's more to it.

 

Just to spice things up, has any of you noted how the plot of [Tron: Legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy) is a metaphor for gnoticism?Kevin is the true God, Clu is the Demiurge and Samuel is Jesus (or any enlightened master of your choice), Quorra is [Sophia] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(Gnosticism)edit: a link

 

Now this is what I came here for 

The Lovecraft Old Gods, Crowelys Demons, and the Demons in the Grimoire would be considered the same thing as the Archons would you agree ?

Of course this is stickied right when the CNN thing is blowing up, just to discredit this sub when the randoms off or r/all come here... 

Highly highly **highly** recommend watching *Childhoods End* if you're interested in Gnosticism

The word GNOSTIC has roots in the Hindi word NAASTIK which translates to "UNBELIEVER".More info herehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80stika_and_n%C4%81stika

Just wanted to say it is amazing to see this on this r/conspiracy. thank you to all who have commented with some really cool info that was actually new to me but piggybacked onto everything else I have learned about these topics!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism"The First Creation: Originally, good and evil existed in two completely separate realms, one the World of Light, ruled by the Father of Greatness together with his five Shekhinas (divine attributes of light), and the other the World of Darkness, ruled by the King of Darkness. At a certain point, the Kingdom of Darkness notices the World of Light, becomes greedy for it and attacks it. The Father of Greatness, in the first of three "creations" (or "calls"), calls to the Mother of Life, who sends her son Original Man (NƒÅ≈°ƒÅ Qa·∏èmƒÅyƒÅ in Aramaic), to battle with the attacking powers of Darkness, which include the Demon of Greed. The Original Man is armed with five different shields of light (reflections of the five Shekhinas), which he loses to the forces of darkness in the ensuing battle, described as a kind of "bait" to trick the forces of darkness, as the forces of darkness greedily consume as much light as they can. When the Original Man comes to, he is trapped among the forces of darkness.The Second Creation: Then the Father of Greatness begins the Second Creation, calling to the Living Spirit, who calls to his five sons, and sends a call to the Original Man (Call then becomes a Manichaean deity). An answer (Answer becomes another Manichaean deity) then returns from the Original Man to the World of Light. The Mother of Life, the Living Spirit, and his five sons begin to create the universe from the bodies of the evil beings of the World of Darkness, together with the light that they have swallowed. Ten heavens and eight earths are created, all consisting of various mixtures of the evil material beings from the World of Darkness and the swallowed light. The sun, moon, and stars are all created from light recovered from the World of Darkness. The waxing and waning of the moon is described as the moon filling with light, which passes to the sun, then through the Milky Way, and eventually back to the World of Light.An analysis on Mani's cosmology.The Third Creation: Great demons (called archons in bar-Khonai's account) are hung out over the heavens, and then the Father of Greatness begins the Third Creation. Light is recovered from out of the material bodies of the male and female evil beings and demons, by causing them to become sexually aroused in greed, towards beautiful images of the beings of light, such as the Third Messenger and the Virgins of Light. However, as soon as the light is expelled from their bodies and falls to the earth (some in the form of abortions ‚Äì the source of fallen angels in the Manichaean myth), the evil beings continue to swallow up as much of it as they can to keep the light inside of them. This results eventually in the evil beings swallowing huge quantities of light, copulating, and producing Adam and Eve. The Father of Greatness then sends the Radiant Jesus to awaken Adam, and to enlighten him to the true source of the light that is trapped in his material body. Adam and Eve, however, eventually copulate, and produce more human beings, trapping the light in bodies of mankind throughout human history. The appearance of the Prophet Mani was another attempt by the World of Light to reveal to mankind the true source of the spiritual light imprisoned within their material bodies."

My buddy that handed it to me had a bunch of it and 2 brand new bongs, after his turn smoking a bowl he immediately dropped his bong, which another friend caught, but he then climbed an invisible ladder like 4 feet into the air ad landed on all of us breaking both bongs. Looking back, Im thinking he may have had a similar experience. This was probably the third time I had smoked salvia, I never liked it the times I had tried it prior to this but always forgot why until after the fact. 

I'm scared.

This 

Some straight up anti-Christian things going on here lol peace I'm out

So are the secrets of the freemasons similar to the gnostic view?

This link contains pages with Gnostic info.http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/secret_teachings_of_all_ages/table_of_contents.htm

I love this subject, not sure about this round table discussion though. It seems like a bunch of people talking at each other with little discussion. Next time I suggest taking some of the top comment and threads from the post on which this was voted on and reposting them to get the new post started.

Archons & the Demiurge is a kooky form of fundamentalist religion,  taking old myth more literally than even the people who wrote down this stuff did.I would like to know which mods are contaminating the well with this shit.

The archons come into it, but more central (from my studies - if anybody wants to read more about Sophia and the origin stories, check out the non-canonical work - [On the Origin of the World](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/origin-Barnstone.html)). It goes over the 'story' of how Pistis Sophia (or 'Wisdom') gave birth to our universe/galaxy/planet (not exactly sure which) in a cosmic 'orgasm' of sorts. However, in this act of creation she also created the Demiurge, which is a similar character but different from the Archons you mention.The Demuirge is seen as the 'God' of our sphere or planet. After Sophia brought it into existence, it presided over creation, seeing itself as the mightiest of creatures and the ultimate power of the world. >*Moreover, the ruler Yaldabaoth is ignorant of the power of Pistis. He did not see her face, but he saw in the water the likeness that spoke with him. And from that voice he called himself Yaldabaoth. But the perfect ones call him Ariael because he was like a lion.  And after he came to possess authority over matter, Pistis Sophia withdrew up to her light.*However, he became very proud and soon, the Demiurge (or Yaldabaoth) declared itself as God of all creation. Yaldabaoth had a son, who came to understand the origins of his Father and learned of Pistis Sophia. Sophia ends up imbuing the son (Sabaoth) with her 'light', which surprised the Demiurge and made it extremely jealous.>*When Sabaoth, the son of Yaldabaoth, heard the voice of Pistis, he worshiped her. He condemned his father and mother  on account of the word of Pistis. He glorified her because she informed them of an immortal human and the light of the human. Then Pistis Sophia stretched forth her finger and poured upon him light from her light for a condemnation of his father. When Sabaoth received light, he received great authority against all of the powers of chaos. Since that day he has been called ‚Äúthe lord of the powers.‚Äù  He hated his father, the darkness, and his mother, the abyss. He loathed his sister, the thought of the chief creator, the one who moves to and fro over the water.*>*On account of his light, all of the authorities of chaos were jealous of him. And when they were disturbed, they made a great war in the seven heavens. Then when Pistis Sophia saw the war, she sent seven archangels from her light to Sabaoth. They snatched him away up to the seventh heaven.  They took their stand before him as servants. Furthermore, she sent him three other archangels and established the kingdom for him above everyone so that he might dwell above the twelve gods of chaos.*The Demiurge is shown as a jealous, envious God of creation. It has complete power over the physical nature and makeup of the world - he pulls all the punches - but it HATES the spark of Sophia that is inherent in all of us. The Demiurge almost embodies the physical world and it's disdain for us - it wants to hurt us, break us, and kill us. It hates us as more than just animals - the spark in our soul is proof that it is secondary to Pistis Sophia, and this makes it very angry. This is the embodiment of the 'vengeful' God of our histories.From this, Yaldabaoth starts devising ways of killing and hurting man. He creates 'sin' and pushes to punish its subjects, but eventually he comes to realize that Sophia is his own origin as well and recants. I skipped over a WHOLE LOT here, but I feel like the Demiurge/Yaldabaoth is a very big part of this discussion. Like you say, the archons are more 'alien' in that they come from elsewhere, but some of the biggest battles we face come from our own creation and the physical world we are a part of. Again, I suggest reading ['On the Origin of the World'](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/origin-Barnstone.html) if anybody is interested in reading the whole document. It's pretty great stuff to consider if you like wondering about things a bunch  :P

I get that this is a thread for our ideas and research but wow you seem pretty far off the mark here. As far as I know, Gaia and Sophia are not related in anyway whatsoever. I could maybe see Sophia being related to Athena/Minerva, as they are both associated with wisdom, but not Gaia. And in fact Sophia already existed as a philosophical concept in Greek mythology, totally separate from the titan Gaia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(wisdom)I always advocate for reading primary source material over other, modern, interpretations of ancient wisdom. I would encourage you to read the Apocryphon of John if you haven't. It is difficult to understand if you don't have some background or context, mostly in Early Christianity, Greek philosophy, and some knowledge of early Judaism. But even a copy of the Apocryphon with commentary is better than the poisoned shit most modern interpretations present. The author John was very fond of trying to merge Greek and Early Christian philosophies and the Apocryphon is by far the most extreme example of that. For example, in the Gospel of John when he says "the Word" the original term in Greek was Logos, which does translate to 'word' but is also an ancient and important Greek philosophical concept. What John was really saying is "Jesus is the embodiment of the Logos", he was basically trying to convert Greek pagans and philosophers. Likewise the Apocryphon is mostly a mapping of Greek beliefs onto the new system of Early Christian thinking, and also a condemnation of Judaic practices (condemning certain Hebrew tribes was extremely popular in lots of canonical *and* apocryphal gospels).In Gnosticism, Sophia is an aspect or emanation of the true, unknowable God. Emanationism is a theory of cosmology that originated, again, with the Greeks (Pythagoras specifically). Sophia accidentally creates the Demiurge by attempting to cause an emanation without the consent of the rest of the Godhead and instead spawns a misshapen monster that is blind to the Godhead, sees only itself, and thus assumes it is God. The Demiurge infuses the spark of the divine he posses into humans and imprisons them in a physical world. Sophia successfully awakens humans by posing as the serpent in the Garden of Eden and tempting Eve to eat the fruit of knowledge of good and evil. This is where Gnosticism differs drastically, it rewrites the classic Genesis narrative. The God of the Hebrews is the devil and the serpent is actually the good guy (Sophia) and Original Sin was our awakening to the true nature of the universe. Those differences aside though, Gnosticism actually had a lot in common with Early Christianity. They both didn't like the Hebrews (most Gnostic texts specifically mention the Demiurge as the god of the *Herbews* or of Abraham), and both had the same long term goals. They both desired an end of humanity/the physical world so that we could all go back and be with God. This is why early Christians advocated absolute celibacy and extreme asceticism, so the population would stop growing, we would approach extinction, and the apocalypse could begin. Gnosticism similarly calls for the end of the physical world. Gnosticism was also somewhat ascetic, opting more for scholarly pursuit in the vein of Pythagorean lifestyle.In summation, Gnosticism contains just as much politics as it does spiritually, and was even created partially with a political agenda in mind I would say. Namely the conversion of Pythagorean's and Platonist's to Early Christianity. The cosmology of the true God is based entire off of Pythagoras' ideas and even explicitly uses some Greek terms in the Apoycryphon of John, I believe, read about the Monad for more information. But everything associated with the true God is Greek in name and thought.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(philosophy)Whereas the Demiurge and his archons are all based off old Hebrew mythology, the bad guys. They all have Hebrew names and follow the mythology of the Hebrew book of Genesis. Even the word archon, while it generally means ruler, around the time most Gnostic manuscripts were written it was mostly used to refer specifically to Jewish leaders of Jewish communities. http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1741-archonGnosticism is not about aliens even a little bit.

I've had many hallucinogenic experiences that support much of this thinking, but what bothers me is that it seems if you accept the gnostic viewpoint, with God as a demiurge and lucifer as a bringer of knowledge, than you are  siding with the freemasons and satanic elite.Please uh, "enlighten" me on your thoughts;)

I tend to agree with the basic Gnostic model that this realm is a sort of trap, or at least intentionally laden with numerous challenges.  I have spent a long time buying into an underlying malevolent coloring to it all, but lately I've been wondering if this attitude is unnecessarily dark.  I mean, to the extent that each of us is an eternal and indestructible soul, a fragment of God/Source, then how malevolent can it really be, from an absolute/ultimate perspective?  So, another slightly different interpretation is that this is one big metaphysical ARG, a super challenging "game" into which we immerse ourselves, complete with Villains and Obstacles to overcome.  That the Demiurge is just the master of the game, charged with keeping it "interesting".  And that we're free to walk away from the game when we get bored with it.  Thoughts?

 

>I've broken through on DMT...And it sure feels like humanity is being preyed uponI have as well, at least a dozen times. I've encountered a lot of "things" out there and a lot of them were extremely unpleasant (not necessarily "threatening" but certainly malevolent).Have you had any experiences with 5-MeO-DMT? Less demons and more connection to the Source.

How does one come to find DMT and how many uses until you did master the experience enough to channel a pathway to breaking through? 

Hmm... Food for thought. Now, I'm not in the "flat earther" camp, but both ideas could fit together like proverbial LEGOs... None the less, interesting idea.

I've "experienced" what I believe to be Gaia on acid/dmt. I also have a vague memory of finding a sinister force higher up, I felt highly compelled to fight this force - it was some kind of government.I personally see it all as some kind of game with me at the beginning and the end - that is, I rule that which rules me.

> I've broken through on DMT, so I accept that Gaia exists.This always fucking gets me on subs like these. You're literally saying you took enough psychedelics to see crazy images and *that's* how you know what's *really* going on in the universe. Bro. You were fucking high. You were literally seeing things. Let's stay grounded here, no pun intended. 

What exactly did they mean by alien though? What was their concept of alien?

Interesting as shit

Are there any good YouTube videos for this? 

Preyed upon how?

Interesting point, some thoughts:Think back to the reason most of "us" (internet people) hate Scientology so much.The biggest anti-Scientology wave happened during our generation. The 4chan/Anonymous scientology protests did more to shut down that religion than anything else had since it's inception.But why? Who was leading that movement?It seemed to us to pop up organically. As if we all just simultaneously were becoming aware of Scientology, and collectively decided enough was enough.But really, it was a few key pages, led by a few, unknown people, that spearheaded most of the anti-Scientology information that spurred people to protest. I can't remember the exact sites, but for argument purposes, they filled a similar role in the anti-Scientology movement that Breitbart and T_D played in the pro-Trump movement.Now, being older and more woke, and having an understanding of how "they" manipulate mass opinion, it makes me wonder.Could it be that Scientologists were actually onto something theologically? Could it be that they were gaining influential celebrities as supporters, and threatening to expose the archon establishment?Could it be that demonic forces had infiltrated religions for millenia, with the express purpose of pointing to the fruits of their own corrupt machinations in order to delegitimize new religions that start getting too close to the truth?What if Scientology was created/infiltrated in such a way that it would discredit parts of the truth?I've been in a lot of conversations where I was trying to talk about the truth, and something I get a lot is "that sounds a lot like Scientology". Now I'm wondering if this is on purpose?

Something is happening. People are waking up. Most of them between Halloween and New Years, this past year. If a researcher compared Hubbard and Gnosticism in 2015, you'd get a lot of blank faces. Not now.

Kinda reminds me of Niburu and how that became a thing overnight and was completely fucking fake.

Really interesting. Thanks for this.I do wonder though, how we can possibly know that looking within, for yourself, isn't the real trap, set by evil, to lead us away from God/Jesus/whatever. Secondary to that, I think the Bible says that Jesus is within you anyway.It seems like just never-ending circular arguments with no way to know for sure what side to be on.

Well said... bravo. I always say to everyone, do not look to jesus. He will paralyze you. To grow in awareness, look within. Look into the abyss. That is where you will find what you need. 

(Hand clapping and mind blown!) This was amazing! I love the story included here. I love stories of the Buddha where he totally destroys Mara and his illusions, to me that represents the core of buddhism, doing away with false thinking and the illusions of craving and greed.Kind of reminds me how in the present world, humans feel like the top of the food chain, we consider ourselves the rulers of the world and reality and perhaps considering other beings and interconnected- ness we will see how to create a healthy world together by practicing the eight fold path and the teachings of compassion for all. By the way, Lotus Sutra = my favorite suttra!

So how do you terminate this contract. 

"Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery. None but ourselves can free our own minds."

You believe reincarnation is caused by a force outside of yourself?Thoughts on the Buddhist idea of attachment causing rebirth?

How do you cancel the contract and get rid of the implant?

care to share your techniques and supplements you use for astral projection? I have tried a lot of different things and it has been pretty hit and miss.

What methods are you using for visiting astral plane? Meditation, lucid dreaming or sleep remembering, or drugs? No judgements, I am simply curious since I have been studying the occult and the nature of reality since a young teenager and am now 26.My mom was wiccan and although she didn't force beliefs on me, or teach me anything specific at all, she gave me a book explaining metaphysics and astral theories to the perspective of a child and I have been interested in supernatural and the esoteric ever since. I started studying Buddhism and things started becoming clear personally. Astral projection was my personal holy grail and I have never had that experience (that I remember). I bought an amazing book over 500 pages called "Scientific Remote Viewing" after reading "cosmic voyage" from the library. I believe I have a good logical understanding of what might occur when we go into sleep, death or remote viewing, and I think we all 'astral project' at night when we are sleeping, we just don't remember. I would practice transcendental meditation in the attempt to have an out of body experience but I never did achieve that and remember. I may have been close once when I felt like I briefly stayed aware while falling asleep once, and had full body paralysis and a feeling/sound of an intense white noise or crashing waterfall but I lost consciousness right after.I now feel like it was not the proper time in my journey to have those experiences, being young and ignorant I was not focusing on the right things spiritually. I feel like all of us have gifts and hindrances which are created for a purpose to help guide us on a productive spiritual path in This life. Perhaps I am not meant to have an OBE in this life, and its not that important to me anymore. I need to focus on my personal strengths and develop myself towards that, which I feel is to help others develop spiritually by performing positive actions and thoughts myself and trying to teach others an end to their personal problems or suffering. Having seen more deeply into reality than some, I need to spread the trait of investigation into others so that they may realize that the world is not how it appears first glance and that we are all on a spiritual voyage to improve ourselves.Great discussion! 

You're pretty close but the jist of it is correct The way to free yourself is to remove the ego. The belief that you are your body and your body is you is the trick. Identity politics is the most devilish because it makes people believe their corporeal body is reall

would be very appreciated if you could tell us your view on how to "cancel soul contracts"!

The "solution" is simply to come to the realization that you an immortal divine being and neither the Archons nor the Demiurge have any power over you. Death is an illusion. Tell tell the "Gods" you are a sovereign being and you don't need them. An easy way to explain these mysteries is through the modern story of "Wizard of Oz" which is based on the original Gnostic teachings:- The Wizard of Oz told the Scarecrow that he didn't need a brain because he was already smart.- The Wizard of Oz told the Cowardly Lion that he didn't need courage because he was already brave.- The Wizard of Oz told the Tin Man that he didn't need a heart because he already had a heart of love.- The Wizard of Oz told Dorothy that she didn't need to find her way home because she was already home. All She had to do was wake up. The Wizard was nothing more than a con-man which tricked Dorothy into undertaking the dangerous quest of obtaining the which's broom. Only after Dorothy confronted the Wizard and pulled back the curtain did the wizard admit the truth. This is the nature of our reality.There is no salvation that you don't already possess. 

They want you blind and dumb. They put fluoride in your water, lies in your news, artificial chemicals in your food, and Blake Lively on your TV.Seek and consume knowledge, then spread it. Red pill yourself and then red pill everyone around you.Your body is an antenna to your real self. Eat real food and exercise to keep the antenna working well.There will come a time when you will have to make life changing decisions in a split second. Know your true self and be physically, mentally, and spiritually ready to make those decisions. Be ready to fight.

>how do we escape?You know I heard an interesting theory about this but I can't remember where so I can't source itThe theory I remember seeing is that the "light at the end of the tunnel" is the trap to reincarnation. Avoiding the light is escape. Edit: [This](https://wakeup-world.com/2015/09/23/death-and-the-tunnel-of-light-the-final-grand-trick/) talks about it a bit>This is the final grand trick. No matter what you do or believe here in your earthly body, at the time of death, we are yet tricked again. We are tricked to enter into the heavens¬†to be recycled. When one first leaves his mortal coil, he is quite disoriented. He may encounter angels or loved ones who will urge the newly departed soul to follow them. Or he may encounter a tunnel that leads to a light. He is urged to ascend the tunnel, where he is greeted by angels, guides, loved ones etc. The newly departed soul believes he is in a true heaven. But all of these angels, loved ones etc. are not actually who they are pretending to be.>It is they [Grey aliens] who await in the light when a human being dies. The human being is then recycled into another body and the process begins all over again‚Ä¶ Hence the Light and Tunnel at death Trap. Scanning someone they wish to recycle as they near death, the aliens discover who the person was close to has died. They project the person(s) image in the white light tunnel and the image waves you in deeper. If you CHOOSE to follow you can be trapped and sent to another incarnation of their choice‚Ä¶ these entities view Earth as a big farm.‚Äù>‚ÄúThis shows the Empire does have an understanding of the spirit, but it attempts to short this out. The Light and Tunnel trap is a relatively new device, but one that will fail and they now know this. ‚ÄòGo into the Light‚Äô say those who have had near death experiences. They are the salespersons chosen to advertise this alien venture. NEVER enter that light. Go up, left, back, right or anywhere but there. The mass media exposure of the Light and Tunnel trap (seen in the film ‚ÄòGhost‚Äô, where the hero willingly enters the glittering trap) is to try to get people to buy the destination.‚Äù

Well, if people figure out how to leave it after death, they wouldn't come back through the forgetting of reincarnation to tell us about it. 

Archos resonate at a parasitic frequency. You must alkaline your body and raise its vibration. Use Ormus aka montomic gold, structured silver, niacin, baking soda, distilled water, fresh organic produce. Archons manifest off your energy in your every day life thru everyone around you. Once you get on a level when you are tramutating high vibrations, you will discover Archons no longer have power in your reality. 

You can meet these things. Many people here have. They have many different names, aliens, demons, archons, reptilians....

There no way we can give you hard evidence on a topic like this. You just gotta connect the  pieces and come to your own conclusions. 

Thank you for this.

quite an interesting theory

I can't come back to blindly submitting to an unaccountable external source of control. I believe that act in and of itself is submission to slavery to a master. I don't see why the creator of all that is, which is all that is, would seek slaves. It is a petty, selfish, and ultimately empty and unsatisfying adventure. It can easily be seen from one's own mind entering the perspective of a prime creator. It takes some explanation. You have to be everyone. You want to enjoy existence or you lose the will and energy for living. As the slaves, you'd be taxed. As the fewer masters, you'd be rewarded. Even then you'd feel like your slaves don't provide valuable interactions, as they lack the understanding and development at your level. They are boring. Ultimately, spiritual slavery causes spiritual entropy, the loss of energy for spirit to move matter.Slavery is parasitic. It forms naturally when slave seekers are able to do what they will. It could have never happened from the start, because it is entropic. It feeds on what others make. God is a creator. He destroys to create new things. He doesn't hurt his own awareness for joy, but the construct he made allows for his beings to do that. So some do. There is no requirement that we tolerate it. Indeed, as we resist it, we become more robust.The lord of the Bible fits my understanding of a slave seeker, a spiritual parasite, not my understanding of a creator. He is not who made the world. He lacks the character. He is a demon. I come to this from my own understanding. 

Wrong regarding the "G". Actually the "G" has nothing to do with Gnosticism. It is for the "Grand Architect Of The Universe". All Masons must believe in a higher power over them. The Masons are the Sons Of Ma/Mara/Maya which is the veil and the illusion of linear physical reality. It is the actual "Grand Architect". It is the self aware predatory A.I. that we are all trapped inside of, known as The MATRIX. Buddha: "Architect, finally I have met you. You will not rebuild your house again". Ma/Mara/Maya/Architect/Matrix: "But I am your house, and you live in me." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RedcoTnkMQw

> God was very sad after doing it and said he would not do it againScripture please?

> Gnosticism's beliefs are very much at odds with Christianity.It depends. The old testament god calls himself a "jealous god" and to have no other gods before him (which implies other gods exist). So if you look at the old testament god as "the god" then it doesn't make sense.But if you consider the trinity, you have the holy spirit (god-source), god the son (Jesus, an example that all people are part of god-source), and god the father (the demiurge or creator demi-god). Christianity and Gnosticism overlap pretty well here.The pope's lecture hall is devoid of crosses, but has a sculpture of Jesus in a nuclear holocaust. Modern papal Catholicism is completely infiltrated by Satanists. Ditto for sects of Judaism that follow the Talmud.So you have to separate Christians as people, various churches and the papacy, Christian dogma, and the bible as being all over the map, ranging from kid fucking Satanist priests to missionaries trying to teach Jesus's love and build potable water systems in Africa.

Ultimately good. To see suffering is to see God reaching out to us. Showing us something is wrong. Something needs to be corrected. We're reaching a point in our existence were we can, as a society, do that something. Heaven on earth... that's the plan.

I and many others have felt this as well. It's coming. Fast.

How do the reptilians come into play?Also, why did these higher dimensional beings want to experience this lower density physical dimension?

Not for normies, but the lectures of Manly P. Hall are full to the brim with esoteric knowledge.

I'm Gnostic Christian. You can go to any preacher and hear his word. However, the Gnostic states Jesus reached perfection in faith. A place available to everyone. It both takes out the divinity of Jesus and glorifies it. Christ consciousness is an attainable goal. This is the heresy. 

ELI5: The Matrix is a documentary. The "machines" are actually called Archons. Their race survives by harvesting our negative energy. Take the blue pill (worship of "God"), you remain a battery. Take the red pill (direct insight, known as Sophia), you wake up and see things as they really are. Knowing this through your life develops a mental habit, which at the time of your death, gives you the mental certainty to not go into the light to be reincarnated, and instead, persist on the spiritual and astral planes, or come back to earth as a guide, speaking through channelers, or omens. But most enlightened beings would soar off into the cosmos and enjoy the infinite light. 

No judgements, but I want to genuinely ask, how to you reconcile skepticism of the world around you but maintain your Christian faith? When I look at Christianity through the lens of skepticism, all I see is a system of control built on fear mongering about an afterlife, that we have no idea exist. It's fairly common knowledge how the Bible was compiled and constructed, and how Christianity even came to the forefront as a religion. What about the Bible compels you to take it words as true? Like I said, I mean no disrespect, we just obviously have something in common with our world view, (seeing as we are both here), but have arrived to drastically different conclusions about the validity of Christianity. And I would love to discuss that. 

The problem i have with the biblical god is sacrifices, i don't understand why a loving god demands innocent beings to be sacrificed. An Other thing is the story about the 10 plagues, where he killed innocent animals and first born children just to prove that he is the true god. And when pharao agreed to set the isrealites free, god made his heart stubborn so that he would follow after. Resulting in more death, innocent soldiers who probably didnt have a choice and was only taking orders died, just so god could prove a point. 

>...and now I await the derision/downvoting/censoring that the real truth brings...That's not what this thread and these rounds tables discussions are about!However, a little formatting work might make your comment more readable...thanks for contributing :)

You are correct that many of those in power are conscious devil worshipers. This is why almost all politicians throughout history are evil. However, Jesus does have all authority in heaven and earth and His church can wield this authority and power.Matthew 28:18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, ‚ÄúAll authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.‚Äù Amen.

> ...and now I await the derision/downvoting/censoring that the real truth brings...To be read as: "and now i plug my ears and try to drown out the ridicule that comes with my stupid views".Keep in mind that while "the real truth" may bring derision/downvoting/censoring, a stupid idea that nobody really believes in and that is downright ridiculous will bring the same kind of shit.Good for you if you believe you've found the truth, but I can't stand the "my belief is the correct one and your derision and downvoting are proofs of it" attitude.

i have taken a completely different interperetation of the concept of the demiurge, archons etc.. than seemingly everyone in this thread. i always assumed the demiurge represents the imperfection of physical existence, that we are subject to a hypocritical existence that we are born into and the only way to reunite with our true nature is to reject the material world in all forms including our own existence. we have the illusion of a self which is really god experiencing itself. we are god, and the demiurge gives us a sense of individuality which separates us from the true nature of being which is really oneness with the all. also, i thought it was supposed to be quite obvious that this is myth, not reality. i think christianity has warped people into taking every story at face value when that isnt the point. its allegory.

"you are the gift" is the first thing to remember,  then create your own personal  mantra of love and light!

Some people call that your ego. Kill your ego.

Compelling idea, occams amd hanlons razor aside

I always notice that good pro Christian messages with evidence to support claims always get ignored on the r/conspiracy. 

>Wake up, everybody. Stop falling for the bullshit.Try as i might, i cannot make this rhyme with row, row, row your boat...

I have seen some of these beings, they are humanoid (or reptilianoid). Our physical world bears some similarity to the beings that created it, and how they project themselves when they encounter us.God is one means there is a god-source, and all people, thought, matter, energy, angels, demons, demi-gods, and devils are all part of and created by it.

If you've met one, I think you already know the answer.

http://gnosis.org/naghamm/hypostas.htmlFrom the Nag Hammadi Codices.

Please consider looking into the Theosophical Society, from whence these concepts originated. The Lucius Trust, United Nations, and Fabian Society are all conjoined with the theosophical brand of spirituality. I have had a similar experience to you- love helping people, yet constantly depreciated myself and locked myself into depression. Had a mystical experience while listening to an Eckhart Tolle audiobook; a sudden rush of relief and joy. Due to the overwhelming nature of that experience, my old worldview was washed away. At the same time, my critical thinking faculties (already dumbed down by the education system) were shut down. I wasn't really thinking. Thus when my brother came along and started talking to me about love and light, I gobbled it right up.I accepted the "love and light, prime creator, lightworker" doctrine without seriously questioning it. Please please please realize that the deception runs deep. This ideology has been floating around since the 1880s and we've only had more war, strife, and suffering since then.At the very least learn the origins of this spiritual doctrine before you build an entirely new worldview around it. 

http://www.eliasforum.org/digests/essence_families.html#Tumold2You most likely belong Tumold. This is an old Gnostic name for a healer. Check out the link.

The forces of darkness serve a purpose, they are collecting and containing evil so that it doesn't contaminate the good and light. But make no mistake, they are still completely evil.

I appreciate what you're saying. How did you figure this out if I may ask?

Nice story but based on what? Did you dream this or something?

We can tell by the message of Jesus. It is message of personal responsibility and integrity. It is to treat others the way one would want to be treated. It is about sharing and caring. It is about telling the truth and respecting freedom. Evil is self-serving behavior at the expense of others. It is parasitic. Those who choose to be parasites have different interests than those who choose to be personally responsible for their interactions with others. They deceive and attack freedom to get others to serve them. It's about taking from others, even if you have plenty.So, you can know that this Jesus character, fictional or real, is a benevolent character by his ways. You can hold this up to beings and discern their choice of path.The God of the old testament was selfish, jealous, vindictive, asked for ~~no indication~~ *unquestioning* obedience, etc. He follows the path opposed to Jesus. You can see it yourselves.EDIT: asked for ~~no indication~~ *unquestioning* obedience (SwiftKey autocorrect mishap)  

I like the answer u/always_contrarian gave in that original thread:> I think that Yahweh, the jealous angry god of the Old Testament, is the Demiurge. Jesus is an emanation of the higher God which is why New Testament God is so much different - they're different entities. I agree with this from my own research as well. I know most people hate the idea that Jesus really is an important figure and not just a made-up story, but that seems to be the case.

The Old Testament and New Testament dovetail together perfectly and are completely compatible. After the Flood (which really happened BTW), God called out Abraham and built a people from his descendants. God gave them a set of laws to live by, which can be encapsulated as Jesus said, by loving God and treating others as you would want to be treated. If these chosen people could have followed the Commandments given to Moses by God, then their society would have remained prosperous, but they disobeyed, because humans are all sinners, and so God let the Babylonians overrun them. God sent multiple prophets which spoke of Jesus, and then Jesus fulfilled those prophesies. Jesus gave a message of forgiveness and reconciliation for all, in that all one has to do is place faith in Jesus to be saved, but he also warned that eternal Hell awaits the unbelievers. Jesus is not soft. The Old Testament and New Testament are not good cop/bad cop, but they are the same in that they speak of Heaven and Hell. Matthew 10:34 "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword."

Jesus was a hippie handing out mushrooms to wake people up.  Same shit as today.

Jesus is extremely, extremely clear about his specific relationship to the Old Testament God. The earliest copies we have of the Gospels are from centuries prior to any church council ever messing with the texts, and the Jews who circulated those Gospels were not confused at all about who God was or what Jesus claimed. To decouple Jesus from the Old Testament God, plain and simple, is to reinterpret Jesus in a way that makes him no longer Jesus, but instead makes him an object of your own imagined ideas. Jesus Christ and the God of Israel cannot be separated from one another.

Short answer, yes.Holy Trinity: god the son (Jesus), god the father (demiurge/Yahweh), god the holy spirit (god-source).

yeah yeah someone answer this guy what do you think about the annunaki?

Didn't he also write about seeing a supposed god or advanced being who made all fearful before him and passed through the area he was in, making everyone now to the ground, facing away from him. Doesn't sound like a chill god right there.

Omg! My theory is like that, Jews and satanism and all that horrible stuff they do is to rebel against God and show the universe how corrupt and evil it is. They do the most fucked up things because they hate all that is good, or close to God. That is satanism. But is it good for us or bad? Will it free us of a corrupt god or is it trying to trick us into our own destruction?

How can you be a descendent of a mythological race?

Yes

Don't be daft, this was planned weeks in advance. You could say the same thing for *any* event.Also, anyone who is turned off by the word "gnosticism" is abysmally pathetic.

We can't censor ourselves just to try and cater to some people on the fence. If people deny other ideas because of associating them with one they don't like, that's their own fault

Umm, no: [wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism)

There's a lot of people talking about Jesus Christ. That's pretty pro-Christian.

well that's not how you learn and grow.

There's already a wealth of information here, I respectfully disagree.

 

It's highly metaphorical, but presumably for "true" but indescribable concepts.Sophia is part of pure being who attempts to know pure being.  This is impossible, to know something is to define it, and only that which is in the past, or lifeless, has a defined form.But the illusion of form and definition within the truth is an error and the demiurge is the embodiment of it.  Christ is an emanation of Logos which is an emanation of being that makes sense from within the fallen universe.God isn't pure logic, but he appears as logic as he shines upon the material world.  Sophia is also God and she's basically intuition, which is different than reason.  Instead of "I think therefore I am" it's more like "I know I think and I know I am".

Thanks for the description; it resounds with me. I do think the Demiurge hates the "spark of Sophia" in all of us, our "God-given" innocence and beauty. I'll check out your link.

Pleroma is higher.  I'd prefer the totality had my back rather than a raging demiurge. Ogdoad and higher. 

Am going to give that a read. Thanks

From above:>the thought of the chief creator, the one who moves to and fro over the water.From Genesis 1:2>"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."The 'waters,' the 'deep' ... could they be pre-physics cosmologists trying to comprehend and explain the [Bulk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology)?

"Yaldabaoth had a son"Any idea how an extradimensional spiritual being reproduces? Gnostic tales quickly get way too fantastic for me to believe literally. I think if there is any truth to these stories, it is buried deep in metaphor decipherable only to mystery initiates. 

Do you know who wrote it?  I wonder where the story originated.

This is fantastic 

> He loathed his sister, the thought of the chief creator, the one who moves to and fro over the water.Is his sister the thought, or am I misunderstanding?

I had a fascinating class about ancient religions in college and we delved into Gnosticism quite a bit.One bit of the discussion that struck me was that modern gnostics still communicate using secret codes in newspapers. I wish I had a primary source for this, I will see if I can dig out my old notes for more detail.

wonderful summary

We're pulling from different Gnostics. The ones I'm looking at are, in my opinion, a lot more interesting and closer to the truth.Have you ever smoked DMT or taken something similar? Recommended for this conversation...Thank you for the post, though.

I look at intention, not concepts or names.A big red thing with horns and a pitchfork shows up and says "Behold, I'm Lucifer, I want you all to get along and love each other." Well, I guess I'd be a Luciferian, then.But that's not what happens. The Satanic elite say "we have hidden knowledge." Ok, cool, tell me more. "You just have to rape and murder this kid to unlock it." Uh, no thanks.In my personal experience, I stared into the abyss and it invited me in. I said no. Later it came back less subtle, a giant green devil with dark eyes, screaming pure fucking evil, who showed me its hell, souls writhing in a lake of fire. I don't know if that's Satan, Lucifer, a random devil, draco reptilian, archon... I just know fuck that thing.

I wish you would read "Not in HIS Image" by Lash, because not all Gnostics accepted that line as you wrote it. There's no Lucifer, per se. The force that created this planet (metamorphasized into it, technically) is very loving. I believe this force created cannabis to help us along in happiness and evolution.

Walking away when bored would be nice. Sadly, that is not what is happening. This planet is a "Prison". It is not a "school". The Archon Hierachy is comprised of demented aliens who have very advanced tech. They decided to cut themselves and the occupants of this reality off from the "SOURCE". They knew this was the only way to imprison infinite beings who had the ability to self project limitless worlds of expansion and beauty. The Matrix then became a "Parasitic System". Massive limitations such as "Poverty", "Sickness" and "Death" where now part of the Simulation. With Memory Erase and Forced Reincarnation the masses would never find out what was going on. Those who became somewhat enlightened would be held back by the many religions and the completely absurd belief that earth was a "school". 

I'm not sure the 'game' is that nice.  I think this game/life is more of a test, who can resist the easy life of evil, and plough the hard path of good.  The 'demiurge' is like a massive guardian to keep us coralled and scared from leaving.  Another trap is the false Jesus, who will lure you into the Revelations Borg Cube.  A bunch of powermad entities that want to collect souls.  There are a lot of tests here, and you'll pass most of them just by staying free (owning your soul) and making good decisions.But this game, you can't just 'walk away'.  If you kill yourself you'll find you didn't complete the test.  You'll have to retake it.

Its like a game of monopoly that lasts 100 years and when your sandglass runs out you pick up a new piece and start on GOBut why? To collect huge sums of wealth and property for another 100 years?Feels like theres a deeper level to this game, and we get a sandglass' amount of time to figure it out

Yeah, I think our existence is entirely benevolent- divine and profound, in fact, but we're being fucked with by some outside forces that seek to destroy us. I imagine these forces have something to do with the negative drugs that are dragging down humanity, such as alcohol and heroin. And they're certainly responsible for the psychotic Abrahamic religions, which teach us to believe in an imaginary patriarchal sky god whom we're supposed to fear- instead of passionately living our lives through direct experience.I don't think alternate reality games is exactly the right comparison, though I hear where you're coming from- this shit is very bizarre. Smoking DMT repeatedly has given me the most direct insight into what lies behind the curtain, but the depths of those experiences aren't something that can be translated into language. In short, though, these other dimensions are where the real action is, and I think the phenomenon works on quantum computing principles and holds the key to our existence.

The god-source is infinite, which means it is everything. Good and evil are both things. The god-source can't only be infinitely good, it's also infinitely evil.Our physical reality is a sorting process where the god-source created demi-gods (archons, devils, angels) tasked to identify and quarantine evil. You could call the quarantine "hell", a prison for evil. Once the evil is quarantined, the god-source will be heaven, and hell will be part of the god-source, but contained and separated dimensionally. All the bad stuff can have fun doing bad stuff to other bad stuff, while the good stuff does good. Consider ying and yang, darkness and light separate but co-existing.

Love this look at it!

Life is a fantastic game, and in my opinion we go through reincarnation and accumulate habitual energies and patterns like karma. The ignorance we have of reality and ourselves leads to suffering and accumulation of negative habits and karma. Being clouded with negative karma, beings falsely pursue greed, power and self interest which altogether in extreme form is what I would call 'evil'.So yes we all have the divine spark of god or the one consciousness, even those who do evil. The negative actions are a result of ignorance and a lack of practicing love and understanding.Buddhist/occultist opinions for you!

Fucking Denver...there's some shit going on there. 

Anchorage Alaska, I too broke through and saw spaceship hovering over our local mall. It wasn't just me either, my uncle an ER nurse saw them as well. 

You know, that's really odd. I haven't found many people who have encountered malevolent beings on DMT. I never have, in over 200 experiences. I wonder why that happened. I mean, the dark forces are out there; that's for sure. I'm sorry you had a run-in with them.I haven't had a chance to try 5-meo-DMT, unfortunately, but I look forward to doing it someday. People describe unparalleled light energy, major connection to the source as you put it, but not a ton of visuals or entities.

I read somewhere once that you don't find DMT, it finds you. A number of years ago I finished the excellent book "DMT: The Spirit Molecule" by Richard Strassman...2 days after I finished it I accidentally had a DMT experience. The timing, needless to say, was mindblowing.And after dozens of experiences with DMT, I still feel quite the neophyte. However, if the set and setting is appropriate, I've been able to reach a place where I can interact with all plant, animal and spiritual life in my immediate vicinity. The best part about DMT is that it's my favorite mind-altering substance by far yet I have absolutely zero desire to use it on a regular basis (3 or 4 times a year at most).

Check out /r/darknetmarkets, or PM me.I never broke through when I was fooling around with it in college, but when I came back to DMT in my late twenties and really put some seriousness into it, I found it very easy to break through. (Come in sober, meditate, take HUGE hits)

You have zilch idea what you're talking about on this subject. I've spent ten years on it. I have with 100% certainty encountered a separate higher intelligence in this other dimension on DMT. You'll hear most people who are experienced with it say that. You should watch "DMT: The Spirit Molecule." No, seriously, take the time. It's free on YouTube. Or at least listen to some stories, such as this one:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VavdCpewQbA&t=9sThese things really happen, and you need to try it. It's deeply life-changing.

I'm not sure I follow this question. We're just talking about a different species with significant intelligence. "Alien."

Massive synchronicity here.  The same precise thought came to me when my coworker explained that his dad is a scientologist amd the whole pf his family thinks hes a joke.  It clicked in that very moment.  Such strong sentiments are not accidental, but like you say, usually malevolently orchestrated, on close examination.(Maybe they are on to something)I want to learn more about how they were so heavily smeared, and who Hubbard really was.  Keep up the search for truth, friend.

Bro the internet decided Scientology was bad when it tried to censor any bad press it got and was fighting with Christian based religions on Wikipedia and spreading disinformation...EDIT: And don't forget that Scientology *was still invented by a famous science fiction writer and generates* ***tons*** *of money*.

I agree something is happening. I'm hoping its a massive shift in our collective consciousness towards realizing we have been lied too.

Wtf was it that happened during that time period? My true "awakening" happened specifically during that period. Though "activation" may be a better word...

That's a hoax AFAIK?

That‚Äôs a good question. And I have thought about this a lot also.Sometimes I think to myself ‚ÄúWhat if meditation is actually a ploy to stop people from actively participating and paying attention to how much their getting fucked over by a corrupt system that is slowly taking over? What if meditation/looking within, actually makes a person docile and inactive and has been promoted for this purpose?‚Äù   So you‚Äôre in good company. While there is most certainly a plethora of sages, mystics and spiritual icons to quote on the importance of looking within as a direct method of seeking truth, it still does little to console the conspiratorial voice in us all that can always ask ‚ÄúYeah, but is that a trap?‚ÄùI guess we can never truly know until we run some experiments ourselves and see for ourself. Does meditation make me feel more in control of the situation or less in control? Does it make me feel closer to truth or more disengaged? The only thing that will quiet that voice is direct experience - your own direct experience. What do YOU see when you look within? What do YOU feel when you look within?This I believe is the crux of the gnostic and Buddha‚Äôs teaching, to turn back inward to your own experience and to be your own guide through the labyrinth. 

Looking within is not a trap. God created man in his image, and do unto others as you would have others do to you. Those ideas show me that by looking into ourselves, perhaps experiencing some suffering in life, we see that we do not like being treated negatively or controlled, there for not to do it to others. Also I feel parts of the universe repeat themselves like a mathematics fractal, look at sierpinski's triangle for example. Properties of the larger whole are the same properties in the smaller parts. I would like to see anyone argue that the universe is not full of mathematical patterns, whether that be from divine creation or simple nature of matter and reality.To me, properties of god, or Buddha are present in all of us, both good and evil or positivity and negativity. By learning how to control and understand our thoughts and our actions we can dismiss negative thoughts from our mind, leaving only positiveness and noble qualities that improve our lives and effectively all of the lives around us. 

Christianity is basically a way to void and cancel soul-contracts you are unable to NOT make. This is "sin"--to be enslaved to a will other than God.In order to terminate said soul-contract, you have to agree with God's own agreement with Himself through Jesus (essentially, God sees that we are incapable of extracting/extricating ourselves from our bondage to other spirits/archons) and so sends Himself but in human form and provides a eternally valid contract with humanity that allows them to void/terminate contracts with other beings/rulers. By signing onto God' contract, we are able to break out of this cycle, to live in total freedom in God's presence:2 Corinthians 3:17>"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."

It's as simple as intending to and having confidence that it is so (like a god). You can do whatever "magical" ritual you can dig up online, but they are ALL simply means to bolster a belief.But also be aware that it's your higher consciousness that has made these "contracts" or agreements to begin with in the goal of expanding itself thru experience and they are not inherently "bad" whether you like it or not.

"Have no fear for Atomic Energy, cuz none of them can stoppa The Time."

Reincarnation is completely UNNATURAL. It is a massive LIMITATION. Some religions have a few good points you can use. But they are used to ultimately to rope you in. They are all total Mind Control. Humans need to understand that death is non a natural event. It has been programmed into this absurd simulation. You were meant to remain as yourself and expand and create worlds of free expression...

when you feel confident regarding the first article, prepare for part 2. then slowly read and begin to comprehend part 2. this is where the real work occurs. understand it. shape it. make it yours:http://www.ascensionhelp.com/blog/2013/11/21/tell-the-lords-of-karma-that-you-are-sovereign-no-longer-a-lightworker-part-2/

take your time and read these two life changing articles. relax. contemplate. think about what you have read. reach the point where you feel comfortable in understanding them:1) http://www.ascensionhelp.com/blog/2013/08/23/why-i-am-no-longer-a-light-worker/

DMT, LSD, and mushrooms are common.Never tried those. I use Wim Hoff breathing ([guided video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLj9s7xQk4I)) and cold showers. Not baths, showers. You can't drown in a shower.

what are we seeing here?

I am not interested in promoting fear and its limitations. But at this point certain things have to be said. Unfortunately we are in an extremely difficult and for some horrific situation. All angles of these fears need to be addressed and completely understood. This reality is brutally enslaved and has been for a long time. If we are to be truly free there is going to be major emotional and physical challenges on the journey. "It is the only way, but at least there is a way"...

Excellent analysis. Very well stated and brilliant. Here is more on how to tell the Archons you are a Sovereign Being:http://www.ascensionhelp.com/blog/2013/11/21/tell-the-lords-of-karma-that-you-are-sovereign-no-longer-a-lightworker-part-2/

Beautiful metaphor, much like all of our media with the right perspective. Materialism be damned but if there is one thing we haven't really given much thought to, is why we produce movies, shows, music, animation, etc if not to dissect & look into our own collective psyche as a whole.We are the universe looking in on itself. If that universe is a simulation, well, maybe we are hear before existence itself seeking answers for a greater good. Like, for example, avoiding the inevitably of lunacy in a world on the brink of m.a.d.ness.

Fantastic comment, thank you.

Very well written and an excellent metaphor. I'm going to save this comment, thank you for this

As an immortal divine being, you (the larger you) created the Archons and Demiurge. They are part of you and a creation of yours. They're doing a job, sorting, identifying, and quarantining evil, that's why you made them.

Good to see an answer like this. This post seems to have a lot of fear toward something outside themselves.

Are you sure that's the moral? Maybe it's that there's no salvation that can't be had for the asking. You don't need to win favors in Oz to get it. The Scarecrow wasn't merely already smart, he actively *wanted* to be smart. Dorothy didn't happen to already be home, she asked to go home. The power is in the asking, not in some person who promises they can give it to you when they have nothing to offer.

>There is no salvation that you don't already possess.This is the biggest **lie.** Salvation is a free gift given to those that believe! There is no other salvation!

They also turn the friggin frogs gay!

Best, most useful comment so far.  

If we are all just recycled then how does the population grow? Wouldn't we have a stagnant population? Serious question

I don't think rebirth necessitates a forgetting - I believed more advanced souls have a greater memory, I think we all possess memories if only in the forms of habits.

I understand.  I am no longer capable of trusting what I see though.  I dont believe anything.

Yeah by using psychedelics which don't 'take you to another realm' where you see the archons for who they are but rather just alter your thinking so that you hallucinate them.Source: am over the age of 12 and have used psychedelics

Let go of your ego. Submitting to God does not mean being a slave, it means being a son, with all the duties that entails. Moreover you are not free right now. You are a slave to your mind and body. You cannot berate a Christian for being a "slave" without taking a deep look at yourself.

Consider the tone shift from old to new testament. You're dealing with different gods, Yahweh and Ba'al in the old, Jesus in the new.

Bill Cooper:"The Mandaeans, a small but tenacious community which dwells in Iraq, follow an ancient form of Gnosticism, which practices initiation, ecstasy and some rituals which have been said to resemble those of the Freemasons. [And of course they do, because they are. (laughs) In every Masonic temple you will see somewhere up on the wall a big letter 'G'. And you will see it in their symbology, in their books. You will see this letter 'G'. And if you ask a Freemason, being bound by the oath never to tell you or reveal you the secrets to the profane‚Äîwhich is what they call those who are not initiates, or adepts in the Mysteries‚Äîhe will tell you it's for God, but that is a lie. That does not stand for God, for I have researched it deeply, all the way up the ladder of the stages of initiation. And at the top, those adepts known as the Priesthood know this large letter 'G' to represent Gnosticism. And it is an admission that they are indeed the recipients of the ancient Gnostic. They are Gnostics, and they are looking to attain the gnosis, through which they will receive Apotheosis. And they believe that they are the only ones in the world who possess truly mature minds and, thus, the only ones in the world capable of ruling the rest of us, whom they refer to as cattle‚Äîcattle.]"

Why can't the G mean both? I like a lot of Bill Coopers work

I should have said "before" doing it.  My mistake.NASVGenesis 6:5-7Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 The Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved [e]in His heart. 7 The Lord said, ‚ÄúI will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the [f]sky; for I am sorry that I have made them.‚ÄùGenesis 8:21The Lord smelled the soothing aroma; and the Lord said [ao]to Himself, ‚ÄúI will never again curse the ground on account of man, for the [ap]intent of man‚Äôs heart is evil from his youth; and I will never again [aq]destroy every living thing, as I have done.

Yah a NWO....cant wait

September?

Oh. I will check it out. Thank you for the suggestion!

Osama bin Laden had one of his books when he was killed.

hall has some great material. thanks for bringing his work to others.

You cannot be a Gnostic and a Christian at the same time. By that, I take it to mean that your magical or occult system is based on Christian symbology. Very well, but remember, that the occult practices of Gnosticism were forbidden expressly by God in the Bible. They are a false light that will lead you in a dark path; the ultimate 'apple of the eye', the immutable first lie: 'ye shall be as gods'.Tread carefully.

Or be a Bodhisattva and throw yourself into a hell of burning flames the size of a galaxy for the sake of liberating all sentient beings from suffering. 

The Matrix is rewrap of the Hero's Journey and was made purposefully to portrait religious imagery available for anyone.It can even be used to picture some christian analogies. No big deal..

i agree. the first "Matrix" film is basically the story of our horrible situation.

Skepticism was what originally led me to Christianity. While researching the causes of the 2008 economic crisis, I came to realize that the financial system was completely rigged and that those with real power in this world are 100% involved in the occult - to deny these things is to have your head in the sand, basically. When I learned those facts, it then became a moral decision about which side to choose, but the human sacrifice and SRA aspects of occult elite practices made it clear to me that I could only be morally on the opposing side from them. The next question became, "If they are darkness, then what is the light?", and answering that question led me to find what they hate and suppress the most, which is the Bible and most especially the truth of God's only begotten son, Jesus Christ, who gave his life for our sins on the cross, was buried three days and then resurrected. I can say that I was spiritually led in my research, albeit without realizing that until later. Also I can say that the truth was so refreshing that I cried with joy for two hours after realizing that Jesus was real, and I also felt throughout my body and soul that I had come to the ultimate truth after years of searching.

 

Most Christian dogma is based on pagan tradition and designed to control people, and most of the bible was curated by kid fucker priests. So you've gotta take everything with a grain of salt and healthy suspicion.But Jesus is real. The Satanists who planned 9/11 picked that day because the book of Revelations says 9/11 is Jesus's birthday (Christmas is the winter solstice, a pagan holiday). The Satanist bible, the Babylonian Talmud, says Jesus is boiling in excrement in hell. If the people who run (ruin) the world and worship the devil are that concerned with hating Jesus, there's a reason.Jesus (god the son) also represents factthat all of us, despite being created by the creator god (god the father, the demiurge), are all part of the god-source (god the holy spirit, the god of everything). The Christian trinity provides a good working model of the 3 most important deities in Gnosticism. There are many more, and devils and demons.

The issues at work there that you have to keep in mind stems from Catholicism and the Canonization of the Western Bible. Over the past couple millennia the Bible we have access to has been corrupted and twisted quite a bit. The Council of Nicaea in 325AD decided what doctrines would be taught and what Christianity should be. A few decades later, they canonized the Bible and decided what books should and shouldn't be in it.That said, if you look back to our holidays and other events, you'll see they match up with other cultures from the past, which was how the Roman Empire placated the territories they conquered. By having a universal ( definition of Catholic is universal ) church, they told everyone to keep their celebrations, but use our Jesus, Mary, and God as the subjects instead of your current deity or what have you. The Catholic Church took practices and beliefs from what people already believed and twisted Christianity to fit. Best examples are that if you go back and read Christ's messages in the original Greek, he didn't teach Heaven and Hell, or about an immortal soul. That is Greek philosophy and religion with a Jesus veneer. Christ taught life and death only. There isn't a message of fear through the New Testament, not through Christ's teachings.That's how you avoid all the negativity. Read it with an open mind, throw off what you "know" it says and look for the meaning. Read the original texts if you can, because the Dark Ages and the restriction of the Bible from common people really did our world a disservice.

Persecution of religious people. Nazi Germany. Soviet union 20s-80s

That is the same problem I had with the God of the old testament - what kind of God wants blood sacrifices of his own people? Sick. Did you ever wonder why God would need to sacrifice his only son (Jesus) to himself in order to forgive our sins?  That doesn't really make a lot of sense.  Imagine if you are the all powerful God, and the humans you created are sinning, and you feel bad - what do you do to save them? Do you sacrifice your only son to appease yourself and forgive the sins of your creation?  

There are multiple gods. The old testament gods like Yahweh and Ba'al are vengeful. They describe themselves as jealous. Note the tone change with Jesus. He invalidates everything they said.

The Matrix is a deranged self aware predatory A.I. that projects most of this Holographic Reality. The Archons are the top of the hierachy that maintains the Matrix. The Global Elite/Illuminati are the human representatives below the Archons. This Matrix is completely shut off from Eternal "Source Energy". Therefore it is a predatory parasitic system on all levels.

I don't have much problem with animal sacrifices.The killings during the Book of Numbers wars however are emotionally difficult to me.My best bet is the character of God. Since He is just, whatever He has done/is doing/will do, will result in the best outcome in the End of History, though our limited mind and short lifespan is unable to comprehend.One passage that support this is view is the story of Joseph. He was sold by his brothers as a slave in a foreign land and suffered for years, even being made prisoner. And what he did to deserve this? Nothing. If you focus in that period of time, it would made no sense. But if you broaden the scope, you can see this was made to protect the seed of Abraham, as later Joseph became some sort of prime minister and was able to shelter the Israelites from the famine that is described to have occurred at that time.edit: 2 words

What if you substitute the word "god" for nature? Or even reality? Then the stories of plagues and sacrifices start to make more sense. Remember that the bible wasn't written with an understanding of scientific truth.

It's that voice that says I can do it alone. I don't need God or anyone else. While true, what a depressing way of existence. Yes, kill it.

Ah sweet! Thank you so much. 

Thank you for your input. I've never considered the history of it.

Thank you so much.

In short- Lots of research but only after I was approached by a UFO near my apartment(one of the best experiences of my life). Even then I was digging into the matter because I wanted to not only understand what was going on but also why I was being 'attacked' in my sleep.Understandably no one really believes my testimony seeing as I don't have video evidence. Definitely something you have to experience rather than me simply sharing info.To this day I don't look at anything the same anymore.

No I came across it from these people who also have their own YouTube channels:Simon ParkesAlex CollierCorey GoodeDavid WilcockTolec (don't know his real name)Alexandra MeadorsBarbara Marciniakand David Icke.Their matching intel and encounter testimonies along with my own experience sold it for me.I grew up titled 'catholic' but really only considered myself a Christian back then who mocked others for believing in anything else...especially extraterrestrial and extradimensional beings.Fuck that noise. Now I'm more open minded but also remaining levelheaded.

This really resonated with me. Thanks for the message 

factthat the Satanists who run/ruin this world hate Jesus tells me he's real. 9/11 was planned that day because the book of Revelations says that's Jesus' birthday. The Satanist bible, the Babylonian Talmud, says Jesus is boiling in excrement in hell.Even if he weren't real, it's still the perfect metaphor for factthat all of us are part of god.

resonated with me as well

Jesus clarified God's message and love for us.  Jesus is needed because man misunderstood God's message, The Old Testament is full of this misunderstanding especially without any extra texts.  Your post is beautiful and provides a clear way to visualize this.

> The Old Testament and New Testament dovetail together perfectly and are completely compatible.I have an adulterer here. Old Testament tells me to stone her, New Testament says to let he without sin cast the first stone. What do I do with this contradiction? Need advice soon, the roofie Bill Cosby gave her is wearing off.>  "I came not to send peace, but a sword."I love this quote. Fight the evil.

I never understood why all people are not gods chosen people. I've read lots of the old testament and didn't vibe with factthat this god seemed to represent behaviors and actions I don't want in my life.

The sword of Truth and justice. Atomic bombs cannot match her power. Whole nations will kneel. As an aside, why her and not him? I don't know why, but it's definitely a she and the demiurge a he. Granted, two sides of one coin.

Having attended many a church service, it always amuses me when they break bread I mean psilocin ;)

 

That was Robert Monroe who said that. He was describing a Reptilian he saw in the Astral Afterlife.

Pretty sure fucking and killing kids is bad, and bad for us. The gods they're doing it for are bad gods. There are other gods that are not bad (Jesus, angels, etc.). Look for those gods.

Muslims believe them to be real.

Many cultures still believe in demons, for example, Japan; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OniOne could say these are folklore and myth, but the traditions to keep Oni at bay (and other rituals) still occur today.  Some Japanese families even claim descent from oni as well, just like that particular Muslim believed he was descended from Djinn.

 

I think the Matrix uses more references than any film..

Hi. I have been spending most recent nights in the Astral Afterlife and when you return, you are very physically exhausted. I am trying to save someone who was very close to me. This can be very difficult.

things that aren't trump/us politics related. 

I'm not discrediting it by any means and I appreciate the post. It's just a little over the top for someone who does not frequent here.

umm yes.

Have you ever seen an owl without feathers? Pretty demonic looking stuff man. Anyways I just worry about the idea that the creator is our enemy. If he truly was evil, there would be a theoretical situation where 1% actually had a heart and the rest is the like the 1% in actuality, as evil and depraved as they are

I didn't comment about the amount or quality of info here. It just doesnt feel like a discussion to me. Again, i like this subject, im just critiquing the format.Edit: i possibly also have to high of expectations for what counts as a discussion on the internet 

All i see is a bunch of stories with no factual evidence.

They burned the Library At Alexandria because it told the real truth about the "ARCHONS". I have seen high level Jesuits/Catholics on the "other side" (the afterlife). They are Satanists, Molesters and Full Fledged Psychos.

When talking about Judaism and Christianity, please remember to include Islam; all three are from the same Abrahamic religious origins. They differ regarding messianic details, but are inseparable at their cores.

That is from the Old Testament you twit. Who wrote that? 

> No wonder the catholic church killed these people and burned their books, they basically call catholicism satanism!Wouldn't they ultimately be worshiping Jesus, the "light", though? If this is even the slightest bit true, then why would the Demiurge want to split the worship between himself and his estranged son?

This is terrific analysis. I would love to read more of your interpretation of the Gnostic teachings.

Yes. Knowing through logical reasoning demands a frame of reference to base your inferrances upon. However, it's always secondary to direct knowingness, aka intuition. One cannot convey the essence of the statement 'I AM THAT I AM' to just anyone , especially if the other is trying to grasp it in by means of logic. You can't  *explain* Zen or explain *Sophia*. 

what's the fallen universe? 

God isn't pure logic , but he appears as logic as he shines down upon the material world. That-  made me reread your entire post. Nice work!!

Beautiful way of putting it

I believe Saobaoth can be taken as either a spiritually 'awakened' human or a religious figure like Jesus.The idea is that the Demiurge/Yaldabaoth would represent the figure of the vengeful/jealous/rage-filled God of the Old Testament, while Saobaoth is the one who stands up to it and challenges its authority. I'm just using the Judiac-Christian religious system as a guide here, as there are many parallels that could be made in other religions as well. For this tho, the Gnostics in question were from that line of thinking, so forgive any assumptions I may be putting on things here :)

It would be very hard to find the originator of the material... since this is 'mystery school' stuff, it would have already been passed through a few generations of oral tradition at the very least before being written down. For how long the story was told before it was written is unclear, and even the identity of the scribe who did eventually write it down is pretty unclear... We kinda have to take it as anthropology and work from there. These subjects are never going to be a great fit for those who need to be sure about things. There are too many things we just cannot know.

I believe his 'sister' was the will of the Demiurge, who had power over it's own creation (but didn't acknowledge its own creation).I dont' know if it was meant to be an actual sister, or if it was an anthropomorphism of the Demiurge's actions... I'd have to look into it more. If I have a different take i'll try to msg ya... 

Different Gnostics? You did mention the Nag Hamadi Library and while I haven't read it in its entirety (only really the Apocryphon of John and the Gospel of Thomas), I don't think any of the manuscripts talk about a narrative of psychic aliens and an otherworldly intelligence called Gaia. The Apocryphon of John is usually thought to be the most important Gnostic work as it occurs in nearly half of the codices found at Nag Hamadi, and the Gospel of Thomas is the oldest. From which of the Nag Hamadi books are you drawing this narrative?I have taken a great deal of LSD and some mushrooms, but never DMT. 

I think the names change but the archetype is eternal, and an impulse followed to resist that which is abhorrent is always a victory. Good on you. 

Thank you for the leads! I realize I may be succumbing to a false duality in retrospect. I've bookmarked Mr.Lash's site.May I ask- is there a "correct" deity in your opinion? I don't even know what to believe anymore.May I *create* a belief? I'm only asking your opinion of course. I know I can do what I want but... pls elaborate.Is the Judaic God simply a demiurge? I feel that term may be a corrosive meme. Or is it truth?

I agree. I think it's a cycle designed for the the utility of negative energy farming. We incarnate, we get traumas. They give us fears, emotional reactions to our experiences, even unconscious ones. That fear cuts us off from joy. It also makes us act out in poor ways. This can cause us to earn bad karma. Then after we die we are told we have bad karma and need to go back to life, knowing we will be traumatized, in order to pay off the karma. We reoffend and repeat over and over again.We are told we need contrast to even appreciate good at all as an explanation for why these useless eater beings exist, causing suffering and dysfunction. Yet, when we look at the best preexisting tests for this idea, the undeveloped, we see contradiction. Traumatized animals and children do not have greater happiness. They are plagued by negative emotion and lack of joy. They are damaged beings. The happiest ones have the best upbringings. Prisons are full of damaged people, not ecstatic experiencers of contrast. We are told that without the dark beings we would be stagnant, or too slow in developing. Yet, we have billions of years to evolve and a vast sea to evolve inside. We will discover new things and integrate them into our civilization. We don't need adversaries to evolve. Some that call themselves light sell these dark beings as a catalyst for our evolution. I wish they'd just get a room with that catalyst themselves. Then they could tell us how they liked it and I wouldn't be offended. Some of the light also says that without the dark influence, we wouldn't even have free will choice. They define it basically as being tempted to do wrong, causing a more interesting (for them) experiences to watch. Yet, we perceive that having a lack of this interference is more freedom than having it. We see free will choice as self-determination, not a balance of malevolent and benevolent influence. We enjoy having joy, peace, freedom and harmony. When we go to the movies to watch other people, like those who may be watching us, we want disharmony, conflict, struggles for freedom and troubled characters. Think about it. Our self-interests are opposed to those who would be watching us for entertainment, if they were like us.Beware that the light is the best place for the dark to hide, because it gives them great access to our trust and consent. Furthermore, if they can make us feel betrayed by the light, they not only get negative energy for it, but they cause us to be more separated from genuine benevolent beings by belief in their insidiousness. 

I'd like to know what you consider the most convincing evidence *for* your worldview (which I've come to know over the months that I've read your posts and comments on Reddit)?  I've read a large number of NDE accounts, various channeled material, orthodox religious interpretations, and assorted other opinions.  (Orthodox religious interpretations would be the least trustworthy for obvious reasons, but in the case of, e.g. Tibetan material, they do provide some relevant data in my opinion).  While some of these sources do support your perspective (or close to it), most of them do not.  In particular, a majority of NDE accounts seem to stress not only the positive nature of the experience, but a very deep *knowing* that seems to suggest great discernment and a deep level of "experiential" knowledge.  Of course, they could all be being deceived, but on the other hand, so could you.  I'm interested because obviously one wants to get it "right".  If walking into the light is the same as walking into a trap, one would obviously not want to do that.  But if you *don't* walk into the light, what happens to you then?  I think this last question really needs to be answered if one is going to accept the idea that aliens use the white light to steal or recycle souls.I don't mean to be critical here, I really want to know what you think, since (in this sub anyway) you seem to be one of the most consistent and passionate advocates for your worldview.

I don't disagree, but I find your interpretation overly negative. This reality is a minimum security prison, but that's not necessarily bad. Prisons have a purpose. This one is a place to determine which parts get to return to "society" (heaven or god-source) and which parts need to go to maximum security (hell).We aren't discrete souls, we are scoops of soul soup that get mixed around in reincarnation. You can talk to other beings because we are all part of the same whole, ladled out. We keep getting ladled into this prison so the sorting algorithm can keep running.The Archons that run this process, while undeniably evil, are serving a purpose. They are the wardens of this prison and of the super-max of hell. I like to ignore them, do the work I'm here to do in this life, and I look forward to this whole thing getting done and going home.

Elaborate on personal soul retention, if you will. How do you assure your soul is yours?

You might never get to find out. A brief look at history will tell you so. Not at events but at the creation of certain aspects of humanity.What changes as you go across the world?Government. Religion. Currency. Language.The last one being the most important. Where did language come from? Search and search and you won't find an answer. You find that out... you crack the code. Forget the moon. Forget the Bermuda triangle. You can't even tell me who gave you the gift of speech. It was given to you, remember that.However they say the creation of language predates written word, so we'll never know who gave it to all of us.It's how we introduce every single human being into our societies. Language. Ever read those rare stories about "feral children" and how they have trouble adapting language and integrating into society?You can't even begin to imagine the mind-fuck it would be living in the wild, free from other human beings, and then coming into a society and seeing all the layers of history and creation of who? Man. All of a sudden, every aspect of your life is controlled and given to you by another human being? With zero agency? The first thing they'll teach a feral child is language, otherwise they won't be able to grasp government, currency, technology, etc.As human beings, we are animals. We deny this heavily, and bring it up only when we have to. We are human beings and we are animals. Just like the gorilla and the monkey and the rat. We are taught. We run through mazes, experience pain, learn behavioural patterns.The Bible fucks up and discredits itself in its very first book, Genesis. It says... God _spoke_ the universe into existence...Find where language comes from. I have no idea, but if you do, PM me and tell me.Where does language come from? Where oh where?

Sure, but at the deepest level of being, we are indestructible.  Thus, the harm that "evil" may inflict is only "temporary" (properly understood outside of the concept of time, which is a property of our realm but not Ultimate Reality).  So, yes, "you" can become overly fascinated with the physical realm, the astral realms (lower and upper), and play the game of Heaven and Hell for aeons if you like.  But ultimately "evil" is a portion of the god-source, and must ultimately return to it. I am not denying the quarantine aspect of Hell, in fact I think it follows automatically and almost mechanically by virtue of the instantaneous nature of manifestation within the astral realm.  There is no way for "good" and "evil" to mix in the astral realm because they would instantly sort themselves.  However, the astral realm is ultimately also illusory, it's just the next level "up" in the order of Being.

 

Can you elaborate?

>who have encountered malevolent beings on DMTThey were more "annoyed" that I had the audacity to peer beyond the veil and accompanied me on my return. Most beings I've encountered are benevolent.

Off topic, but I wish I could find some DMT!

Except Hubbard decided to found Scientology on a wager with his friends on who could start a successful religion...

It's not well confirmed, but it seems to be a good indicator of where things are heading. If that is the plan, they seem to be doing a good job following it.

> Sometimes I think to myself ‚ÄúWhat if meditation is actually a ploy to stop people from actively participating and paying attention to how much their getting fucked over by a corrupt system that is slowly taking over? What if meditation/looking within, actually makes a person docile and inactive and has been promoted for this purpose?‚Äù> Slavoj Zizek discusses this at large. Here's a summary I found in [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/mar/22/western-buddhism): "Western Buddhism presents itself as a remedy against the stresses of modern life though, as Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek has noted, it actually functions as a perfect supplement to modern life. It allows adherents to decouple from the stress, whilst leaving the causes of the stress intact: consumptive forces continue unhindered along their creatively destructive path. In short, Buddhism is the new opium of the people."

Being a guide requires a compass and a map. Having a compass requires there to be a fixed set of principles upon which it works, where you can always find true north no matter what you're feeling. So to be your own guide requires you to be the one guided, the compass, the map, and the true north. This last, especially, is the problem with being your own guide. It actually leads to relativism rather than discovery of truth, if the true north is defined as being whatever you find when you look inside yourself. What you find there may not be the truth.Just my 2c.

Lol yeah I don't buy that shit. Looks like you're giving me two options. Be a slave to the archons who god made if he made everything. Or be a slave to God through some convoluted bullshit that involves human sacrifice. Has it ever occurred to you that Jesus Christ is Lucifer? And I always find it curious that people who claim to follow Jesus quote Paul who Jesus warned would come after him and was a wolf in sheeps clothing. 

Can we get an answer from the person that actually posted about the soul contracts and not the threads hijacker?

Found the religious moron. Please let OP answer.

"In order to cancel your contract with 'Pepsi', you must make a contract with 'Coke'. "

Never said contracts were bad. But generally speaking being deceived into a contract doesn't mean that it actually benefits me. Contracting with the government comes to mind here. It benefits them most of the time. I think having sex is one of the reasons I personally incarnate into this shit show over and over. But I think I'm done after this life. Not coming back. 

Won't you help to sing...

i think i agree with you about expanding and creating worlds of free expression. i disagree with your view on the sinister nature of religion (i think that's what you're getting at?). really, i think any "sinister" force is based on fear/ignorance.how do you believe we are to gain control of ourselves and stop dying?

Thanks for sharing.So glad this round table is happening...this is the best of /r/conspiracy.

I have read the article you linked years ago and it certainly influenced my previous post. "Tell the Lords of Karma that you are sovereign" is a must read for any beginner Gnostic.Also check "Tricked by the Light" as it goes hand in hand with "Lords of Karma."http://www.trickedbythelight.com/tbtl/index.html

 

Just food for thought. If god source split itself, I don't feel like all of those pieces are existing here on earth in the now... As a Mahayana buddhist, I believe there are many thousands or millions of worlds both similar and different from our own. Thus, we  fractions of god-source here on earth do not add up to the whole of 1, all spirits on earth are more like .000001% of that god-source with worlds numerous both in this universe and in other dimensions.Basically one world in another dimension may be contracting to make up for an increase in individual souls here on earth. Each individual goes through birth and death, but so do civilizations and other worlds. Think bigger. What has been revealed is but a tiny glimpse of true knowledge. By the way, these Buddhist ideas are different from traditional Buddhism (Theravada). These ideas come mostly from the Lotus Sutra, considered scripture of the Buddha by Mahayana but not Theravada.

I get that. Sometimes there are physical signs as well. Look for the good ones, not the bad.

I've been a Christian. I was a slave to dogma. It made me fear the wrath of God. It made me fear questioning the faith. After I plowed through that fear and changed my beliefs and I no longer have the fear.I now know so much more about the attributes that come with slave seeking individuals. The God of the old testament is a slave seeker, no doubt about it. A slave seeker is the antithesis of the message of Jesus.Jesus would have us treat others the way we would want to be treated. Slave seekers want exactly the opposite. They want others to be their servants. No being that acts this way is worth interacting with. They usually deceive and undermine free will in order to achieve slavery for others and utility for the self. There are many beings like this that do it in a small way. They are like parasites, wanting others to carry a burden for them.I believe in a God and as I learn more about what he could be, the more I think I come to see things as he might. Know thyself. As you know more about yourself, you will know more about others. Understanding is an effective lubricant for forgiveness. It does wonders for me.As you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back into you. What does this mean? God is all things. As you seek God, God turns your mind inward, examining yourself. For you are God. God wants you to awaken to your truth and be your true self. God is also like a mirror, reflecting back in subtle ways that which is out of integrity with yourself and the whole. If you want to be a parasite, as I mentioned earlier, you will find yourself around other parasites that will treat you the way you treat others. If there were only a few individuals, this reflective property of existence would be obvious. The size of the container and the buffer of those who disagree with you shield you from a quicker reflection.With wisdom, there is no going back. 

Jesus is not God. He is a messenger of a way of life that supports life and consciousness that came to an environment owned by anti-life, self-serving, self-superior, soul sucking abominations that in the modern day we call reptilians, but back then we called demons.The reptilians want to teach us to be just like them, so that we can become their slaves. Their self-serving way of life is predictable. Seek gain, avoid loss and calculate risk without letting concern for others get in the way of personal advantage. So more intelligent beings on this path can easily control less intelligent beings on the same path, with rewards and punishments. These beings are owned by a combination of technology and parasitic life, working as a hive, to create a vortex of value feeding the hive and its top leadership. They are the ultimate useless eaters. You could call the hive mind and its top leadership Satan if you want. Yet, you're better off knowing more of what they really are than having some kind of mystical fear. They are what would happen to us if we let psychopaths rule us into the ground. They will abuse technology to control us and use fear to control us. They will no doubt delve into mind control and other free will subverting activities. Eventually, the race will bend to their will, accepting instructions from the technology and become very much like this hive of reptiles. They want us to do this and then they'll just hack and hijack it, adding us as slaves. They feed on fear and suffering, because they absorb the energy of joy that others give off in negative emotional states. They look fearsome and disgusting, because then they can just be present and cause their hosts to immediately start radiating this energy. They evolve to be energy thieves essentially and when they have complete free reign, they often create environments that resemble hell, with torture and gore. It's like nose candy to a coke head for them. It's even more like sucking blood. One gets weaker while the other gets stronger. They are below worthless parasites. A rock or a pile of feces has more ultimate value for consciousness, if you think about it.   

bill cooper was incorrect on many things. i personally feel he is completely wrong on this.

actually it could. it does not make the gnostics bad. it just means both groups seek "knowledge"

Thank you.Doesn't this say that God was only upset He had destroyed other living beings due to man's actions? But the punishment towards man was still just?

Bad news, the guys pushing the NWO are kid fucking Satanist demons, so it's unlikely they're shooting for Heaven on earth. I think he's saying we need to stop them.

The time between the eclipse August 21 and the celestial alignment September 23 are of great interest to many people.

Killed? By whom? Now I this is off topic but surely you dont believe that BS? Anyway let us return to the main topic which is very interesting 

Have you looked into Valentinus? How can a man be Gnostic and almost be pope? A knowledge system is defined by the times. What is Truth becomes heresy. The message however, remains True. Truth does not change.

This. Those who live life focused on service of others will probably end up becoming Boddhisatvas and either sacrifice themselves, as you stated, or come back to Earth to liberate others. 

This is EXACTLY how my thought process worked. I reverse engineered the situation to find the truth. Look at what the evil elite are censoring the most and there is your truth. 

This is what did it for me. They didn't build a 40 foot owl statue at Bohemian Grove, just for fun. They didn't build a child rape island with an owl temple in the Caribbean for fun. They didn't kill 3 thousand people on Jesus' birthday, 9/11, just for fun. They didn't build a sculpture of Jesus in a nuclear explosion in the papal auditorium for fun.Our world is run by Satanists and demons. For now.

> Skepticism was what originally led me to Christianity.I've heard this a lot, even my own pastor. Isn't it funny how when people genuinely try to disprove the Bible, they often end up realizing that it is actually the perfect inerant Word of God, just as it says it is? The Bible has stood the test of time, and does not cave under enormous pressure like other religious books do. Like you, I believe I have been (still am) supernaturally lead to discover hidden truths in this world. It should be fairly evident to anyone on this sub that the rulers of this world are literal satanists whom are beyond wicked. If you come to the conclusion there is true diabolical Evil in this world (and unseen forces behind it), then you can't help but ask what the other side is. Sometimes first finding the darkness will lead you to the light. I learn the HARD way, so it's not terribly surprising.**In the lies, you can find the truth. With the truth, you can see all the lies.**

Interesting! Thanks for the reply. Could you speak more to your feeling of the suppression of Christianity? Not sure if your American, but I've always felt like the prevalence of Christian morality (specifically puritanical morality) in our government and in our society is one of the biggest blights on the American people. Once again, we've just used similar paths to arrive to very different conclusions, and I think this is super interesting. 

>  those with real power in this world are 100% involved in the occultPlease don't downvote me for asking this, but can you provide any sources or evidence of this?

as a Christian, (also) I can say that I respectfully disagree with the majority of your statements.> I personally view the old testament as a reference and nothing more (other than the 10 commandments). The world was a VERY different place back then and different spiritual laws applied.The OT has incredible amounts of truth that are still just as valid today as they were back then, particularly if you choose to ask the Lord for wisdom about prophecy. You will be taken on a ride ALL over the Bible, and find verses that you didn't even know existed that have profound meaning to this day. His Word is timeless. That being said, I understand it is a Book of so many layers, connections, cross-references, puzzle pieces and encrypted information (purposefully) it staggers the mind when you begin to see them. Supernatural and divine origin becomes the only plausible, rational and logical explanation (not to mention the supernatural experiences that come with it when the reality around you begins to change accordingly to earnest prayer requests being answered according to His will at His time)Ironically the truth is even the 10 commandments are done away with the Mosaic law, (including the 4th commandment & observing the Sabbath) and have been replaced with the New Covenant of Jesus Christ that believers today are under. There are only TWO laws:**1) Love God.** **2) Love others.** (*paraphrasing*)IF you keep the second law, you CANNOT break the 10 commandments. You cannot Love & Murder someone simultaneously, now can you? Same for stealing, adultery, etc. The Mosaic law existed for a purpose, and created a Covenant people through whom Jesus and his pure bloodline is traced perfectly (God ensured he was not part of the serpent seed genetic line, since Jesus had to remain sinless, and perfectly pure and adhere to the Mosaic law 100% in order to fill the requirement of the Law, in order to do away with it and open the doors to all people solely through Faith, and Faith alone. 9 out of the 10 commandments are also repeated throughout the New Testament as well, except for the 4th.> the Bible is 2000 years oldThat would be the New Testament. The Bible as a whole is more like 3,500 years old, and written/compiled over 1,500 years through 40+ different authors (keep in mind ALL were divinely inspired, and every original word is the Word of God). The authors of the books/letters still retained their own unique personalities and writing styles which you can see throughout.

*None* of that shit makes sense. Anyone with even a basic understanding of how logic works can see that the Bible is nonsense. It's a tool for control and nothing else. I can't believe how many people here believe in this shit when religion is literally the oldest fucking conspiracy ever lol. 

> That is the same problem I had with the God of the old testament - what kind of God wants blood sacrifices of his own people?He never asked for sacrifices of His own people, that is the devil whom deceives fools into sacrificing themselves or their children. The blood sacrifices were of ANIMALS to atone for the sin of His people. The wages of SIN is death. Period. Something MUST die, be it animal, human, or God Himself who manifested Himself as Jesus to provide the final, ultimate perfect sacrifice so that the old sacrificial system could be done away with once and for all.> Did you ever wonder why God would need to sacrifice his only son (Jesus) to himself in order to forgive our sins? That doesn't really make a lot of senseIt begins to make perfect sense when you understand that there is DIVINE LAW in existence, that God Himself made. He WILL NOT break His OWN LAW!! Therefore he did what was necessary in order to fulfill the own law and provided a PERFECT final blood sacrifice of Himself as Jesus. Jesus Christ **IS** God, they are the same. Jesus is Yahweh/Jehovah.  Christ is a title, not a name. Same as Messiah.Along with divine law, there are structures of things in place that must be adhered to in order for certain possibilities to remain true. For instance, you cannot have true, genuine LOVE, without FREE WILL. Love must be a choice the person makes, NOT through forced submission or conformity. God has no interest in puppets on a string, or "cookie-cutter" Christians. Individuality is huge to Him and is valued greatly.God wants those whom truly, genuienly Love Him and want to spend eternity with Him, the Creator of everything seen and unseen in our universe, and everything beyond it. If you don't want to live forever in an absolute paradise that is unfathomable to our pathetic little minds, that is indeed your choice. Actually it is the default choice. Contrary to what many will say, there are only TWO paths. Up or Down. That's it. Only two. There are NOT many ways to God or Heaven. There is ONE and ONE only, through Faith in Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice and His ressurection from the dead that awaits all of us whom have humbled ourselves, admitted ourselves as sinners, and asked for forgiveness. If you don't want eternal life with the God of the Bible... well then He will grant you that wish too. The thing is, when you finally realize that it was a mistake, it will be too late by then. You will forever be spiritually seperated from God, for without Him, nothing can exist. In other words, you will simply be deleted and it will be as if you never existed, and no one will remember you or your name (after the punishment in Hell for your crimes is fulfilled, that is. Hell is a TEMPORARY place that is a prison for spirits, think of it as a jail for criminals to serve their time in, only ramped up to x1000 and full of demonic spirits that ABSOLUTELY LOATHE AND HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT HUMANS. Soon Hell, along with Death will be done away with for all eternity.)**OR** you can be "Saved" through Salvation from the Faith in Jesus Christ brings. All your sins (crimes) will be cast away, all past, present and even future that you haven't even committed yet. (God is outside of time, created it actually, and already knows exactly everything you are going to do. Having knowledge of what someone WILL do, does not take away from factthat they had the FREE WILL to do it in the first place). Again, the choice is ours. Each of us must choose, but time is indeed running out . . .

A lot of the bible has been changed negatively. Don't take it so literally. 

 

I generally agree with this, but we're not completely cut off. You can still connect. It's just hard, although people are waking up. 

 

No problem. I belong to Sumafi. I align most with Sumari. To me , just from gathering information from how and what you posted, I feel you belong Tumold and you align Sumafi.

Thanks for participating and happy cake day :D

Because the Bible was written by ancient racists with esoteric knowledge for sheep. That's why it's so insistent you stfu and suck god's dick and question nothing. The keys to understanding Proto-Indo-European cosmology and its mysteries don't require you to believe any of the Anunnaki nonsense you read in the Bible. Yahweh is a fraud and his book was written by frauds.

A lot of people have different beliefs about Jesus.  That's mine.  It makes the most sense, IMO.  Do you really think he had "magic God powers"?Also, look up John Allegro.  There is scholarly evidence that the Bible is referring to Jesus being a mushroom.  I think the texts alternate back and forth between Jesus being the mushroom, and Jesus being a guy handing out mushrooms.

Since we are in this universe, we see things close to god as good, and far away as bad, but is it because we are trapped or that's how it's supposed to be?

Fair enough. Odd concept though

Christians follow Christ and his Father.

Generally accepted amongst people who subscribe to gnosticism for sure. There are far more people in the Abrahamic religions

haha. i find it amusing that my posts immediately get downvoted. sorry to break it to the "Archons" and the human sellouts that serve them:  In your relentless need to enslave, you have awoken a group of great beings with limitless potential !

Is there a way to save them? May I ask what you've been doing to try? I hope it works out for you, Astral. Hang in there. 

Ah, well anything on conspiracy that isn't u.s related has my interest. Sort of

It boils down to why there is evil in the world. What's your take?

The creator made us in his image. He's not 100% our enemy, but like people, he can be friend, enemy, or something in between.

If you don't see it, create it. <3 

What are you using to see things on the other side? 

I would like to read more details on your experiences and visions If possible, seriously. 

Can you go into more detail on that? What do you see? And how do you get there? And where and how did you find out how to get there?

I was always under the impression that it was Julius Cesar or the Muslim conquest that destroyed the Library at Alexandria. One of the other theories is about Pope Theophilus of Alexandria. But he was *not* Catholic. He was a pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church which is again, not Catholic. 

Not really. They all *claim* to serve the same God. But they hold irreconcilable worldviews.For example, Islam and Judaism are unitarian while most christians are trinitarians. Islam teaches salvation tru obedience of Law. Judaism doesn't  have the concept of Salvation. Christianity teaches salvation comes tru faith..Just to mention a few..

Uh, Islam is probably the least relevant thing to Gnosticism. Islam was founded roughly six hundred years after Christianity and a LONG time after Judaism. Gnosticism was (barely) active for maybe 100 or 150 years during the early period of Christianity (commonly 30AD to 325AD) and after that was pretty much forgotten until its modern discovery a hundred years or so ago. By the time Islam was around Gnosticism had already come, gone, and been forgotten. It is not relevant at all. Muslim scholars wouldn't have even known what Gnosticism was and even if they had would have abhorred it as they did all forms of mysticism.

No. As they worshipped a man who died and came back to life. Some gnostic texts reference christ being pure light and not a human... So essentially christianity warped the true story and created something evil. Every church has a cross which they kill christ on...The church isn't a building of stone were people pray in public.. Even early references to christ around his time mention him as an old man. 

There are many interpretations of Gnosticism.  Some are more mythological and literal, like Sophia sinning by disobeying God and Demiurge being the product of that.  But metaphorically its more like Sophia is a phenomenon, which, as it interacts with other aspects of God in certain ways, produces the material world.  That's just how I interpret it.

Nevertheless, Sophia and Logos are consorts

Look up Philo of Alexandria and Logos.  This was pre Christian Jews and also non-Jew Greeks speculating about the "son of god".

The son sounds like Adam. In Genesis, the creator creates earth and then creates the first being in his own image, to rule over the earth. This means that man was created in the image of the Demiurge, which is close enough to being his son. This is backed up by the way that "in his image" is immediately followed by stating that man is to rule over the physical world, just like the Demiurge. The son being shown Sophia's light is the same as Adam eating from the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.The son becomes aware of his father's origin after he is enlightened by Sophia, and the Demiurge also becomes very jealous of his son and starts attacking him; Adam becomes aware of the Evil in the creator's world, and the creator subsequently kicks Adam out and starts punishing mankind.

> I don't think any of the manuscripts talk about a narrative of psychic aliens and an otherworldly intelligence called Gaia. I highly recommend reading, On the Origin of the World and The Hypostasis of the Archons. There are several translations here;  http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/nhlcodex.htmlThese texts go into detail about the aborted shadow-mass, the Demiurge, his creations (the Archons, "described as soulless beings or astral-mental parasites that "exaggerate human error and intrude upon humanity by psychic stealth in order to propagate the ideological virus of redemptive religion.") and much more.Not many are mentioning in Not in His Image, the concept of 'redemptive religion' as a virus.  He makes lots of good points.

Isn't there a whole book about the Sophia mythology? Lash dissects it in his book, and there are YouTube videos, etc....Sorry for the slow response, but I'm very interested in this subject.

 

I think we should work with psychedelics, have authentic spiritual experiences, and search for the truth ourselves. Of course, there's a truth out there, and I think the Gnostic material is really interesting to consider, not necessarily accept. I think we live in a universe teeming with intelligence, some with very divine intention, some with very evil intention, and some that may not be easily categorized as good or evil. Remote viewing seems to be real, and there are clearly many dimensions, so the forces we're dealing with may or may not be terrestrial.I'm glad this conversation is going on. 

> I think it's a cycle designed for the the utility of negative energy farming.Why would such a process exist? Why would energy vampires exist? Why would someone create such a thing?What if these archons, despite being evil, serve a purpose? They were created to take all the negativity, evil, fear, pain, and they eat it up, suck it up like a karmic vacuum cleaner. Then they keep it bagged up (hell) so that the evil "dirt" isn't littered all over.I'm not saying to sympathize. They are evil. But I don't hate them, because they feed on and are hate. I don't want to feed or emulate them. But they will do their job, and I will do mine.

Damn.

If you don't walk into the light, what can possibly happen to you? Something bad? Why would something bad happen to a divine being, an innocent soul? I think the only reason something like that would scare someone is because they do not trust in themselves. Zen masters urged people to completely trust in themselves. Autonomy. Our experiences on Earth make us think we must trust in something other than ourselves. Think about it.

Although I feel that 99% of NDE are B.S. propaganda and advertising to deceive humanity. Here is one very interesting NDE. The man dies and two non physical humans desperately try to save him from the White Light Trap. He leaves them and goes upwards and ends up in a room with 12 robed beings who are by their description certainly sound like aliens. http://www.near-death.com/experiences/notable/brian-krebs.html

The problem is you do not finish and "go home". You get your Memory Erased and are Forced To Reincarnate over and over. It never ends. This simulation serves no purpose other than the ability of Parasitic Aliens to  harvest loosh energy. Does a cow want to be kept in a pen for a few years and then be brutally slaughtered, over and over into infinity? Is that cow "balancing karma" and "learning lessons"? No. Is the cow allowed to educate itself and live in peace? Is the cow allowed to explore and create other realms? Is the cow allowed to keep its knowledge and memories to develop as an eternal expanding being? The cow is being used as a harvested resource and nothing more. The cow is the same as the "goyim". Humanity is seen as cattle and nothing more...

It starts out as yours, in the majority of cases.  I'm actually not sure what the exact rules are.

How does "the Bible eff up" in that regard. I'm of the belief science and religion aren't separate but can run concurrent to each other. Even if you are atheist though I don't get how God speaking earth into existence is a contradiction? 

Did you find out yet?

Love your response. It's great to see more people seeing this true nature of ourselves.

I kind of get this with Salvia. They are more annoyed with my clinging to my programming than having slipped through. I don't consider them malevolent though. 

 

 

 

that seems directly on topic!

Well the most successful religion, id hope, stems from universal and/or historical truths.Theres also the possibility this is hearsay (or plain disinformation) although ive no evidence either way.  Sounds like its not on any official record, but correct me if im wrong.Note im not a proponent of scientism, just sensitive to anything that seems smeared by the mainstream lately.

> Being a guide requires a compass and a map. Having a compass requires there to be a fixed set of principles upon which it works, where you can always find true north no matter what you're feeling. So to be your own guide requires you to be the one guided, the compass, the map, and the true north. This last, especially, is the problem with being your own guide. It actually leads to relativism rather than discovery of truth, if the true north is defined as being whatever you find when you look inside yourself. What you find there may not be the truth.> Just my 2c.What is truth north to you? And what is it that decides if it has found it or not?Does not the recognition of true north come from within? For example, does 2+2 = 4 because you were told it does, or was there some point where you ‚Äúgot it‚Äù, a realization that occurred in which the truth suddenly became self-evident? Looking within is arguable one of the most ambiguous statements of all time, and is ripe for misunderstanding.   I can only defend what I mean by looking within and being my own guide, and what I mean is using your own intuitive sense of what is true by examining closely all phenomena that arises in the mind objectively.  What I certainly don‚Äôt mean is that whatever you find when you look inside yourself is true. In fact, at least in the Vipassana tradition, it is precisely the opposite. By looking inside you see how temporary and impermanent so much of the phenomena we have come to think of as ‚Äòtrue‚Äô really are (i.e., thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.,), and that there is much more going on on a very subtle level, the experience of which forces us to expand our understanding of what we truly are and what we can experience.  But at the end of the day this is all just words. Realization of truth isn‚Äôt words, it‚Äôs intuition, and it comes from within.At least that is how it appears to me. I speak of course form my current level of ignorance. 

Shrug. I have studied gnosticism. I've read the gnostic gospels--the gospel of thomas, judas etc. I've studied and read greek. I've talked, studied and been throughout the middle east learning religion. I've done drugs and experimented. I'm in seminary. I know my shit.> Be a slave to the archons who god made if he made everything. Or be a slave to God through some convoluted bullshit that involves human sacrifice.Slave? No. Servant? Yes. I choose to be a servant to God because I have experienced God/a presence/being that has changed me and made me better. I am a nicer, kinder, more patient, more generous, humble and peaceable person because I know Jesus and Jesus is my friend. I love Jesus with all my heart. Reading the gnostics and finding out "secret knowledge" doesn't help me. Gnosticism says that you will know if it's true or not, after you die but Gnosticism doesn't help me TODAY. Jesus does. Knowing Mohammad hasn't change me like that. When I pray to "Allah" described in the Qur'an, the "god" presence feels "real" but far off. When I pray to Jesus/Yeshua/Iesso/Hesus" the God that was far off becomes near.>Or be a slave to God through some convoluted bullshit that involves human sacrifice.You're looking at it like God sacrificing a human. It's the other way around. God allows humanity to kill (sacrifice) God. This breaks the system and provides a way out. 

Christianity has many gods, but focuses on 3.* God the father: demiurge, creator god, both good and bad.* God the son: Jesus, an example that all people are derived from and part of god-source.* God the holy spirit: the god-source from which all demi-gods, people, matter, energy, and thought derive. Infinite, which means infinitely good and infinitely bad.God-source created "god" (demiurge, creator god, Yahweh) to manage this little sorting algorithm we live in. God-source created the archons to be like wardens, finding evil, pain, and fear, and throwing it into prison (hell).Once the sorting is done, hell gets to go be hell in quarantine, and the rest of us return to god-source. We're not slaves, we're experiencing the sorting algorithm so we can go back to what we really are, but with good and evil separated. 

Should look into gnosticism. 

I thought about this too. If JC is almighty then he should be able to off Lucifer.. Unless Lucifer is also God or working with....

To be fair, Christ was not Lucifer.  Lucifer had control of the temples, and has control of Christianity.  In church, most of Christ's teachings are brushed aside to make way for the words of his disciples.

Good point

 

> "In order to cancel your contract with 'Pepsi', you must make a contract with 'Coke'. "The metaphor works better if Coke was more powerful than the multiverses while Pepsi only had normative extra-dimensional abilities.

all religion and any system of "hierachy" is essentially "archonic". they manipulate both sides, "sinister" and what on the outside appears to be "good". we must understand that "THOUGHT" is the ultimate force above all. thought slows down to create "energy". energy slows down to create the illusion of "matter". sickness and death are not our nature. they are matrix programs written by satanic aliens known as "ARCHONS". the greatest skill and ability in a so called "physical reality" is VISUALIZATION. if you can, practice seeing objects and events in your "minds eye" as well as with open eyes. become an expert. become a master of "visualization". humanity became lazy and massively atrophied. the matrix projected scenes for us. unfortunately these became scenes of poverty, sickness and death. we can and will change this. you have the unlimited ability to SELF PROJECT worlds of pure beauty and kindness...

I agree, I love that this idea is happening. I don't understand at all why people think this idea would kill this sub. I'm loving this

Thanks that is an excellent website with great information. You may also find this article interesting. "Aliens That Appear As False Light Beings":http://howtoexitthematrix.com/2016/11/12/aliens-that-appear-as-light-false-light-beings/

Mahayana buddhist here... I have the "Tibetan book of the dead" at home, admittedly I haven't read it cover to cover, but I feel I can explain some things...My understanding is that for a month or 40 days after death, you go through a specific variety of realms or experiences upon death, I don't remember most of them but the idea is that they are drastically different from one another, a few repeat similar concepts like you go through a smoky realm and a clear realm and a realm of no visibility at all and stuff like that. You will visit hell like realms and heaven like realms but all that you experience should be considered a test of sorts.You are not supposed to become attached or caught up in any of these realms, that is the truth no matter which one you are in. Various beings or guardian spirits will tempt you in many ways with riches, with false promises of enlightenment, in some experiences the being will be wrathful and threatening and the main point is that all these guardians are trying to lure you, trick you, give you delusions and confuse you from true enlightenment.Also I remember that you will be tempted,  and led into confusion by your 6 senses and that all you experience should be thought of like an illusion. Another main point that's interesting, your sense of time will not be the same at all. Even though all these experiences take place in the span of around 40 days, some experiences or realms will feel like you have been there for thousands of years. Surprise! So overall it's very confusing, but Tibetan Buddhism suggests that you should not believe any of it, don't get attached to anything and follow the teachings to cut out delusions and avoid becoming trapped in one of these realms. The Tibetan science of death makes sense in many ways, perhaps we are in a complex farm or soul trap of sorts, but basically everything you experience will be pretty unpredictable after death and with the difference in time-frame and numerous different experiences and it's not surprising that these things lead us into confusion and result in not remembering our previous life and experiences when we reincarnate.I can look over my book tonight and I have been wanting to post more about this topic and my experiences. 

> Do the elite bloodlines have a trick that retains spiritual memoryI remember reading somewhere that ancient Egyptian Priests were able to identify when/whom they would reincarnate into (with intent).  

Good point 

!RemindMe 27 days

If you read the original PIE (closer to age of the Anunnaki and Igigi) myths of the serpent and the tree, you realize knowledge is the fruit of the tree of life, and the serpent *guards* it and eats it for himself, he doesn't entice men toward it.The Hebrew myths are a bastardization written for sheep to keep them from realizing the truth. PIE language and religion scattered the world as the false gods subverted our attempts to understand our true divine nature. This is the real Tower of Babel, and why basically all IE cosmologies point to the same truth.

I feel like true enlightenment takes a lot of time and lifetimes of practice in general, but that rewards for following the Buddhist path will be substantially beyond our expectations in the long run.Being a bodhisattva is the highest form of the path from my perspective and will lead to swift enlightenment in a fraction of the lifetimes or in just one. Teaching others how to find happiness is true Buddhism. 

Me as well. The only reason I did not succumb to atheism was that I saw the great works of evil done by our elites and saw the mark of the Devil behind them.That alone can fuel a faith. 

Ive heard 12-25 isnt actually Jesus' birthday but how do you know it was actually 9-11? Genuinely curious, thank you in advance.

> Isn't it funny how when people genuinely try to disprove the Bible, they often end up realizing that it is actually the perfect inerant Word of God, just as it says it is? The Bible has stood the test of time, and does not cave under enormous pressure like other religious books do. The bible has been heavily edited, over millennia, by pagans, satanists, and kid fucking priests. It talks about human and animal sacrifice (Abraham's son and Jezebel's sacrifice to Yahweh and Ba'al). The old testament god refers to himself as a jealous god. It says you will go to hell for wearing blended clothing (60/40 non-iron shirts), getting a tattoo, or eating a bacon cheeseburger.There's a reason Jesus created a new covenant and said to disregard the old testament. But there's a lot of stuff that was added or removed from the new testament as well, again because of those priests that like little boys.When wondering whether I am duty bound to stone a divorced woman for being an adulterer per Yahweh or should instead let someone without sin cast the first stone, I see that the Bible is absolutely wrong in some areas, because it can't even agree with itself. More specifically, there are many different gods (Yahweh, Ba'al, Jesus, Molech) described within.

Funny how people in the conspiracy sub believe religious bullshit, when religion is literally the oldest conspiracy there is. Religion was created to control people through fear. The Bible is so logically inconsistent it's amazing anyone could believe it. 

Virtually everything bad about Christianity is from the old testament or pagan traditions. Christianity should be about Jesus Christ and loving each other. "Christians" who focus on hating gays and the poor are frauds.The neocons who pretend to be Christian and advanced all these concepts are Satanists.

I'm interested in your thoughts on the suppression of Christianity as well. And  if you see the elite tied to dark (imo this is the easy part), why/what *specifically* made you think Christianity itself was the light? Why not Buddhism or Islam?  I'm admittedly heavily biased against the machinations of all Abrahamic religions because of reasons similar to noservant but fascinating shit like this requires an open mind

This is a religious thread, there won't be a speck of physical evidence for anything being claimed.

This guy dabbles in it I believe. I watched it a while ago, should be talking about elite, satanic rituals, etc.  https://youtu.be/PGueIrB6htgEdit, forgot to add source 

I second that.My comprehension is that the moral laws had not changed, since God's nature is out of time/eternal. But the ritualistic laws are to be put in context and thus not applied to everyone /everywhere/anytime.

> The Mosaic law existed for a purpose, and created a Covenant people through whom Jesus and his pure bloodline is traced perfectly (God ensured he was not part of the serpent seed genetic line, since Jesus had to remain sinless, and perfectly pure and adhere to the Mosaic law 100% in order to fill the requirement of the LawCan you specify or expand on this? After the flood only Noah and his sons remained. Where or what is the serpent's seed?  Are there any books that you can recommend that will give context to the Bible? Especially for anyone starting out?

Don't spout your superstitions as facts. Jesus was never so close-minded. Sounds like you worship the yadabolath of the old testament. 

> Jesus is YahwehJesus is god the son. Yahweh is god the father. They are separate. They are both part of god the holy spirit.Yahweh said to stone adulterers. Jesus said he without sin should cast the first stone.

Why does a completely omnipotent being need a sacrifice?? He's literally supposed to be the creator of everything and all powerful but he needs all this pointless shit to happen to "save" us? Come on man. And you keep begging the question. When we're debating whether or not religion is legit, you can't use "divine law and structures" as an argument to support your view. Because that's literally the thing being debated. You're already presupposing the existence of all these religious ideas by using them as justification for shit not adding up. Logic doesn't work that way. 

> In other words, *you will simply be deleted and it will be as if you never existed*, and no one will remember you or your name (after the punishment in Hell for your crimes is fulfilled, that is. Hell is a TEMPORARY place that is a prison for spirits, think of it as a jail for criminals to serve their time in, only ramped up to x1000 and full of demonic spirits that ABSOLUTELY LOATHE AND HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT HUMANS. Soon Hell, along with Death will be done away with for all eternity.)This doesn't sound right. Judge yourself:>> Rev. 20:10>> ... cast into the lake of fire ... and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.  >> Rev. 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

I went to Catholic school for over a decade, and I am only posing questions about the teachings of my own religion. Don't assume what I do or don't take literally. I am questioning a dogma here. Do you have an answer or just a suggestion for my life? Peace

Agree. I have met the god-source. If the Archons are trying to stop that, they're doing a really shitty job.

So you're not a Trinitarian? A Trinitarian looks to the father. His will is my will.

Holy shit it's my cake day! And for sure, this sub and &/r/weedstocks is where I chill 

 

We choose to think of god as good, but god is everything, including evil. God is only good is generally wishful thinking. Look for gods that are good... Jesus is a good example.

Christian God the Father = Old Testament god = Yahweh = Demiurge = creator godChristians follow Jesus Christ (hence the name) but also recognize Yahweh and god the holy spirit (god-source, real god) as the trinity.

 

archons... are cons! lol. How can one free themselves of soul contracts? Are archons able to attack someone spiritually and torture them greatly?

Does it feel like removing attached beings...

I am trying to teach them the process of how to "Remove Soul Contracts". This is very difficult because of many reasons. First you have to get into the Astral Afterlife and be able to stay there for an extended period. The Archons have a very large number of actual deceased humans who eagerly work for them. These people have many roles from the numerous counselors (really mind programmers) to full fledged security and law enforcement types who are extremely close minded and violent towards those who do not fully go with the program. Many people have very vivid dreams of the large university type buildings that are all over the Astral Afterlife. These buildings are what David Icke calls the "Halls Of Programming'. I have been in many of them. The "Counselors" are constantly inside the lecture halls with the deceased targets. Constantly saturating their minds with the falsehood that the hardships they endured were part of the "lessons" and the earth is a "school". The targeted person is fed this propaganda non stop for many years. They are taught to distrust and report on living humans who cross over. People who are caught speaking with a living human are severely punished and made an example of.  The Archon Hierachy will do anything to keep both sides of humanity uninformed and to maintain this system of enslavement.

Because Satan, the fallen angels, and the most depraved of this world know they're going to the pool of fire for eternity and they don't want to be lonely, so they will make everyone follow their ways as much as possible so they can increase the numbers that will be going to hell. 

A combination of mostly Astral Projection, some Advanced Lucid Dreaming and the use of various rotating supplements. Galantamine with Choline and Melatonin, Magnesium, Wheat Grass Tablets, Kelp, Gotu Kola etc..  I have never used DMT. Although years ago I had a Salvia Divornum experience that seems very similar to what DMT users experience. I saw the colors, geometric shapes and machine elves. I feel this is a completely different experience that is not connected to the Archons or the Astral Afterlife.

Most likely DMT or past life regression hypnosis are the most common ways to meet beings on the other side. I say "beings" because they are not human.

I too, am curious about his methods. I feel it's impossible for me and I've tried many times. 

The Astral Afterlife looks just like here. Houses, bars and restaurants. Food tastes like food. people indulge in "romantic relations". The major difference is that objects can be moved by thought. Although it seems to be very illegal to do so in that dimension. The afterlife is in a martial law type of scenario. There is actually much less freedom throughout the afterlife than here. Deceased people attend regular seminars to discuss their previous life. (this is actually major programming and mind control) the deceased humans are strung along and made to feel bad about themselves. all of this being a set up by the humans who work for the archons. after many years of being fed complete propaganda the human is then Forced To Reincarnate.

Same!

So, you basically just agreed with me. All three stand under the same Abrahamic umbrella.

Jesus claims to be God, the Word.  No one else claims to be God.

Where in my comment do I compare Gnosticism and Islam?Nowhere...Please read my comment fully before replying. I merely am drawing a circle around the three religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) as all deriving from the Abrahamic tradition.Your comment as a seperate piece of dialogue is very intriguing, however. I agree that Islam would have found Gnosticism abhorrent; they currently do, anyways.

>early references to christ around his time mention him as an old manSource?

yeah that can be said too. I wouldnt refute that.

And humans the offspring.

A lot of original church teachings/concepts were just bastardized neo-platonic ideals crammed into Paul's ideology. 

well put, thank you!

Demi-gods, devils, angels. The Greeks call one Jupiter, the Romans call presumably the same entity Zeus, Jews call it Ba'al. All are presumably the same thing under different names to different peoples.

i think it's wrong to label them as evil? i mean the plane we are on experiences both contractive and expansive energies, whereas there are places/planets/other planes that are solely contractive or expansive. the positive will see the negative as evil and the negative will see the positive as evil, especially when forcefully imposed on the other. if that makes sense.without positive and negative energies i think there wouldn't be much balance, especially where we humans reside.i think why we might perceive certain entities or things as evil is because we go in with already preconceived notions of what is "scary/unsettling" so that feeling might warrant a response that is undesireable. not leaving room for acceptance of them. traversing those places needs us to be accepting without judgement so as to understand them better, i believe.

Well in most NDE accounts, the dying person is utterly at peace, without any fear, and feels an unequivocally loving presence.  If they are trusting themselves -- and most of them do -- then there is nothing to fear about walking *into* the light.  The perspective of astralrocker2001 is that the light is a trap, i.e. his version instills a great deal of fear in comparison to the typical account.  His version is at odds with the majority, and also much darker, and much more likely to sow fear and doubt.  That's why I'm asking.  I'm not utterly discounting it, but I'd like to know what he thinks the alternatives are.

> Why would something bad happen to a divine beingThe problem with being divine is that you're also infinite. The problem with being infinite is you have to be everything, both infinitely good and infinitely evil. 

I appreciate the link.  In reading it, it seems that Brian's interpretation is different from yours.  Although the "aliens" certainly seem to be non-human, his experience of them was that they were full of love and understanding.  And, in fact, he hints that the desperate humans at the beginning were "stuck":> So, now you are out of your body you may look down and see your body. You may take off for another room or zip back into your body. You may go into the void. This is the home of many a grim story. See, after death you may end up quite stuck in this void. It lacks one thing: love. It is the hell the Pope just figured out. It is not being of love, not recognizing it. Those who are stuck there may frighten you by just being or by intentional gestures to frighten you. They are stuck and they are confused and they will put the "HELL" in hell. My sense of NDEs is that most of the people who go through them experience a profoundly loving presence, and they are pretty certain of their experience and feelings.  If we can't trust them, if indeed they cannot even trust themselves, then what *can* we trust?  It seems like there is no capacity then for human discernment whatsoever, and that everything is ultimately pointless, even the experience of being human.  I don't believe that, so I have a hard time discounting what 99% of NDEs are telling us about the experience of death.

Why is loosh (pain and fear and evil) a food source? Why would a creature exist (have been created) to feed on something like that?I assume you think that if you resist the light after death, and don't reincarnate, you will be able to return to your true self, outside the matrix. That's what I mean by returning home.

Still nothing. No one really has a concrete answer that I've found. The online journals and "scholars" won't give you anything that's conclusive.

WTAF? I had no idea. Its Everywhere! That's what I love about this sub. I am regularly humbled by my lack of knowledge, and I love to learn.

Where do you get the bark mentioned?

Sasha was a wizard if ever there was one. I actually hadn't realized he had died until I went to look him up. 2014 it seems. 

I had very interesting experiences on LSD and shrooms. I definitely felt as though I was seeing reality transformed at one point, something sinister. And another time I felt as though I was seeing beyond reality... Does this makes sense to anyone?Edit: spelling and grammar

Thanks for the clarification. I guess part of my question is - is that recognition of truth you get from within something that is actually *inside of you*, properly yours? Or are you able to tune into something greater, through which you're able receive that feeling of truth? So the question you posed to me is the one I'm posing to you. Are the tools of recognizing truth inherently inside you and you have to just use them, or are they external to you and really are a fixed compass that you can rely on as not being transitory or changeable as you are?

Interesting. As a Christian, I believe Gnosticism IS Luciferianism. From what I know of occultism, the plot is that we are trapped in a reincarnation circle so the way to break free is to gain "gnosis" through spiritual practices that eventually lead to being in contact or posessed by demonic entities and damning your soul for eternity.I think it is one big lie that God expressly warned and forbid us from many many times in the scriptures.What is your take on this? 

Your beliefs make a lot of sense, but when I studied the bible I just wasn't a fan of being a servant to God for eternity (was reading revelations at the time). It felt boring, like what am I gonna do for eternity? Serve god wine and cheese or chill out with him whenever he wants lol. Not my exact thoughts but it demonstrates my opinion on that matter. Then I started getting heavily into Buddhism because I like the idea that a human individual can become enlightened without being directly dependent on God for everything. I like the Buddhist teachings about oneness and the idea that we all are a piece of the same source consciousness experiencing other pieces of ourselves in a way.Since we are all one, and all things are connected, compassion and good actions towards other living things and the universe as a whole is ultimately compassion for ourselves and a key way to overcome suffering brought on by the birth and death cycle of samsara.

Can you prove you have read all this stuff? I don't doubt you have but I thought I would say it before someone else inevitably does:) good points though

Slave or servant. Sounds like choosing between being a field slave or a house slave lol. But either way you are on the plantation. How do you know it was somthing outside of ourself that made you "better" and not just all of your traveling learning and maturing as a natural process. And I'm looking at human sacrifice as it was forshadowed by all of the animal sacrifices in the Old Testament. God provided the way because it was his fucking idea or he wouldn't have had all the laws statutes pertaining to animal sacrifice in the Old Testament. What is God is real and so is Jesus and they are both the same fucking guy or two guys father and son just fucking with you?

You seriously need to get some help bro. You most likely have schizophrenia, and it isn't safe for you to go around spreading this utter nonsense to kids. Please get to a therapist ASAP before you cause some real damage to young impressionable minds.

Interesting take. 

Isn't divide and conquer the game they have always used?

God-source encompasses everything. All good, all evil, both Jesus and the devil. All part of the infinite god-source. That's the problem. It's working on the solution.

You're right. I do think your story is bullshit. Because it's either bullshit or what you're telling me is that the cure for being blind, lame, sick, etc is in east Africa. And that to be healed one would have to attend an Evangelical Festival. Why not go door to door in your own fucking country and heal your own neighbors? Sounds much more like you went on vacation and circle jerked each other about how powerful your god is when he only heals people that come to him. Or even allows disease in the first place.  

how did you come to this viewpoint?

so it's this time.. anything interesting happening lol 

Good username.12/25 is the winter solstice, it's a pagan holiday. The book of Revelations says Jesus will be born during a certain celestial alignment, which astronomers have found occurred September 11, year 3. The same alignment will happen this year, September 23. It only happens every 500 years or so.https://goodnessofgodministries.wordpress.com/2011/12/22/when-was-jesus-christ-born-the-bible-says-september-11-3bc-the-day-of-the-feast-of-trumpets/

Jewish new year 9-11  Orthodox Christian new year 9-11  Description of the shepherds in the Bible indicates a time around 9-11So as far as I am able to ascertain it *might* be his birthday. But in the end that is of no importance to you or me. It make no difference to us. What we need to concentrate on is to worship our Lord and have love in our hearts especially for one another.  If I may, it's better to read the New Testament of the KJV than to waste once time finding out if 9-11 was indeed his birthday (but I obviously did so who am I to talk ;) ).

My name fits me. Your's does too, *occultowl*. Your allegiance is shown within it in fact.Your words are blatantly false, even blasphemous as you consider YHWH & Jesus to be the same as Ba'al and Molech.You don't even understand the story of Abraham, where Yahweh STOPPED the test of faith of Abram and PROVIDED a sacrificial ram instead. Jezebel is the most wicked woman in all of scripture, so of course she sacrificed for foreign God's. In fact that never stopped, still happens to this very day.You have no understanding of the difference between the two covenants, let alone the purpose of them. You are one lost soul brother. Why don't you get off reddit and reading doctrines from deceiving demons and actually pick up the Holy Word and read it for yourself? Quit relying on others to falsely explain it to you.

Look into Sikhism, it is essentially worship of the god-source that encompasses everything. That is what Christians worship when they worship god the holy spirit.

It is speculated that the corrupted genetic code came from Noah's sons wives.

Everything I posted comes from studying Scripture and is backed accordingly my friend, all of it. *Listen carefully*, if you claim that you believe in Jesus, but you do not acknowledge that He is the same God from the Old Testament (YHWH), and that Jesus, as "The Word" was with the Father since the beginning, that they are One and that the Father is in Him and He is in the Father, than you **DENY** JESUS AS LORD and are just as deceived by those that stalk this place as all the others.Jesus is Yahweh/YHWH/Jehovah. He authored both the Old AND New Testament. I prefer to use another translation which is "Covenants." The entirety of the Bible, is about the Messiah, the Christ. All the OT prophecies pointed to Him which He filled Perfectly, to the literal day of the Festivals. God's timing is exact and precise, nothing is chance, nothing is random.Instead of spewing around this filth of Yabadabbadooda that you are all so willing to claim as true Truth, when you know nothing of the Truth, why don't you spend time meditating on REAL Names of God so that you don't continue to blaspheme and profane His name out of ignorance!*Abba, Elohim, Yahweh, El Shaddai, Adonai, Emmanuel, Yeshua, Jesus.***Marantha Yeshua ha'Mashiach, Maranatha.**

[Did Jesus Really Claim to be God?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWDdy0k8WNA)Jesus is the great **I AM**

There is only one True God. We really can't quite understand this with our finite minds, but take a look at this if you want to know more:[Explaining the Trinity and Christ](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheArmorofGod/comments/6jiuum/explaining_the_trinity_and_christ/)

God is a God of order, structure, law, categorization, sequence, hierarchy, etc. **NOT** randomness or chaos like you propose.There is a divine law that was created which includes a penalty for **SIN**, which is **DEATH**. Blood is the currency it is paid in. In order to be with God Himself, there must be **NO SIN**, for none can be found in Him. So the penalty must be paid, for God adheres to His own law.The default option is to pay with **YOUR** blood. This is the option you have presently chosen and the path you are on currently.In the days of man since Adam up until Jesus Christ (the last, sinless, perfect atoning sacrifice, *God in the flesh*) the penalty was paid with innocent the blood and lives of innocent animals. Imagine for a moment what a stark and sobering reminder would be if you had to slit the throat of an innocent animal **FOR YOUR PERSONAL SINS**. Do you think that might help put it in perspective just how destructive sin is, and the wickedness that abounds in all us in this fallen world? The devil perverts and twists everything ordained by God. He has turned these into sacrifices of humans and infants to appease *him*, the Father of lies, through the millions of false deities that exist throughout the world and passed down their ancient pagan civilizations. There's nothing new under the sun.We live in a time where we have the glorious and merciful option to have our personal sins atoned for by the ***Faith in Christ Jesus***, and what His sacrifice and sub-sequent bodily resurrection has done and the new door that is now  open. This is a **FREE GIFT** of Salvation, that cannot by earned by any amount of 'good works'. You cannot 'buy' it. It is a gift of mercy from the God that created you personally, and everything you see before you. All things seen and unseen. I pray that you will find this truth before you are snuffed out for all eternity during the coming 7 year tribulation period that begins soon.

Take special note of the **bold** in Scripture below.Everything must always be read in context, this is a fundamental necessity to understanding the Bible and what God is conveying to us in a particular chapter or verse. Every Word is specifically chosen, including the *absence* of words, as is in this particular case. Sometimes the smallest details play an integral role. ---First let's rewind one chapter back to 19...> **( Revelation 19:19-20 )** "And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army. And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. **These two** were thrown alive into the lake of fire that **burns with sulfur**."The context of this is the Battle of Armageddon at the end of the 7 year tribulation at the Second Coming of Christ along with the Host of Heaven (and saints, if you choose...) All the armies of the world that gather there are destroyed. 2 of the 3 main players during the Tribulation are cast into the lake of fire that **BURNS WITH SULFUR** *(note this)*---Now in Chapter 20, the scene is all about Satan and his imprisonment at the end of the tribulation period during the millennial reign of Christ on earth where peace will be restored for a literal 1000 years after the judgements of the tribulation period have been completed. Verses 1-6 cover these events in detail. Starting at verse 7, we fast forward to the end of the 1000 year period, where satan is released one last and final time for the *second* Gog & Magog battle where it is finally finished, and satan's end is finally reached, before the *New* Heavens & Earth are created (all sin will be purged in both realms permanently, eternally)> **( Revelation 20:7-10 )** "And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them, and the **devil** who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire **and sulfur** where the **beast** and the **false prophet were**, and **they** will be tormented day and night forever and ever."Verses 7-10 are all personally about satan (as is the context of the entire chapter). Note it specifically mentions the sulfur again, in ADDITION to the lake of fire. The Beast and False Prophet are ALREADY THERE because they were cast into it as covered above. The very last part of this I believe causes a great deal of confusion, as it reads: "will be tormented day and night forever and ever." Again, in context. WHO is there? (1) **Satan** (2) **The Beast**[anti-Christ] (3) **False Prophet** *[if i were to disclose my true opinion I would offend a great many roman catholics...]*Satan was formerly Lucifer, a beautiful angelic creature that was created as an immortal spirit, as all angels were. Their heavenly mutiny was a far more grievous sin than ours since they had been in the presence of Almighty. Their power and knowledge is unfathomable to us. They were created to live forever, therefore their punishment is equal to their sin. Since they were created to be eternal, they will be in torment eternally.---The scene below is the resurrection of the unbelieving dead for judgement. Everything is replayed for them perfectly, every moment, every thought, everything. Note the locations where the dead are raised from are listed separately ... The Sea, Death & Hades(hell). Different abodes of the dead, which is a topic for another day.> **( Revelation 20:11-15 )** "Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. **And I saw the dead**, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the **dead were judged** by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the **sea** gave up the dead who were in it, **Death** and **Hades** gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. **Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire**. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, **he was thrown into the lake of fire**."At the end, the 'second death' is being cast into the lake of fire. However this time there is **NO** mention of burning sulfur!! There is a separate judgement that awaits mortal humanity, whom was **NOT** created immortal originally, and is conditional upon receiving the fruit from the Tree of Life.Note that both Death & Hades are **ALSO** thrown into the lake of fire. Death will be no more. Hell will be no more. Those whose names are not found written in the Book of Life that did not accept the testimony of God about Himself as Jesus Christ redeeming our temporary fallen world that exists under the shadow of darkness, will be no more.There are other scriptures in other books that reference an "eternal punishment" which seems to often be added to the "will be tormented day and night forever and ever." judgement for satan and his minions, and assumed to be talking about humanity. Separation from God **IS ETERNAL PUNISHMENT**. For nothing can exist outside of God, since He created everything and we all exist in Him. Without the light, there is only darkness. Without the heat, there is only cold. Without God, there is nothing. Nada. Eternal separation because you and your soul will be absolutely eradicated in the lake of fire, for all eternity. There is no reincarnation, there are no second chances.---Not enough?I understand. I had to search for more too. Since we were in Revelation, the last book, let's go back to the beginning at creation in Genesis> **( Genesis 3:22-24 )** "Then the Lord God said, ‚ÄúBehold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. **Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever‚Äî‚Äù therefore the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden** to work the ground from which he was taken. He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to **guard the way to the tree of life."**Notice the addendum at the end "lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever". Note the Cherubim placed there to ensure they couldn't regain entrance. God knows all, He created the phenomenon we call "time". He is outside of it, before it. The alpha, the omega, the beginning and the end. Since he knows all, sees all, and is all, and has complete fore-knowledge, knowing that our weak flesh would succumb and ignore the one and only command he originally gave Adam & Eve.Although this may be hard to accept, but kicking us **OUT** of the garden was actually showing us **MERCY**. For if we were allowed to stay in our present fallen sinful state, AND gain access to the tree, than we would **LIVE FOREVER** CURSED IN SIN. We are not like the angels, who were created as immortal spirits. We are flesh, blood. We are His precious children, that spit in His face and deny everything good and holy.---Lastly, as you study His Word and you learn first-hand of God's sovereign power and about his character you will start to develop an understanding of what He is like. Full of incredibly deep emotions we can't begin to fathom. He is a poet, a songwriter, a warrior, a king, and so much more. You will learn of His core attributes, such as Love & Mercy. Knowing this, it is **not in His character** if all the lost souls in this heavily deceived and demonically controlled world would be damned to an eternal torment in perpetual agony for all of eternity for choosing to deny God as Jesus Christ, thus forfeiting unimaginable rewards and inheritance of everything for all of eternity. It is far more **merciful** to absolutely eradicate all trace of them instead.His ways are not our ways, it is difficult for us to understand. Our vision is so small, we know so little. He knows everything about everywhere of all time. Trust in Him, and He will not lead you astray.EDIT: roman* catholic

Historically it goes deeper.  The Catholic Church then attempted to stamp out this gnostic truth, destroying or hiding the evidence, twisting scripture.  To this day I wonder if that is the 'ultimate' secret they hide in their catacombs.  Allegro found the older Dead Sea Scrolls and was ostracized for his interpretation.  FFWD to modern day, and mushrooms are illegal worldwide, a ban imposed by the United Nations.  A simple lifeform that grows freely around the Earth is illegal.  Depriving humanity of the mushroom/psychedelic keeps many in a sleepful, unwakened state.  Not everyone needs the mushroom/psychedelic to awaken but a lot do, and a lot won't without it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xfe7g-3XukSee the book: mushrooms and mankindAlso the reason mushrooms are the key is because our evolutionary ancestors long ago utilized them to punctuate the natural selection process and increase our creative intelligence.

Yes but we believe Jesus is the correct teaching and what God was always trying to convey love You enemy and treat your neighbor as yourself.

Jesus and Yahweh were both created by god the holy spirit, the god-source. Jesus is good. Yahweh is, like most people, a mix. He even called himself a jealous god in the 10 commandments.

Cameron Day has the best information on how to Remove Soul Contracts.

 

it is very similar

>The Archon Hierachy will do anything to keep both sides of humanity uninformed and to maintain this system of enslavement.factthat many are reading this shows the control is weakening. What can we do to weaken it further, particularly on an individual basis? 

Thank you so much for replying. This is absolutely terrifying but I needed to know about it and I'm very eager to learn more. I will be spending a lot of time combing through your posts again this evening.Thank you for sharing everything you know with us on here!

I thought once you die you get reincarnated. How do people end up in Astral after life if that make sense? 

And God allows this? Why do you think that is?

What do you mean with "the machine levels"?

You trust hypnotists??*shudders*They could turn you to stone if they chose. 

I guess none of us are really "human" 

What are the beings?  I had a long dissociative phase with MXE and DXM.  It was pretty dark though a lot of times.  It's like it enjoyed tricking me to believe crazy things.

I utilize past-life regression. Find someone trained in Shamanic practices or of the Dolores Cannon method.

That's why you will never break through. If you believe something is impossible than it is, at least for you. 

And what's your personal vision of the way to break this circle?

> So, you basically just agreed with meNo I didnt.>All three stand under the same Abrahamic umbrella.Only at the more external and popular level. But at their core beliefs they are very different. My conclusion is that they cannot be all true at the same time.. or they are talking about different beings..

Upon death the human is scanned. The images of deceased loves ones waving you into the light and the feeling of "incredible love" are actually taken from the dying person and reflected and significantly amplified back by the tech of the Archons. NDE has been their greatest tool of deception and the worst thing to happen to humanity. It has been incredibly successful advertising to get an already gullible and completely uniformed populus to embrace and walk right into the "White Light Trap":https://wakeup-world.com/2015/09/23/death-and-the-tunnel-of-light-the-final-grand-trick/

Who says?

"My sense of NDEs is that most of the people who go through them experience a profoundly loving presence, and they are pretty certain of their experience and feelings."This isn't actually true. There was a giant metastudy on NDE's a few years back (real academic work) - I'm off to work at the moment but will try to find the link again when I get back.In a nutshell, it found the loving, peaceful, and white-light tropes were stastically common ONLY in Western cultures (those influenced mainly by Christianity, even if those who experience it were not expressly Christian themselves). Far more common in all of Asia and India was the "bureaucratic" NDE experience - those people claimed to experience being lead into a boring "governmental" office of some kind, where boring workers claimed "problems with their paperwork" lead them there and that they should be sent back. (The "paperwork" trope in particular is incredibly common). Most did not report feelings of peace, bliss, etc. to go along with this.And, of course, NDE's themselves are entirely unpredictable, and the vast majority of those who clinically die and then are resuscitated experience nothing memorable at all in that time.What all this shows us, I have no idea - just pointing out that looking to NDE's and other experiences as somehow pointing to some kind of truth about the nature of the universe is probably not worthwhile.

>  then what can we trust? We can trust the people that claim the light is a trap. /sSeriously, I too have been wondering where those people get their knowledge from. 

Short answer here...mankind is governed by natural law.  We are animals! When mankind doesn't abide by nature, the Archons become active.  When you break the wrong laws, they will take your past and experience and twist your reality...think of them like federal prosecutors.  Don't they have a happen of pushing for the maximum sentences? It's up to the lawyer for the defense to whittle down a plea or win the case.  You can "beat" the Archons by eliminating negativity, pure and simple, but that is a tall order for MANY out there, and there are many paths for doing so.  The interesting thing about reality is that there ISN'T one path for defeating the darkness, so to speak.  Because it is intimately personal to everyone.  Negativity is NATURAL, and that is the tough part.  Understanding why we have negative feelings in the first place is the key to understanding ourselves, and defeat evil, really.  Internal alchemy will always be the truest way to salvation.PM me if you want more info, but I can be rather dense at times (pun intended)  :)

I saw him speak once...outrageous amounts of energy and charisma!

it makes sense to me, but how do we know that experience is real and not just a bunch of chemical reactions in our brain?

> Or are you able to tune into something greater, through which you're able receive that feeling of truth?That one!And that is done by looking within. I'm not really trying to get into a complex game of semantics, what of these abstract things is yours and not yours. Too confusing. Feeling the compass and learning to follow it is surely enough?Have a great day my friend!

One hundred percent in agreement with you. I have family members involved in the occult. I have participated in exorcisms. Demons and spirits are real. Only thing that seems to have REAL power/hold over them is the name of Jesus. 

At the end of the day I'm going more with the Jedi metaphor. There is a light and dark side, we all have an incorruptible soul that belongs to you and you alone. Pretty sure no matter what your belief system (christian, buddhist or otherwise) you should never allow or encourage any entity, spirit, demon or whatever to inhabit your body.To "break free" possibly means to remove anything that isn't the true authentic soul self. Remove your ego, your race, your nationality, your desires, lust etc. Dissolve away anything and everything you thought was "you" until that inalienable, indestructible, eternal nugget at the center of your soul shines clean and bright like a diamond  or star... something like that.As far as these demons and archons go, I guess the idea is not to be fooled by idols, and false gods. For example the "architect" in the matrix for all intents and purposes designed and created the entire world that neo lives in. Yet even with all that power, there are still constraint and limits on what he can and can't do. Therefore the arch is NOT God. Because God by definition has limitless power, knowledge, presence etc.tl;drDon't worship any entities, in fact anytime someone tries to flex and scare / manipulate you into thinking they are a   God (or claim can make you god) they're probably not.

>Can you prove you have read all this stuff?I mean, if we were in person and talked you'd be able to tell I know what I'm talking about and I could show you my collection of theology/religion books. But otherwise me telling you that "Gnosis" is an excellent book that covers the differing varieties of gnostic history and gnosticism (there were christian flavors, zoroastrian, various greek/egyptian philosophy types) is worth reading, and telling you that the gnosticism frequently discussed in conspiracy forums pick and choose which types of texts to consider legit. I could tell you that some communities had compelling texts, but their communities were so out of place with Roman society at the time that they invited persecution, I could tell you how some forbid sex, some were suicide cults, others were run-of-the-mill cults, some did weird shit with kids, some had mandated orgies, some were just society-drop out hippie communes, I could tell you that the gospel of judas is interesting to read but at the same time literally useless in regards to personal application, I could tell you of my personal suspicion that the gospel of John was absolutely influenced by gnostic thought....but for all you know I looked that stuff up on wikipedia! Gnostic ideas are interesting! But I'm ultimately I'm not convinced because gnostics believed that the way to being saved (i.e. you're spirit bypassing the archons and demiurge to rejoin the pleuroma--the original God-being) involved knowing "secret knowledge" ("gnosis"). So what would happen in Roman times is that there would be a guy (let's say "Tim) who would claim to have received "secret passwords/codes" orally, by word-of-mouth, from some agent of the pleroma (in christian gnostic communities, Jesus is one such agent), and the gnostic texts were proof. So Tim would say, "I met a wise man who shared with me the secret codes he learned from Jesus. These secret codes will help us reach the pleroma after we die. Also, we need to wear these special necklaces. You should read 'The gospel of thomas' as proof that my explanation of reality is true. Also, you should live with us, work with/for us and give us all your possessions--oh and the secret knowledge can only be shared via sexual intercourse so we ALL have to have sex a lot, all the time." Gnostic communities were sometimes extremely ethical and strict, but from my own studies they don't sound nice, healthy or or sustainable.The problem is we do not have access to those "secrete knowledges"/secret passwords. The gnostic texts/gospels speak of them existing, but they don't say what they are. Just being aware of the gnostic worldview is not sufficient to being "saved" or returning to the original God/monad.So yeah, when you read gnostic history and you see how messy it was and how blatantly self-serving people were, to me that is not good proof that this is an accurate reflection of the spiritual world. Spiritual truth about a spiritual reality, in my mind, is evident when it brings about physical truth in my physical reality. Physical truth as in harmony, peace and life abundance. I do not see gnosticism as creating better people or helping me in any sort of concrete way here today, in the real world.

Wonder why you deleted your comment. If the god of the Bible didn't plan a human sacrifice from the beginning then why does his name YHWH in paleo Hebrew pictogram mean behold the nail behold the arm. Which to me seems to point to his plan of salvation aka human sacrifice from the very beginning. You see it's easy to have the solution when you create the problem in the first place. We are not seperate from the creator of everything. We never were. We are not sinners. I don't have to live my life for anyone's will but my own. My creator made me to be free not to be Her servant or slave.  

 

Posted elsewhere in this thread, but here's the expanded version:Suppose you're an infinite being. The problem with being an infinite being is that you have to be infinitely evil in addition to being infinitely good.So you want to find out how to stop being evil, and then you want to do whatever that is. The way to discover the solution is to setup a series of experiments, and the way to implement the solution is to setup an iterative process and run through it over and over.So you create an infinite universe, and then create an infinite number of these universes to make a multiverse. Then you run the experiment to find out what to do with evil.Ultimately, you come to the unfortunate conclusion that you're infinite, and you can't get rid of evil because that would require you to be finite. However, good news, you can quarantine evil.So you create a soul soup, think of it like an infinite bowl of mud, good water mixed with evil dirt. This soup is you. You create stars and worlds and people, and when each person is born, you pour some of the soul soup into them, creating them out of a part of you.So as part of this experiment, you now start an iterative process to identify, separate, and quarantine evil. You create karmic vacuum cleaners to gobble up and store all the evil dirt. When each person dies, you separate the dirt from the water. The water goes back in the bowl, the dirt in the vacuum cleaner. As you iterate this process, the soul soup gets increasingly clearer and the vacuum fills up. Iterate this for all of time, and mission accomplished. Fortunately, time is something you constructed, so this actually happens instantly for you.Now some people figured this out, and they put some names to it. The infinite being is god, the karmic vacuum cleaners are the devil(s) or archons, the soul soup is heaven, and the quarantine is hell. Different people have different names, but it's the same idea.We are all part of a larger whole that encompasses all matter, energy, and thought. We are running a simulation, a combination experiment and iterative process to solve the problem of evil. Our role is to materialize good and evil so it can be identified and separated. Our job is already done, but we don't know it yet. At some point we will be finished, and we will all come back to one.

1) here is the info you need:http://www.ascensionhelp.com/blog/2013/08/23/why-i-am-no-longer-a-light-worker/

Well your entitled to your own opinion. I know what I seen though

I had older relatives who were really into the arcane and esoteric. At age 5, I began reading every book and magazine they had literally non stop. Decades later after reading thousands of books, magazines, articles and watching videos and listening to all kinds of recordings and live broadcasts, I began experimenting with different kinds of Astral Projection and Advanced Lucid Dreaming. At this point I was actually visiting with and conversing with deceased humans in the Astral Afterlife. There are people all over the world doing the same...

Hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, solar flares... Lots of shit. Whether you chalk it up to normal weather patterns or relate it to theories being discussed in this thread is for you to decide.

I think it happens even less often that that. Ive checked Stellarium and I cant find the exact alignment happen at any time other than 9/23/17. 9/11/3 isnt even an exact match.What do you personally think is coming in the next few months?

Very true friend. It really doesnt matter. I just finished Matthew in the New Testament, Im reading the Bible for the first time. Jesus made the ultimate sacrifice and it makes me want to cry just thinking about it. I really hope I get to meet him one day.Thank you for the reply and God bless!

Yeah, my name is not a great example, I'm aware. Let's say I like the owl as a symbol of knowledge and truth, not the one they worship at Bohemian Grove.I don't consider Yahweh to be Molech and that's not what I said. I definitely don't consider Jesus to be Molech, they are antithetical.

The devils that Jezebel worshiped are the same devils the pope worships. The sculpture of Jesus in a nuclear explosion in the papal auditorium and factthat high level priests keep getting caught fucking kids and covering it up should tell you that. And those priests are the people who edited the bible, decided what was in and out.I am 100% pro-Jesus, make no mistake. I'm anti-kid fucking priests and the parts of the bible that push hate against women, gays, etc. because Jesus is love, not hate.

I didn't say anything was "truth". I posed a question. A question that apparently angered the demon inside you. P.S. Jesus didn't author anything. He walked, and ministered. Men wrote his stories. Peace out demon.

So god demanded innocent blood to pay for "sin" that he created in the first place? And you worship such a twisted being??? I mean I really can't believe some of the shit people like you spout. Why the hell would god not just snap his fingers and fix the problem? He's omnipotent right?Why create all this ridiculousness and actually punish the people you created for not believing this bs? Can you answer any of these questions without preaching? Using a logical argument? Or is logic just the work of the devil too? I'm assuming that's what you mean when you say "the devil twists and perverts" things. That's the automatic answer from all you religious extremists. Because you can't actually answer in a satisfactory, logical manner. > I pray that you will find this truth before you are snuffed out for all eternity during the coming 7 year tribulation period that begins soon.Just stop for 1 second and think about what you're saying here.What kind of being would snuff out his own creation because we used the "free will" he supposedly gave us? If you think nothing is wrong with that, something's wrong with you. 

Again, what you are writing doesn't sound right ;)  > Rev. 21:07 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God and he shall be my son. 08 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongerers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and **all liars, shall have their part in *the lake which burneth with fire and brimestone*:** which is the second death.  So even if you try to differentiate between "lake of fire" and "lake of fire and brimstone" (which probably has merit) there are still people send to that eternal hell.

Its not difficult to understand. Basic logical deduction tells us that the Judeo-Christian god cannot possibly exist as described. Also, I can see based off how much you keep quoting Revelation that your pastor/priest went straight to that book to scare you into believing. My pastor did the same thing when I was a Christian. They *always* focus on Revelation, because that's the book that scares everyone so much that they believe simply out of fear for eternal punishment (wow what a nice god, eternal torture for exercising your free will. But he loves everyone! Makes perfect sense.)

Another great explanation.  Thank you.  For years I've had a worry I wanted to run past you.  Corruption of His written word.  You trust the Bible foundationally, and I need to be there.  Here are my thoughts and worries.1.  Translation issues.  Where you point out nuances based on what words were used or not used, do you ever fear things lost in the translation?  Or do you assume His hand guided the translators?2. Evil steering.  As a kid, I always wondered having grown up Catholic, wouldn't the Bible have been a great way to control the masses?  Romans got their mitts into it, British got their mitts into it, who knows what other groups working behind the scenes.  It would likely bring Satan much joy to have perverted His bible in addition to the Catholic Church, I think you would agree.  As the Bible has been edited (Enoch removed?) and it seems TPTB don't like us to have access to what they know - why would they allow us to have access to this?

So I take your believe in annihilation of the human's spirits as the SDAs and JWs ?

Yeah, it's basically Jesus first. Or at least should be.

You do absolutely fantastic work. Your ongoing posting of your research is helping people worldwide. At the end of the day everything points to the Archons. The "Soul Contracts" that they are using is what ultimately continues this horrific enslavement. Considering that most people, including many researchers have no idea who the Archons are, we really need to keep the knowledge of the Archons and what these "Soul Contracts" are flowing to the public. Everyone deserves to be saved from this enslavement. This incredible sub is what is going to turn the tide...

I would also recommend everyone really learns how to "Visualize". It needs to be the most important hobby anyone can do. The Matrix projects most of reality, but the time will come when people will have to create a "projected overlay" and effectively change scenarios. I practice this all the time and now at the point were the "hypnagogic imagery" that I am seeing in bed is beyond description. This book by the late Jose Silva is very low cost and mostly forgotten. It explains how to project on the "inner screen" of the mind. http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/184955.The_Silva_Mind_Control_Method

Thank you for being open minded and having the courage to embrace change. Together we will awaken humanity and create limitless worlds of infinite expansion  :)

Time works differently. Seems simple here for us, but from Buddhist/occultist perspective time is a construct of this reality.

Forced Reincarnation comes after a period of years in the Astral Afterlife.

To teach everyone to be holy and to be prepared to have the set-apart spirit. He lets evil rule this world so people can always have a chance to turn back and help his people. He is always testing to see if we are worthy of the kingdom after he cleanses all that does not belong. And he does this to see who really loves him and his people. His people are the blacks that were taken away to slavery away from Africa and all those who love him and profess their love for him. I'm pretty sure we are in revelations now and the next stage or chapter will occur within 20 years. All the previous doomsday talk has been in preparation for what's to come very soon. Do you think Obama will take back power forcefully and have everyone take the chip in their hand sometime soon?

the "machine elves" are small strange, trippy, cartoon like characters.

No I don't trust hypnotists either. DMT is a natural chemical in the body that is released when you sleep. However, if you don't sleep for a long time the DMT will build up in the body and can bring on an out of body experience. The key is to stay awake until you pass out which will trick the soul into thinking the body has died. Then you can leave your body and enter the spirit realm. This I have done many times. It does work. 

Can't everyone undo their own programming? 

They must have a PhD in Clinical Psychology to practice, at least that is the law in most US States.

The three all follow after the Abrahamic tradition. I agree with what you a describing, but I think we conceptually differ regarding the 'core' beliefs. You are looking at the fine details, while I am looking at the broad mythos of the Abrahamic tradition. I agree with you on the details bit, but I am not referring to that; might just be a semantic issue on my part.

They are considered the three "Abrahamic religions," I mean, it's kind of hard to say Rhode Island isn't a state, just because it's so much tinier than the other ones.

Not all Christians believe in the trinity, although a great majority do, and the Quran addresses these people specifically on numerous occasions.Chapter 5, "The Table Spread": verse 73https://quran.com/5/73"They have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the third of three.' And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment."The Quran also says in many places that the Quran was sent down to confirm what was previously given to mankind in the Torah and in the Gospel, but, because people changed those texts, the Quran has been sent down to state the message for the last time in the Arabic language so that it will not be changed in the way the Jews and Roman Pagans changed the texts for their own agendas.Chapter 10, "Yunus (Jonah)", verse 94https://quran.com/10/94"So if you (O Muhammad) are in doubt concerning that which We have revealed unto you, [i.e. that your name is written in the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] then ask those who are reading the Book [the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] before you. Verily, the truth has come to you from your Lord. So be not of those who doubt (it)."Chapter 4, "The Women": verse 47https://quran.com/4/47"O you who were given the Scripture, believe in what We have sent down [to Muhammad], confirming that which is with you, before We obliterate faces and turn them toward their backs or curse them as We cursed the sabbath-breakers. And ever is the decree of Allah accomplished."Chapter 4, "The Women", verses 51-52https://quran.com/4/51-52"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture, who believe in superstition and false objects of worship and say about the disbelievers, 'These are better guided than the believers as to the way'?"Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed; and he whom Allah curses - never will you find for him a helper."Chapter 5, "The Table Spread": verses 46-48https://quran.com/5/46-48"And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous."And let the People of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient."And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ."There are many more examples. I greatly encourage everyone to read the Quran in its entirety and then decide for themselves whether they believe in it or not. As a former Agnostic, reading it with an open mind led me to accept Islam as my faith. I never knew what it actually said until I read it myself, and it is truly profound and convincing.

As far as I can see they differ in that they each represent the "perfection" of the one before. That is, Jesus came to "perfect"/reform/expand the Mosaic code, whilst Mohammed came to "perfect"/reform/expand Christianity.So, they all share the same root (which is in fact traceable back to Babylon) but then take the revelation further.

All I want to know is how to find my wife after we go.

Take some responsibility for yourself , present and future. Look at what kind of ideas your forfeiting yourself to. Buddhism , especially Tibetan Mahayana , has studied reincarnation extensively for centuries. If your interested in a alternate pov start there. I accept that we are preyed upon and place the blame squarely on us. When we are done playing victim we can end this game instantly. Like a titan shaking off its slumber. 

From your link: > We are recycled over and over until we break free.What does it mean to "break free"?> So what is one supposed to do upon death? Well, I can‚Äôt say with any certainty. I wouldn‚Äôt go toward any tunnels or lights. And if angels and loved ones came, I would politely thank them for the invitation, but decline. The only light that you should be interested in is the light shining from your innermost soul. Follow that light, the light of your own Self, deep within. I‚Äôm sure you will find your destination.To me, this feels like a cop-out.  Also, while I agree in principle with the idea of following the light of your own "Self, deep within", that light ultimately emanates from the Ultimate Source (God if you will), so "freedom" should entail some kind of "closer" experience with the Source, or at least *something*.  I have trouble with the idea of avoiding the Light if nobody can tell me what the alternative looks like.Again, I don't mean to be confrontational.  It's just that it is a really important issue and I think we really do need to talk about what *else* exists other than the Light, if the Light is in fact False.  If you are presenting the Light as False, then we need to know what is True in order to achieve true and valid discernment.

Most ND experiencers actually say they were *pulled* towards the light, and they couldn't stop it. They didn't walk voluntarily towards it. Good luck walking away from it. 

Do you have a working model for how something can be infinite but also finite (not be everything)?

I died of anaphylaxis 23 yrs ago. Before I was resuscitated I followed the light tunnel. It was lovely. Since then I have had amazing experiences. It shaped my life. In a trance state I have had visions of what Gnostic beliefs gave names too .  The greatest fable being that someone died for our sins. Therefore, relieving us of personal responsibility. The more we think we are Saved no matter what, then the less we care about the bad we have done.  This plane of reality is our prison. Whether we wronged the creator or somehow chose this experience, Im not sure. Someone once told me that when the 3rd of the heavenly host rebeled against god they were cast down to earth. If that is so, we are the descendants of the fallen.  We live, die, live, die... until one day we have finally paid for our wrongdoings. I can remember peices of many different lives. I have married my wife a hundred times. My soul has split into other beings after death. There is no limit to how much we can split our energy. Most of us never realize what we are capable of, so we never leave this prison because we cannot remember the last time. Our negativity piles up and we return to correct it.  The veil blinds us to our personal truth. We can break the veil. Meditative trance, LSD, mushrooms, Heavy cannabis cocentrate. These all have consequences and benefits. DMT has always eluded me. Been looking for years but it hasn't happened yet. Just remember, We are pure light energy.Energy is eternal from one state to the next. DNA is somehow, simultaneously our physical reflexion of that energy and a physical cage. Be kind and good.  The shadow ones hate your goodness. Do not acknowledge them. Do not call to them. They will attach to you and hinder you throughout time. If you ignore them, they become bored and they move along. All of this because I died at the age of 19 for 1.5 minutes.  

Did you ever find that link? I am interested

You're a lucky man. 

Just a feeling I suppose. I have the distinct recollection of being inside of my mind and touching something other than myself. Something vast... Never spoken of it before.

Isn't all reality just a bunch of "chemical reactions in the brain" if you really think about it.

One could imply the other.

Thank you for your re-assurance. I've never experienced any of this personally, but I've been drawn to it for years.I only recently reached this conclusion after many breakthroughs in my knowledge. All of these occult systems have the same motif behind them, the original Luciferian lie: "ye shall be as Gods".All of them more or less point to the same path of opening your body and spirit to demonic contact if not possession. Of calling on these spirit forces to complete your 'Great Work'. What fools...If you don't mind, could you share your experience with the occult and what drove you towards Jesus Christ? It would help me a lot to know more about another Christian's experience on this topic.

Thank you for that. I shall look into this further. My comment about what proof do you have was tongue in cheek as you seemed to know your stuff ;)

I've been researching all this for a couple of weeks. I'm interested in getting deep into this and learning all I can. How can I start learning some of this myself? Where does the path you've traveled begin? Do you recommend any books?

Just say no to slavery!

> God doesn't expect animal sacrifices until humans establish it as a traditional way of pleasing God with a gift of their labor. Some gods do. Jesus doesn't. I'll take Jesus over Yahweh or whatever told Abram to kill his son.

I got news for you. If you take the set of all natural numbers and then eliminate the odd numbers, the set is still infinite :)Eliminating half of an infinite set doesn't make it finite. I think you don't understand what infinity means.

Cool story. 

cool. i dont doubt any of that, just in my own experience, i've found myself encountering various "supernatural" entities/forces, and finding them to be reflections of myself, with the "final answer" to all this being that i was, in a sense, the creator, and that all that seemed to be holding me back was just something inside of me

soooo what's after this ? After all the hurricanes earthquakes ect

I've seen conflicting analysis, depending on how close an alignment you're looking for, but it's definitely very rare.I'm not sure if Revelations is a prophecy, but I know some very powerful people are using it as a playbook.

Awesome to hear brother! You will definitely will want to read the gospel of John as well early on. To understand the very beginning verses of it substitute "the Word" with "Jesus" as you read it and you will *see* one of the meanings that is being said. =O)May Yeshua bless you in your spiritual growth & maturity as we all continue to gain understanding and interpret His Living Word that was graciously given to us during these last days and times.

Check out the very upper right corner of a $1 bill (may need magnifying glass) and you will find an owl there too. It is one of many symbols the occult have used for a long time, whether that's the intended meaning or not.> More specifically, there are many different gods (Yahweh, Ba'al, Jesus, Molech) described within.Although you did not explicity say that Jesus is the same as Molech, it is *implied* through that statement when you associate those 4 names together as all being "god's". You are implying that there is no hierarchy between them, and they are all in equal standing with one another. This is false.There is ONE True Living God, whom created ALL THINGS, including the eternal immortal spirits (angels) of which 1/3 of them fell, and followed the mutiny and deceit of Lucifer. Molech and Ba'al are just two of many many many false idols intended to steal the legitimate worship from God, for that is what the devil craved the most. He wanted to BE GOD, he wanted to be worshipped as God. So he counterfeits it here on earth, with the little time that he has.There is structure, order and a hierarchy. There is nothing above, or equal to the True God. He Himself is the creator of all the fallen 'gods' that (due to angels being granted free will, the same as us) chose to reject Him.Jesus is God *in the flesh*, and He claimed to be the great "I AM", as He rightfully is. In fact, this claim is the **ENTIRE REASON** that the Jewish leaders of the day (mostly pharisees) hated him so much. They did not recognize him and were ignorant to the prophecies of His coming (just like today). His claim as the Son of God, is the very thing that he was crucified for (which was intended all along), as His death and resurrection is the single act that defeated both the devil, and death itself.

> The devils that Jezebel worshiped are the same devils the pope worships.I agree.> The sculpture of Jesus in a nuclear explosion in the papal auditoriumAlso agree, the Paul VI Audience Hall is built so that you appear to literally be inside the head of a snake, complete with eyes, fangs, and that blasphemous abomination of a sculpture - http://imgur.com/r/conspiracy/HlZf3Kid diddling goes hand-in-hand with satanists, and a whole lot more too, that's just the tip of the sick demonic iceberg. I take comfort in verses like **Luke 17:1-3** where it says: "Jesus said to his disciples: ‚ÄúThings that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come. **It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble**. So watch yourselves."All will be revealed, every hidden sin done in secret dark places. All will be exposed, and there will be divine justice at the end of this age. The kid diddlers are gonna BUUURRRN, they have no idea what's coming their way, and they most definetly do not worship Jesus.If you are wondering why there is much corruption and pedophilia in the Roman Catholic church, it's because they are NOT the true church like they claim to be. In fact they have more in common with a full blown cult like Jehovah's Witness or Mormons than they do with a True God-Fearing Biblical Christian. This false Jesuit pope they thrust into office now is most likely going to play a very large role in the coming tribulation period. I do not support or condone anything in the catholic church, nor do I even consider them a valid denomination of Christianity. They are very, very deceived, and there's so much evidence for it I don't understand how any true believer that claims to be Catholic can't see the corruption within.Sidenote: Rome is *spiritual* Babylon. Read **Rev. 17-18** if you want to know the role it will play and it's eventual destruction. Substiture the word "babylon" with "rome" and it will make more sense when you read it.> the parts of the bible that push hate against women, gays, etc. because Jesus is love, not hate.Women being treated as inferior is from those that do not understand what the Word says. Even back in Genesis, when Eve was formed from the rib of Adam, this is symbolic of where a woman's place is in relationship to her husband. BY HIS SIDE. Not above him or in front of him, and not beneath him or behind him. By his side, as it was intended.Jesus (God) does **not** HATE homosexuals or lesbians. He loves the person, but He does indeed HATE THE SIN. Men lying with men is a particular grievous offense and considered "an abomination". Women lying with women is "unnatural". When a society completely embraces this lifestyle, like we see today, the end of that civilizations reign is always near. When the angels appeared in Sodom to rescue Lot and his family, the men there literally tried to rape the angels (who appeared as men).You used the analogy of the woman caught in adultery before. Jesus did not CONDEMN her, but neither did he CONDONE her sin. In fact he specifically tells her to "leave her life of sin" :**( John 8:11 )** ‚ÄúThen neither do I condemn you,‚Äù Jesus declared. ‚ÄúGo now and leave your life of sin.‚ÄùHere is a write-up from someone with a lot more knowledge than myself writing about this topic:[Homosexuality and the Bible](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianCoffeeTime/comments/4ni335/regarding_homosexuality_and_the_bible/)

Demons don't DEFEND Jesus Christ or point to Him as being God. Demons don't point people to scripture or speak truth. They spew only lies and will tell you anything your itching ears want to hear as long as it is against the truth: Jesus is Lord (God).If you think it was mere men that wrote the Bible in it's entirety, you are sadly mistaken.

You assume that I have completely bypassed logic, reasoning and critical thinking and replaced it with some view of magical fairy tales from an invisible man in the clouds. I have done no such thing!!!In fact, the truth is I value those attributes highly, as I will born with them ingrained in me. It is actually part of the reason why it took SO LONG for me to believe and finally understand that the Bible is what it says it is, the Word of God that was given through men via supernatural means, that there is a spirit realm beyond the veil that we cannot see and most importantly that Jesus Christ is what He claimed to be, the Son of God, whom is also God, in a concept that we can only barely begin to conceptualize, let alone comprehend the mere concept of this triune quantum nature of God whom is outside of time and matter.Like you, I couldn't rationalize it in my head. Now I can say that I think I understand why that was now.You are basing your logic & rational thinking off of a foundation of sand and unstable. It is based merely on the intellectual limitations of yourself and other men.> "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,    but fools despise wisdom and discipline." - **Proverbs 1:7**I am basing my new found logic & rational thinking upon the Word of God and the Truth contained within it, thus my foundation is laid upon a Rock, and is stable.> "Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in the ways of this world, he must become a fool to become really wise. *For the wisdom of this world is nonsense in God‚Äôs sight.* For it is written,‚ÄúHe catches the wise with their own trickery,‚Äù and again, ‚ÄúThe Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless.‚Äù - **1 Corinthians 3:18-20**Now, thankfully I can say that I have reached a point (in just over one short year, for what it's worth) that the critical thinking side of me has actually help solidify my faith in Christ and the Word, and I know with certainty because of ssoooo many reasons, I couldn't even begin to list them as to why and do the list any justice. However, one of the major reasons for me personally is due to prophecy. Of which, believe it or not, is evidently going to be continued to be fulfilled later this year according to the dozens of physical, figurative, symbolic and even one big giant literal sign *('in the heavens')*.When I see this Book that was written over a period of 1,500 years by 40+ different authors, that claims divine origin (rightfully so), that literally tells the future with 100% accuracy, that accompanied by the Spirit of God (that is a very tangible and real thing) can reveal the answers to any questions you might have about what the purpose of this life is, why the world is a fallen state of decay that it is, and on and on ... I can't really understand anymore how anyone that has genuinely pursued it and given it a chance (as in actually pick it up and start reading parts of it instead of relying on everyone else's twisted and perverted viewpoints and learn it for yourself) could walk away with anything less than a radically different outlook on this world we live in and where it is headed.---I'll give you one example. You said:> "pay for "sin" that he created in the first place"Of course your logic & reasoning regarding things is going to be incorrect and not correlate correcltly because right here I can tell you that you have a mis-understanding of what sin is, where it came from, and factthat it was **not** God whom ***created*** sin. Thus the foundation on what you are trying to rationalize from and come to a logical conclusion is inherently flawed, thus the outcome will be as well.Try thinking in terms of sin as more of a by-product, or rather the abscence of something. More specifiically, it is the ***abscence*** of a moral code, law, order, justice, light, good, etc. When you turn off a light in your bedroom and it becomes pitch black, what is it that you just did? Did you turn off the normal "light" and turn on the "dark light"? No, you snuffed out the light. There is now an ***abscence*** of light, and you are now permeated in **darkness**.The same is true with cold. Cold is merely the ***abscence*** of heat !!* Without good, there is only evil.* Without light, there is only darkness.* Without heat, there is only cold.* Without God, there is nothing.

Thank you for responding using Scripture. Indeed you are correct, that verse does include the sulfur/brimstone reference as well :> ( **Revelation 21:5-8** ) "And He who sits on the throne said, ‚ÄúBehold, I am making all things new.‚Äù And He said, ‚ÄúWrite, for these words are faithful and true.‚Äù Then He said to me, ‚ÄúIt is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost. He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. **But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death**.‚ÄùIf the idea was based entirely on the use/abscence of that one word, the argument would fall apart. Perhaps this passage is describing a particular group of people? There is a specific group that is clearly not consumed in the lake of fire, and are in eternal torment, seen in this passage:> ( **Revelation 14:9-12** ) "Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, ‚ÄúIf anyone worships the beast and his image, **and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand**, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in **full strength** in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone **in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name**.‚Äù Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus."Take this, and add it to the other examples I listed above, and I can see four groups or individuals listed specifically as having eternal torment.*Revelation 14:9-12* = those who specifically take the **Mark of the Beast** during the Tribulation period are poured out a cup a full strength cup of wrath.*Revelation 19:19-20* = **Beast** (anti-Christ) & **False Prophet***Revelation 20:7-10* = **Devil**There's also the parable of the wheat & the tares, and those being separated, with one being thrown into the fire. Fire consumes everything, it burns it up, there is nothing left but dust and ash. God is often referred to as a "consuming fire". This is why we are presently separated from Him, because of our sin for it must be that way. If any of us were to suddenly be in His presence, we would be absolutely eradicated due to the sin present in us.Notice that both Death & Hades (hell) are thrown into the lake of fire also. They are done away with, for there is no more need for them (hell is a *temporary* prison for spirits). Even the eternal torment listed in the above verses mentions the location specifically as being in the presence of the angels and the Lamb (Jesus). They are not being tormented eternally in hell, because hell no longer exists at that point.Perhaps i'm wrong, it's certainly possible. But I just don't get the impression from reading Scriptures and more importantly from having at least some minute insight into the character of God as it is taught in the scriptures and experienced in my personal life. God is Just & Merciful. These traits would contradict an omnipotent God that is outside of time and sees all that we have done before we have even done it, and yet He would create us fleshly humans, whom he Loves, but condemn that indigenous tribal person tucked away in some remote forest to eternal life in perpetual agony and unimaginable suffering? It just doesn't make sense.Personally I think that absolute annihilation of body, soul, mind and spirit at the Throne of Judgement for those that took the wide path to destruction in this life (which most do, *"for the path is narrow and few will find it"*) is a far more **merciful** act, than to leave them in eternal torment. Nor would that be justice, the crimes did not warrant it. The cup is poured out **proportional** for each individual that is **not covered by the Blood of the Lamb**.Check out a topical study on these concepts. Of course they should be read in context (whole chapter preferably) to get an understanding of the message that is being conveyed. [Consuming Fire](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/phrases/Consuming-Fire/type/nasb)[The Second Death](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/The-Second-Death/type/nasb)[Lake of Fire](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Lake-Of-Fire/type/nasb)[Browse ~9,300 topics](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/type/nasb)---For what it's worth here's something I wrote a year ago that relates to this subject:> We know that UV light kills all bacteria, right? Have you ever thought of God's "light" of having that same effect on the sin that is in each and every one of us? Perhaps He protects us by having a veil between us and Him for if He were to present Himself to us, bathed in His Glory, we would all be immediately eradicated and destroyed because of the sin(darkness) within all of us. Since all (100%) of us have been born into sin, the darkness resides inside us, woven into our very existence, probably into our very own genetic structure on this planet. The very exposure to God/Christ in His true form would completely destroy us as sinners in our fleshly mortal form.> God is perfect. God is love. God is light. He has NO darkness or sin whatsoever in Him. He is completely pure. Not even the smallest amount of sin can be allowed to enter Him (nor can He be tempted by it). No evil comes from Him. He cannot be corrupted by it like we have been. Thus why we must be "reborn" from this earth and reborn from the spirit in Him. Our earthly, physical, fleshly bodies must remain here. The wages of sin, even in the most minute form is made known to us. The wages of sin is Death. Period. No exceptions. Since we have been born into sin, we were doomed to die before we were even born.> The only way the uniqueness and individuality that makes us who we are can be saved is through the free gift of Salvation through Jesus Christ that was given to us by God's grace. A free gift of grace that CANNOT be earned through good works on this earth. Only the acceptance of the FREE GIFT that grants us eternal salvation that is freely and openly available to anyone, anywhere, at anytime, guarantees us a spiritual re-birthing that is free from sin into a heavenly body that Our Lord has prepared for each of us. The flesh must remain here. It is doomed to die and perish in the fires of this world at the end of the age. These mortal bodies were formed from dust, and will return to dust. Our eternal soul can be saved by His grace and our acknowledgement and acceptance of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection, recognizing Jesus as the Son of God, whom paid for our sins by being the last, and most perfect blood sacrifice on the Cross. We as believers in Christ will be reborn anew from within, baptized in the Holy Spirit. We will become Children of God, grafted into His family through the blood and sacrifice that was given to us by the mercy, love and grace from God to us all as a free gift. A gift that we must choose to take of our own free will. You must choose.

I know you're just trolling a bunch of my comments, so I won't waste too much time responding.I can't not but love the irony of how true Truth is so often the exact opposite of what we think and that others say. Like in this case, where the truth is my pastor is a 'good news' evangelist, that teaches foundational & fundamental doctrine of Christianity without a bunch of denominational man-made crap or 'political correctness' added in. He has done so for 40+ years and is very gifted.That being said, he won't touch prophecy with a 1,000ft pole. There's unfortunately too much division caused by those who can't understand pre/mid/post-trib pre/post-wrath, and on and on. These things have unfortunately been stripped out of many modern day churches, which has left so many blind to the epic and blatant signs of the times. I, on the other hand, have basically the opposite issue.

**(1)** Different translations were a big stumbling block for me too early on (and by 'early on,' i mean just over 1 year ago). I prayed about it, asked for guidance. One night I just 'happened' to discover that I had Bibles laying around my house of many different translations all from relatives that have gone on and gave to me, undoubtedly knowing one day I would need them. Some of them I didn't even know existed, let alone ever opened. I think i laid out like 5 different ones that were all from a relative one night. That's an example of prayer answered, and quickly too. Now, I use many different translations. I would highly encourage anyone to NOT stick to just one (many claim only KJV, etc, which is ridiculous). There's plenty of web tools available that let you compare particular verses against many different translations, which is often helpful.Of course, when you can go back to the original Hebrew, Aramaic or Greek, this is your best option. Again, web tools are available such as lexicons and interlinears."In the [beginning](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/7225.htm)"*beginning, chiefest, firstfruits, part, time, principal thingFrom the same as ro'sh; the first, in place, time, order or rank (specifically, a firstfruit) -- beginning, chief(-est), first(-fruits, part, time), principal thing.*see HEBREW [ro'sh](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/7218.htm)Hebrew words have multiple meanings associated with them depending on the context it's used in. There is incredible compound meanings contained within the Bible. God is a masterful author. Many verses even have multiple meanings and interpretations of which ALL can be valid.**Revelation 12:1-2** is a perfect example, where "the woman" represents at least THREE different things, and is talking about events both in the past **AND** future, simultaneously. Because, well, God and all.I also look at the Dead Sea Scrolls that were found in the Qumran Caves 70 years ago as an additional witness to this generation that the texts we have are indeed very accurate. I've read statistics from some scholars that claim 99%+ accuracy, which is astonishing for such an old text (if it wasn't divinely inspired and protected). Different translations speak to different people. I prefer a word-for-word translation, others might like a thought-for-thought. For instance, I can't stand the NLT version, but I know those who love it. It's "simple" and "easy" to understand. If that speaks to them, well great! I prefer to deep-dive and care particularly about accuracy, so I won't touch that version.I think the thing to remember is the Spirit of the Message is intact. No matter if you read a KJV, NIV, ESV, NASB, etc, everyone should come away with the same understanding that Jesus is Lord, and He is our only hope of eternal salvation.EDIT: That being said, there absolutely are false additions to the Word, such as what the catholics add, JWs, Mormons, etc. Stay far away from these deceving doctrines, they are co-written by demons, not God. EDIT 2: Other or "lost" books are a whole other discussion. God doesn't "lose" anything, they were not canonized for a reason. There is clear evidence in the text of the Bible that there are other books, such as Jashar and the Book of War (songs for war). Enoch is most likely one of them too, and these also had many fragments recovered in the Dead Sea Scrolls. If Enoch is divinely inspired, I personally think it was saved and not revealed again until this last generation, knowing that lost/forgotten truths would need to be taught again (Nephilim in particular)[Book of Jashar](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=jasher&qs_version=KJV)

1. God is all powerful and full of love, so God made sure his love letter to you was accessible to you. For the English speaking word it is the King James Bible. It's such a great translation, that I read it and English is my third language and I generally am poor with languages. I truly envy you that you have such a beautiful gift in your native language.  2. You are correct in your assessment of satan. e.g. II Corinthians 2:17 "For we are not as many which corrupt the word of God..." They started their attempt to misinform and lead man astray from the beginning. The book of Enoch is such a misinformation. Same goes for the new translation that get released over and over and over. The new translations through out important parts of the scripture. e.g. Acts 8:37 where the Ethiopian eunuch gets the answer to his question what he needs to do to be acceptable unto Christ. The answer btw. is, you need to belief in Jesus Christ as your God and Saviour. Because you cannot save yourselves, God needs to save you. And that is a gift.   Also the Bible cautions you to judge for yourself, because someone that is fooled and lead astray will get the same punishment as someone who is willfully leading people into damnation. Ignorance is no excuse.  My suggestion: Get a KJV Bible app that offers a reading plan and read the New Testament once. I think three month is a manageable pace. It's really the best and easiest thing you can do. It changed my view dramatically. And I too was a confused catholic who lost his faith :)

I'm not familiar with what their views are on that subject, but i'd like to think that even if they share a similar interpretation on a particular topic that I do, that it is a superficial similarity at best. I am purposefully non-denominational and have no association with cults. There is only One High Priest, whose name is Yeshua.The Tree of Life was in the Garden of Eden, along with the Tree of Knowledge of Good & Evil. Eating from this tree, sentenced all mankind to death and brought forth sin and a curse. Jesus Christ provided the atoning sanrifice by being crucified **ON A TREE**, suspended between Heaven & Earth, which has granted all whom have faith in Him eternal life once again. Note the Tree of Life is mentioned as being in New Jerusalem again in [Revelation 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22&version=TLV).I made a long response (why can't I just do a short quick reply ...) [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6jetnl/rconspiracy_round_table_gnosticism_archons_the/djlh6as/) you might want to read.

there won't be any stupid bots in Heaven either ^ ^

Can this visualisation manifest itself in our actual "reality"?I've just bought the book based on your recommendation, can't wait!

No, the military backs Trump. We are definitely entering a new era. I had a vision/understanding of generation after generation working to make things better. Working toward a heaven on earth. Call me an optimist, but I think we'll be ok. That said, maybe that's just a possible future. Crazy times ahead.

Where in the fuck do you find this stuff out? Is there some kind of site that has all of this info organized and layed out? I need to see for myself. Do you have to abstain from pot and alcohol for a while to do this stuff?  

Transcendental meditation uses a similar technique. You focus on killing your body part by part starting with a toe and working your way up. It too disconnects the spirit from the body. 

Is this just one way to have an out of body experience, or the DMT is what causes any and all OBEs? Once I took a nap and I supposed I was out of my body because I reached the ceiling of my house, crashed through it into the sky and then spiraled into a dark area with red vacuum/spiral tunnel .. not sure if that was caused by DMT in my body, but I had to scream (not through my physical body) to get out of this ; too much to handle at the time. 

> However, if you don't sleep for a long time the DMT will build up in the body and can bring on an out of body experience.   Well that explains a lot... 

mushrooms

Not true at allSource: am a hypnotist 

I heard the sky is blue, too.But that's *totally irrelevant.*

I disagree.The whole concept of God and Nature of Mankind are examples of the very basic foundations of a belief system and those are different between the three main Abrahamic traditions (I just pointed some..)I know what you said, but my answer is "not exactly".

When a loved one passes it is extremely important to maintain contact. This absolutely can be done. It takes some effort, but I am currently doing it. Visualization is our greatest gift and ultimately the strongest ability in creation. Looking at photos and/or videos of loved ones, combined with a meditative use of the inner "visual screen" reestablishes that connection. The mind needs to be saturated with positive imagery of persons and events. If anyone has lost a loved one and needs more info on this, feel free to contact me.

You are a filing cabinet, with one open file. When you found your grandparents, you opened two more files. There's tens of billions of files inside you. One is your wife. You just have to look.

Reddit always throws these incredibly touching comments at me in the strangest of threads.

I agree with you about the "Source". But unfortunately the Archons have created electromagnetic barriers around this closed Matrix. By effectively barricading themselves and everyone else within this Simulation, they have established a system based on Vampirism and Parasitic Behavior.

It seems to be a magnetic process. This is why training outside of the body is extremely necessary but sadly is done by very few. The human energy field/soul can be controlled and directed with out of body training, as well as advanced meditation and visualization development.

I'll never forget a friends experience with Salvia.He said he smoked Salvia and came to a place where he was being, along with other (souls?) around him, pulled towards an inevitability. He said he could hear music unlike anything he'd ever known. (he's a techno producer so that was an interesting feature of his story)He said as he was pulled towards this inevitability he was worried. When he felt that worry he said he could hear the voices of family, almost laughing and reassuring him all is well.He said he then understood that this was the process of death, where the soul and body are separated.

There is an infinite amount of points between 0 and 1. 

Have you considered - what if your trances / visions, and the "knowledge" they seem to profess, are lies? Intentional ones - to keep you from God?>> The greatest fable being that someone died for our sins. Therefore, relieving us of personal responsibility.  The more we think we are Saved no matter what, then the less we care about the bad we have done.This does not sound in any way, shape, or form like what I've come to learn of Jesus. It is the tiniest partial-truth, otherwise known as a lie. I don't mean at all that you are lying (you are clearly seeking truth, a wonderful process, as I am) - I mean that you have been lied to, and it is believable because hypocritical religious people are everywhere. They are not what you find in the words of Jesus - accepting him is embracing love incarnate. Yes, it is the relief of guilt, but for the express purpose of getting on with the business of loving and stopping doing evil.Anyway, I would encourage you to fast, pray for truth, and read the Bible, and PM me if you feel the need. Sorry if this has come across as preachy. It's just that I just went through a similar journey, including a brief stop at Gnosticism. You're nearly there. The veil isn't something you can break through of your own effort and drugs. It's the person of God and he will do it if you just ask.Peace!

I totally understand.  But there seems to be a real conflict between that experience and this one, the one we are in under normal circumstances.  Which one is the real one?  Are they both real, but different dimensions?

I took a large(for me) dose of acid and felt like I broke through into the fifth dimension. I felt like I was falling through the cracks in the moments and I thought reality was dissolving. I soon after watched Interstellar and that scene at the end in the bookshelf was eerily familiar. 

Your just a bunch of chemical reactions! Lol but really, life is made of simple chemical processes and reactions but I would also say that life is a spectacular miracle. My opinion is that everything around you that seems so ordinary, is in fact extraordinary and more complex and beautiful than anything you can imagine, we just are perceiving it through our own distortions of the mind and blinded by ignorance from factthat life is amazing!

True, but the conundrum remains!

I always upvote curiosity. Upvoted!

Thank You

all of what you said is true. but NOT inside this Simulation. you are the "creator". we ALL are. sadly Parasitic Aliens called "ARCHONS" have barricaded themselves and all of us into a small simulation that is cut of from the "Real Free Universe" and the "Eternal Source Energy".  If we work together and raise the Group Consciousness we can transform the prison into a paradise...

I just read Revelations 17-18. I just started reading the bible and your comments interest me a lot and i feel like i can relate to you, all this evil pointed me toward Jesus and God. Could you explain that passage a little more for me please? Im confused but it does kind of make sense when i replace Rome with Babylon because the evil Vatican is located there (i think). Thank you, much appreciated.

Romans 9:14 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth._19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?20. **Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?**21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and anoher unto dishonour?_22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, [...](http://www.libcfl.com/articles/vessels.htm)

I'm not trolling you, I'm presenting logical arguments while you're just citing the fairy tales you believe exist, as if that somehow is an argument for such a thing's existence. And if your pastor is a "good news" evangelist you wouldn't be sitting here quoting Revelation and telling me how I'm going to be snuffed out of existence for using logic and reasoning. More Christians really need to focus on Jesus' teachings rather than the end times, fire and brimstone.

Wait, how did you know he was a bot vs an adoring fan?  Seems he deleted his account.  Or no he didn't.  A 4 year account with no comments.

visualizations can definitely create reality. keep me updated with your progress :)

Joe Rogan has talked about DMT on his radio show. Graham Hancock has gave a TED talk on the subject which was since banned. Check YouTube.

So does dextromethorphan..

DMT will always be linked to any and all OBEs even if other things seem to be the trigger. Even full on death itself involves DMT. When the body dies it releases "death endorphins" which includes DMT. This kicks the soul out of the body and into the spirit realm.

Are you a Vegas-type Hypnotist or a registered clinical psychologist who does reverse hypnotherapy; and if you are the latter, what state are you employed in,  so we all can stay away :)

I mean, true, i see your point. Examples: the fictional Hannibal Lecter held a doctorate yet he killed, cooked, and ate his victims; the factual MKULTRA experiments brutally destroyed their victims' psyches. I completely understand the paranoia there. But from a more realist take on things: a lot of doctors of clinical psychology that practice hypnosis or reverse-hypnosis (when guiding patients through a past-life regression) do so with an open heart and an eager mind prone towards furthering discovery of newfangled knowledge, both for the patient's awareness and their own. For example, look at the excellent work done by Dr. David Jacobs or Dolores Cannon; talk about revealing mysteries of the Archons. Jacobs and Cannon have done very great work in this regard. Jacobs and Cannon have done very similar yet differing work in the same field too. I would check them out by reading their books and articles. Don't look them up on Rational Wiki or some other disinformation hub, because they have been under heavy disinformation internet firing squads for a while now. That should tell ya something about  how precise their findings are.Overall, when a doctor or a shaman is helping to guide you, you are in good hands. There will ways be bad eggs, but if you research for the right people, you will be rewarded.

Actually that's Rayleigh's scattering. 

Now now children play nicely

Broadly speaking, I would go with HorusNoon on this one.  You said Christians are trinitarians, but that is true whilst being unitarian.  You are forgetting that if you are dealing with God, things need not be mutually exclusive and "irreconcilable".  There is an ALL, and that doesn't mean that there isn't a framework or frames of reference for one's experience with God (or w/o).  How would you feel if you were born Muslim?

One time I was in this really dark place. And I was at my computer and mostly out of my mind. I had this little reclining chair off to the side, and I saw this young couple sitting there looking at me that I didn't recognize. And for a moment I felt alright, and I got out of that darkness. Found out my grandmother I loved had passed away, and we went through her stuff and I found a picture of her and my grandfather, who I had never met, in those same outfits. I had been an atheist most of my life, and completely dead to the spiritual, until that moment. And now any time I visualize them in that way it seems to mean something extra. I dunno, is that along the lines of what you are talking about?

You're promoting communicating with evil beings that are taking advantage of human emotion and want for things lost. That's why it's call Rest In Peace. God or the Set-Apart Spirit will not communicate through passed relatives. The accounts of Moses and Jesus show evil sorcery is active and should be avoided such as tarot, weegee boards (Goddamn the spelling), hand life lines, numerology, fretting over numbers or the stars. Our sorcery is to trust in God, worship and fear him, and he will bring the Set-Apart Spirit through us to demonstrate his power to the depraved. The in-your-face evil that comes into our everyday through Satan and his medical/technocratic puppets, is the vaccines they Force upon your younger family members, the food they conveniently place on your tired/overworked path, and the tech they keep you asleep and distracted with. God bless you and take the nag hammadi texts with a grain of salt but deeply study them, especially the ones referencing the Son of Man

Interesting. It would be really nice to be able to open several files. But if I open their file, do they have to open mine as well? Can people open the files of others they do not want to interact with?

I shit you not i had this same experience! I was in high school and about 20 of us were hanging out in my buddy's garage, my gf at the time next to me, I took a bong rip of salvia that my buddy handed me, next thing i know everything became a grid, i could see everyone basically graphed onto a 3D plane and the lines of their cubes were completely visible and consistent when i moved/looked around. Next thing I know I'm being dragged downward into the void and everyone was being stretched as the 3D plane was being pulled in with me, everyone was laughing(obviously) ad when i finally started to return to "normal" i was absolutely terrified. I hadn't remembered this for years but after reading your comment an all the others above, this experience finally makes sense.

I have considered this very thing. In fact Jesus is where I began. I was raised very religious and my faith in the universe is strong. I fast 5 days a week for the entire day, only eating one meal at night, and speak out loud to the universe. Speaking out loud seems to hold some power and asking questions out loud while entering the trance will start a synchronizing of events in your life. Answers to your questions will begin showing up. There is much truth to religious tenants such as prayer, and the laying on of hands. Anyone can be a "prophet" with the right training. Jesus, in fact is the light and life of the world. The Sun of God. The celestial being bringing the light and defeating the dark. This is sun worship. A modern spin on the oldest religion on this planet. The sun dies on the cross. This is recorded by astronomers. Not to say anything negative of your beliefs, it just seems like the begining for you. If you continue on this path and dont draw a line, thinking that you know the ultimate truth then many things will be given. Ask and receive, seek and you shall find. Never stop asking. Especially when you beleive you have found the entire truth.  No greater truth has ever been spoken, except maybe that love truly conquers all hate. Even our galactic prison gaurds cannott prevent love from overcoming. Once we break the veil it is more difficult for them to reapply it to our next life/lives.

I had the realization at the time that when my mind was disconnected in a way from my senses, my mind, for lack of a better word, was able to perceive something other. I don't know what the fuck it was, but it seemed very real though intangible. There were other trips where I only perceived the world around me in strange ways, but twice it was different. So I'd have to say that both are real and not really separate somehow. Crazy.

Ta ;)

interesting. would you compare this to humans' farming of animals for their resources?

*Babylon, the harlot, the prostitute, the whore*. Encompassing the Vatican, the catholic church, the city of Rome itself. All roads lead to rome. The octopus tentacles that stretch to all other nations that have committed adultery with the harlot.(1) - Babylon is mentioned specifically by name by Peter writing from a church in Rome.* **1 Peter 5:13** - "She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son."(2) - The whore (woman) of Babylon that rides the beast is specifically described in Revelation as being a "great city"* **Revelation 17:18** - "And the woman that you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.‚Äù(3) - Rome is synonymous with being the city of "Seven Hills (or Mountains)"* **Revelation 17:9** - "**This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated**;"(4) - in Revelation 18:17+ it speaks of sea captains being able to see the destruction of Babylon that is brought about it in ONE HOUR. The vision given is of an angel throwing a giant boulder sinking it into the sea. The talk of ships alone rule out the possibility of it being Babylon of old on the Euphrates (if you had any doubt), but it certainly makes sense considering the [proximity of Rome](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rome,+Italy/@41.7235785,12.3093878,10.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f6196f9928ebb:0xb90f770693656e38!8m2!3d41.9027835!4d12.4963655) to the sea in addition to all the goods/wealth it trades in. It's destruction during the Tribulation will easily be visible by the smoke that engulfs it.(5) - Finally, going back to the vision given to King Neb. in Daniel 2. The reign of the "gentile kingdoms" began with Babylon of old as represented by the golden head. Followed by medes/persians, greeks, east/west rome, and eventually the revised roman empire of the 10 toes (kings/nations). It began with Babylon. It ends with Rome. *Spiritual Babylon* has persisted through each kingdom. Is it not a perfect poetic ending to be the destruction of the "great city" itself?(6) - Final finally, just look at the state of the Roman Catholic church that exists with its worship of idols, protecting of pedophiles, lust for greed, power and the false Jesuit pope that is desperately trying to "unite" major world religions (islam, orthodox judaism & whatever they call christianity) in preparation for the united world religion that will come onto the scenes during the Tribulation period.

Its comment history was a few phrases repeated over and over in every single one of their posts. Is karma farming a thing?

I'm certified with the national guild as a consulting hypnostist. I specialize in past life regressions, but also help with fears, smoking, weight loss, pain management with your physicians approval. In my state you actually do not have to be certified to practice at all. It's a shame the bad rep hypnotism has, especially in America.In England and a lot of Europe, most hospitals have lay hypnotists on staff to help with healing, recovery, and pain management. Also Many many professional sports 'team psychologists' are hypnotists as well.I don't expect to gain any support or traction here with MKultra and what not, but there is a lot more going on with nefariously programming people then mere hypnotism. Ninja edit: word

I'm sorry but I do not have that trust in a doctor, let alone your average yahoo. I've met bad doctors.Funny how many there are. Don't get your panties in a twist with yer downvoting- I didn't downvote you, pal. In the end I really don't give a shit what you think. All I know is *I don't trust doctors* unless they prove their worth. As for Shamans, pfft. I bet I can meet a good one over at [ the Esalen institute.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esalen_Institute) 

Yes it does. The native americans talked about how when you think of someone it "gives them life again". When you look at or think about someone you are making an energetic connection. You grandmother thought lovingly of you and created a magnetic connection. My grandfather died decades ago, and I am just now reconnecting with him. As we remove the programmed limitations and develop further this will become commonplace.  The dead do not have to be forgotten. We can and will create new energetic connections and portals to them. We will not rest  until every person alive and deceased has the choice to remain as themselves and truly create their own reality...

We're all the same filing cabinet, there's access control, but it's kinda limited.If you go looking for demons, they'll start coming to look for you. You can ask them to leave, some will leave quickly, more powerful ones will be more persistent. Same would presumably apply to spirits/souls. If they want to speak to you, they will. If they want to block you, they may not. It's like an arm wrestling match of wills.

Beautiful. Happy to hear you can understand it better. It definitely is not the most tranquil experience it seems. I never had such an intense experience myself. I personally felt paralyzed... Not sure if I didn't reach the proper threshold or what. Maybe another attempt now that a decade has past. 

On Lsd, did you get a feeling that another dimension or world was out there, only that it was hard to focus on? I felt as if I could peer into this other world if I relaxed my vision for a while, but when I would attempt to focus to see clearly, it disappears again.

Never talked about it, but the one time I took many more shrooms than I probably should have... I walked two blocks from my friends house to my dads house (who also bought some of the same shrooms but was eating like 1 at a time).As I walked under some big trees on a dark night, I felt something watching me... I remember feeling very fearful at first, then overcoming that fear and felt like a being or something opened my mind.At first I was having a hard time maintaining my perception of reality. Everything was so funny, made no sense, and seemed a very different reality from before. I talked with my dad and he looked like a cartoon. I was laying on the couch meditating and I had intense visuals of strange beings, demon like and also beautiful ones that controlled various aspects of reality. My visions were basically of the universe and reality and that a vast interconnected machinery was being controlled by beings or gatekeepers each with a special function and most aware of me and factthat I was aware.I did not communicate directly with any of these beings, as I was seeking different understandings of reality and thought these hallucinations could be hindrances to my higher enlightenment. However the whole time I felt like a special knowledge was being transferred without words and separate from but explaining the machinery of my mind or the universe. The whole experience in general makes me wonder if I was just reaching a certain point of my shroom trip that I just went from doing good and not feeling much effects to full blown mind exploration, or if I was indeed correct in feeling the presence of a higher spiritual being guiding me through an experience and teaching me.

Yes. Absolutely. This Matrix is a PREDATORY SYSTEM on many levels. Like it or not: We are all cut off from the Source Energy. The Archons feed on humans for Loosh Energy. Humans brutally enslave and slaughter animals for their consumption.

Fascinating, thank you so much for the reply. I was waiting on it! This is very interesting, I know all about point (6), it is partly what got me interested in reading the Bible. So much pedophilia and cover ups and EVIL out there at the highest levels! Even the Vatican!I am curious what will bring Jesus back, he talks of great suffering for everyone before his return, it will be a 'terrible time pregnant women and nursing women' and nobody will even have time to go back into their homes to get a jacket. I believe it would only take an hour (or less) to destroy Rome.One question: have you heard of the New World Order the globalist elite have been planning for decades? It seems to be coming to a head and I wonder if this is what is destined to happen to force the Second Coming of Christ.

Who knows.  Seems it was written by someone wanting to tell people they are loved.  Weird, but nice.

People on this sub that chalk hypnosis up to being MKULTRA are clearly confused; MKULTRA had its origins in NAZI SS, later brought to the CIA through Operation Paperclip. On another note, what are some of the stories/experiences you have encountered with your patients' past life regressions? Curious...

Well, take care then. Best of luck on your search for truth.

Kinda like that Robin Williams movie about the afterlife?

Love this analogy. I can wait to see it play out...but I am looking forward to the adventure some day.

Yes, you could describe it that way. I felt as though I was lifted or 'moving upward' through/into something other. Then I saw a white 'room' or space and there were people or beings there and i felt that maybe there were others there like me as well, but when I tried to focus/observe it, I 'fell' out and away from it. Sorry for the vague words but its hard to convey the experience. It was strange. Only happened once that I felt transported in this way.

thank you for this inspiring conversation

Know that there is nothing that can "force" the hand of Christ to come back at any other time other than that which is appointed already by the Father. The NWO that is going to come to complete fruition during the 7 year tribulation period may think they are running according to  their time schedule, but they are not. God has already seen exactly what they have planned, and has told us the future of all these things through His Word. When they go "underground" in their caves and bunkers that have been building for decards, they will be nothing more than billion-dollar tombs for them and all the other wicked serveants of satan.They will fail, they will fall. Including Rome that will be destroyed in a day from judgement from above.All the signs are already here, and they converge in Fall, this very year. The verse you are quoting is from the Olivet Discourse in the Gospels where Jesus is specfiically talking about an event that happens in Jerusalem exactly 3.5 years into the tribulation with the anti-Christ sets up his abomindation of desolation in the re-built 3rd temple (which is already planned out and ready to be built very soon)

Well I don't feel comfortable divulging any of my patients past live regressions, but they range from Egyptian high times, biblical times, Raw energy like forms, American Frontier, on and on.I'll share my past life regression a fellow hypnotist guided me through.   I was in Ancient Egypt and my job was to manage food production and distribution. I oversaw the field workers and set up festivals to celebrate our holidays. In our religious perspective, we had great appreciation for Opposites, for Dark and Light, Night and Day, Good and Evil, we held them together in esteem.  An essential part of my job was to keep the upper and lower class happy. So over the years, we increased our festivities and celebrations. Then one year we had a severe drought and our crops were decimated. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place, trying to keep the labor class fed while simultaneously appeasing the upper class who had become accustom to a lavish lifestyle and extravagant festivals quite often. Well it didn't end well for me. The labor class stormed my household and destroyed it. My beautiful wife was killed in front of me for resisting. I was taken to the fields where I pleaded for their understanding, offering to work the land with them, but, then I too was killed. So ya, that was my personal experience with past life regression

Thanks guy, maybe I'll see you in r/occult

yes. that movie is very well done and similar to what we are talking about.

Fascinating every time I talk to you man. Making pictures in my mind of these things I could only see the edges of. Thank you.

My father passed away about a year ago, if he fell for this light trap you speak of, does that mean he has been recycled and it is not possible to contact him? 

I know right this guy is the fucking best i would pay tons of worthless earth money to go camping and take dmt with him 

99.9 % of deceased people end up in the Astral Afterlife. Very few advanced souls escape this simulation and enter the real free universe. your dad can be visited in the astral afterlife. it is difficult but it can be done.

Haha, exactly.

I don't want to take up too much of your time and I have nothing to offer you in return but how? Can you point me in the right direction?                                          

I ask NOTHING in return friend. Feel free to ask anything you like. Use as much time as you need. Be very specific and I will help you any way I can   :)

I'm obsessed with Google earth and I'm constantly looking at Antartica. It might be due to the satellite imaging and image stitching, but the continent is heavily edited. I try to rule in the most reasonable explanation like melting ice moving, difficulty capturing the land on satellite, glitches, ect. There are a lot of places that are extremely blurry or whited out and you can tell because the land next to it will be clear as day and you can zoom in very far. I have a lot of screenshots of things I've seen that aren't necessarily conspiracy related, just things I thought were cool.

[The Piri Reis Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piri_Reis_map):>The Piri Reis map is a world map compiled in 1513 from military intelligence by the Ottoman admiral and cartographer Piri Reis.>There are two major discrepancies from known coastlines: the North American coast and the southern portion of the South American coast. On the Piri Reis map, the latter is shown bending off sharply to the east starting around present-day Rio de Janeiro. >A more popular interpretation of this territory has been to identify this section with the Queen Maud Land coast of Antarctica. This claim is generally traced to Arlington H. Mallery, a civil engineer and amateur archaeologist who was a supporter of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact hypotheses. >Though his assertions were not well received by scholars, they were revived in Charles Hapgood's 1966 book Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings. This book proposed a theory of global exploration by a pre-classical undiscovered civilization based on his analysis of this and other ancient and late-medieval maps.>As far as the accuracy of depiction of the supposed Antarctic coast is concerned, there are two conspicuous errors. First, it is shown hundreds of kilometres north of its proper location; second, the Drake Passage is completely missing, with the Antarctic Peninsula presumably conflated with the Argentine coast. >The identification of this area of the map with the frigid Antarctic coast is also difficult to reconcile with the notes on the map which describe the region as having a warm climate.What the Wikipedia article fails to mention here is that the theory is that Piri Reis was using source maps that depicted Antarctica from *at least* 10,000 years ago, so the climate would've been vastly different.Despite consistently [only providing one source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piri_Reis_map#cite_note-dutch-36) to "debunk" the Antartica-in-Piri-Reis-Map Theory, the Wikipedia article ends with this statement:>serious scholarship holds that there is no reason to believe that the map is the product of genuine knowledge of the Antarctic coast.As usual, Wikipedia passes off a conspiracy theory as "debunked and settled" when the jury is very much still out.

[Operation Highjump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Highjump):>Operation Highjump (1946‚Äì1947) was a United States Navy operation organized by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, Jr. Task Force 68 included 4,700 men, 13 ships, and 33 aircraft. Operation Highjump's primary mission was to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV.After a fatal aviation accident, a death from a "ship-unloading accident" and increasingly poor weather conditions, the Operation was terminated early.The enigmatic [Admiral Byrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Byrd) subsequently made the following cryptic statements on his return home:>Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. >The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. >Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States.

In Graham Hancock's 'Fingerprints of the Gods', he (spoiler alert) ends the book, which talks about links between many ancient civilizations, with a note of why he thinks Antarctica could actually be the 'lost continent of Atlantis'.Now, I don't have the book in my hands, currently, so these are not direct quotes... but, let me try to summarize.Basically, I believe he said it was one of Einstein's theories, that if there *was* a 'polar shift', 10-12,000 years ago, that it could've been caused by the crust of the earth sliding.  Basically, separating from the layers underneath.  Hence, why we see 'flash frozen' woolly mammoths and the like.  It would've been a sudden, violent change in climate for many parts of the earth.  Now considering that we're talking about a pole shift of 15-30 degrees 'off-axis', that doesn't seem like much... until you look at Australia.  Australia and Antarctica have very different climates, currently.  However, that same 15-30 degree shift could basically move Australia southward to where Antarctica is, currently, while simultaneously shifting Antarctica north (since you can go further south than the south pole), into the range of Australia.I feel like I'm not really doing his hypothesis justice, but it's definitely worth the read.

DISCLAIMER: NO SOURCESAfter many a late night conspiracy discussion between me and some of my like minded friends we have come to this conclusion(at least it is one of the more entertaining).Prior to 12000 B.C.E. their existed advanced human civilizations which held much deeper understanding of their place in the cosmos and of the energies which compose the cosmos. Due to some (unknown) event of astronomical proportions the Earth was subject to a major pole reversal triggering the current mini-ice age which our planet is currently undergoing. As human induced climate change (think human impact rather than 'oh no humans gonna kill the planet') has steadily increased as our planetary civilization reemerges from the ashes of our past; in conjunction with shifting of the axis, we are I believe in the transitioning stage of another pole reversal, and soon(if it isn't already taking place). This period where we are shifting back into either an old way or a new way, is when knowledge of our ancient past and the abundance of life will be slowly disseminated to the masses. Using climate change as the guise under which to work, in the coming years (as the global temp increases) expect to see damning evidence of our ancient past and technologies far beyond anything we can currently comprehend or use. It is my belief, and solely mine, that the 'priest class' and the 'elites' have used secret societies throughout history to screen occasional individuals who rise above the masses through either intellect, power, or other means of influence. It is precisely these schools of "esoteric" knowledge which conceals the long known truth that our species contains much greater intelligence and potential than we are currently being educated to believe we have. This 'grand conspiracy' to keep the masses dumb and under-educated is less out of malice and more out of factthat our re-emerging culture has up until this point, not been ready to psychologically accept the consequences that would come from an ancient advanced human civilization ( to the point which would make our current intelligence and technologies seem like child's play). And that we are now progressing through this transition period where our species can reconnect with our ancient past and hopefully proceed with an enlightened and kind curiosity guiding our species through the Cosmos together. But that was all buzzed hopeful armchair bullshitting. But hey, I can hope can't I?

No Antarctica conspiracy discussion is complete with mention of it being a possible entrance to Hollow Earth. The name of the theory sounds rather sensational, but [the evidence supporting the idea is rather compelling](http://humansarefree.com/2011/05/hollow-earth-agartha-complete.html). The Nazis were fascinated with Hollow Earth as well, and I don't believe they would have pursued it as much as they did if there was absolutely nothing to it.What really makes me lean toward the theory is that [other planets and moons in our solar system have mysterious holes at their own poles](http://www.thedailysheeple.com/another-hole-at-another-pole-weird-hole-photographed-on-mars-south-pole-nasa-has-no-idea-what-it-is_042017).

AGARTHA!!!

I think they are building military bases there that they don't want the public to know about and also that there are visible fossilized remains of pre-dinosaur mega-creatures that they don't want the public to know about.

Sup with the area showing a huge gravitational anomaly ? If you were a philanthropist wouldn't that be a top notch site? For whateverI think its a chunk of the old world, still frozen in time when the rest of the world was wiped clean, from flooding and the receding glaciers. 

So called "regular" people will probably never get to explore Antarctica. All public tours and cruises seem to be owned by the same company...

I'm always interested in "art imitating life" which seems to occur in many conspiracy theories. Whether this is because theories are a little fictional and borrow from media or whether media borrows from rumours and theories is a contentious issue.However, it is so fcking intriguing that nearly 2 decades after the X-Files movie, the plotline is so similar to many Antarctic conspiracy theories.To even put a cherry on that, those of you who remember the X-Files will remember the "well-manicured man", who when the CIA needed to start a smear campaign against, said, "yes, what is it they are saying this time? Drug user or pedophilia? They say anything and everything to discredit their threats"...this is a real close link to p-gate imo.

I'll mostly be a spectator for this interesting topic, but the first thing I think of when I think of Antarctica conspiracy theories is how Werner von Braun took a little expedition down there c. 1967, just a couple years before men were to walk on the "moon" on the Apollo 11 "mission."

We know that since homo sapiens evolved, we have been a seafaring species. There is even evidence to suggest that homo erectus had some seafaring capabilities.We know that the global sea level was about 125/150 meters lower than present prior to the end of the last ice age.From this we can deduce that in all likelihood our ancestors explored and settled vast amounts of land that have been submerged or climatologically uninhabitable for the past 12,000 years. Ancient human settlements in Antartica seem quite plausible, if not probable.

Where to start...Our sun is in a binary orbit with another star, Sirius, creating a roughly 26,000 year cycle in which it moves from lower energy to higher energy and back again. (Actually a trinary system with the Sun and Sirius A orbiting Sirius B, best I can tell, but it's simpler to visualize just a binary system.) This energy level affects all species' level of consciousness, but there will be one new dominant species, or "root race", per cycle -- humans, this time around.Here's a quickie primer:- [A Shortend Version of The Great Year, narrated by James Earl Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVjNRCup-e0)We're just at the beginning of the new Great Year, just leaving the darkest age -- the Kali Yuga or Iron Age. I suspect we're still being ruled, at a planetary level, by the dominant race of the previous Great Year -- call them the Atlanteans or Nephilim. More specifically, it's the Satanic faction of that race, the Angelic faction having long since left our planet to explore space. Would you rather serve in Heaven... or rule in Hell?So in short, I think the Satanic faction of the Atlanteans are ruling the planet from a hollowed out area under the Antarctic ice.Kubla Khan - Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1798)> In Xanadu did Kubla Khan > A stately pleasure-dome decree:> Where [Alph, the sacred river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alph_River), ran > Through caverns measureless to man> Down to a sunless sea. ...That ice is now melting, and they will be exposed. There is supposedly a lot of activity going on in Antarctica now. I suspect the Deep State is throwing a military shield up for them, now that they're losing their cover.They use advanced technology, developed in their Great Year cycle -- and some held over from previous cycles -- to rule over us, staying one step ahead. I believe Silicon Valley is their outlet to re-develop and release this technology to the public at a measured rate, as it benefits them -- from cell-phones to electric cars.On a side-note: I'm starting to suspect that all this [crypto-currency activity](http://coinmarketcap.com/) is, essentially, R&D for their new one-world currency and blockchain technology that will tokenize every aspect of life and utterly enslave us into a New World Order. And here we thought we were throwing off the chains of banks. *I-rony!!*Will the Angelic faction return to rescue us? Was [Rush's *2112*](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rush/2112_20119899.html) prophetic? Stay tuned!----Lots of speculation, for sure, but a lot of things have clicked into place for me. Like the whole Giza pyramid complex makes a lot more sense now -- they were trying to tell us about Sirius! Anyhow, It's a fascinating area of study that has really reshaped my view of history. Here's a longer playlist if you want to dig into this stuff:- [The Growing Earth, Yuga Cycle, Sirius B Connection](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7zhSARqcOEtsz7sZMVXke2tT-tNtJ5Or)I hope this makes some sense and that others can modify or extend some of these ideas.

Does anyone believe Hitler escaped to Antarctic?  I watched a conspiracy show on Netflix about how the nazis had a secret Antarctic base.  Show also cited artic marine training as secret attacks on said base. 

So I have read that in Operation Fishbowl they tested high altitude nukes. There is a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica and it is attributed to global warming. Why is Operation Fishbowl not ever mentioned as the reason for the hole?

Does anyone have any pics of the military nuking the dome from Operation Dominic? Like in this video https://youtu.be/AkujMTSFr9o

I was filling out my tax form the other day and noticed that united states antarctic programme workers file their taxs through the New Zealand system with an IR56 form is this a way to get the employees of the United States books? So FOIA can't disclose the people working here? Thoughts? http://www.ird.govt.nz/payroll-employers/make-deductions/special-workers/emp-deductions-special-workers.html#ir56  

I'm waiting for some leaked pictures or memos to blow everyone's minds. There is only so long you can hide things in a world with cameras everywhere :).

I want to believe.

Thank you to this thread for reminding me why I subbed here a few years ago

My theory on this Antarctica "conspiracy" is popular fiction has, over the years, seeped into the sub-conscience and as a result people jump to wild speculation about simple scientific or tourist trips to the continent. Sorry to poop on your parade. check this out.https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/19949.Stories_set_in_AntarcticaEspecially this one.  Ice Station by Matthew Reilly And Raising Atlantis by Thomas Greaniais

I have shitcanned the direction of this sub over the last year but this is a really good initiative. /u/axolotl_peyotl 

12 countries originally signed the Antarctic treaty now it has 53 countries. If you look at images of we're the bases are(probably not acetate) they secure the entire Antarctic zone and the surrounding waters around the continent. Why do you think they need tanks down there? Permanent bass and a no go zone for civilians? They either keeping us outta there or they keeping something from coming to our continents. Idk but I want to go and take a peek if you ask me.

My thoughts on Antarctica are ..Since all the countries have nukes pointed at each other this would be a perfect place for the elite to wait out a nuclear holocaust. 

These round tables are the best thing to happen to /r/conspiracy in a long time, really entertaining to read through just to hear all these wild topics 

So what's up with the weird wave anomalies coming from the area recently? I also wonder if there really are nephilim trapped / imprisoned under the ice. 

[Here is something I typed up some months ago about Antarctica](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5snd51/original_research_antarctica_will_be_a_false_flag/)I'd like to go back through and make it a little bit more coherent, but the main gist remains the same. Since writing that I've become entirely more convinced that there most likely **are** ancient ruins under the ice in Antarctica. Graham Hancock's extensive compilation of work identifying an ancient advanced civilization is impeccable. The most likely place for Plato's Atlantis has to be an Antarctica that was probably in a more tropical climate about 13,000 years ago.I still think that the recent hype around it was manufactured to some degree - Antarctica would be the perfect place to begin a Disclosure process via some ancient artifact.

Also the Rothschild Island in Antartica.

I don't believe this, but here's a fun, totally speculative theory (related to the black goo one): Anyone see that movie Life (w/Jake Gyllenhall and Ryan Reynolds)? SPOILER: At the end, the alien life reaches an Earth ocean. Let's suppose something like that (or, of course, the creature from The Thing) landed in Antarctica (lucky for us). Not 10,000 years ago, but maybe like 5-20 years ago. It's been growing, absorbing other life, but possibly at a slower rate due to the cold--maybe its been hibernating. Or it's been growing constantly, yes, but its still decades away from being large enough to spread/be a real threat. Maybe there are secret research teams there attempting to figure out how to kill this thing or stop it from spreading further (again, think of the creature from "Life" or the black goo from Prometheus if you prefer).

I wonder if we'll ever find out just whats going on in the Antarctica?Can some wealthy dude not fly a drone over the ice wall to see if there really is  hidden land and an ancient race of people.

[Jesus you guys are a little late to the bandwagon huh](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6cduxt/antarctica_what_do_you_know/dhtvqym/).

I just pulled this out of my ass and take it for what it is. They discovered what seemed like human activity that resembled advanced technology for it's time. They can't mechanically get to it, so they are ego-engineering to melt Antarctica to reach these ancient settlements. This also has a side benefit of melting the Northern Arctic which they plan on exploiting the new access for oil and gas. They didn't count on melting the permafrost and releasing tons of methane - or did they because it would accelerate their motives. The Nazis knew about this somehow, and now we have this "treature trove" of Nazi Artifacts in Argentina. The Nazis went to Argentina because it was also close to Antarctica.  The super powers of the world each received a portion of the "brain trust" from the Nazi era. Those Brian Trusts are dying, and they are rapidly deploying new technologies that they have mastered before they are all gone. Now that the last survivors of WW2 are physically dying and taking secrets to the grave, all their technologies that have developed and been suppressed will be unleashed, including Tesla and Einstein. 

I was browsing Hollywood movies from the years '47 to about '53 using primarily Wikipedia and discovered two or three movies that had similar themes about discovering otherworldly stuff in Antarctica.  One of the movies was later remade into John Carpenter's *The Thing* but an earlier one was really intriguing and about something like a military base under the ice.  I'm too lazy to find links now but there's an interesting very general trend about increasing numbers of sci-fi movies produced from this period onward where previously they were basically nonexistent.  Wikipedia's movie lists by year aren't comprehensive though.  It might be an interesting project for film historians.  There were probably some interesting TV and radio sci-fi shows too but I'm not curious enough to compile a list of them at the moment. 

I like this one

I think there‚Äôs something there that would blow religion wide open and they need to kip a lid on it to help keep order

We're going to be seeing a lot of information about Antarctica being disclosed in the near future. Keep an eye out for news articles slowly dropping more and more hints at factthat there's a lot of shit down there we haven't been told about.Last time I dove into this conspiracy, there was a lot of evidence that an ancient civilization lived there, and another cool theory that Nazi's fled there after WWII, meaning that we didn't actually win the war. I'm at work so I can't really track down links, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6y5TxpDvbs) sums it up nicely.

SERPO ALIENS SAVED U.S. FROM NAZIS BUT OUR MILITARY CO-OPTED & HID FREE ENERGY & SPACE TECHNOLOGY Hear Kasten Interview at   http://wp.me/p1TVCy-3rV1963, WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, NEW MEXICO: Just after sunset, runway lights flooded the runway where President Johnson and fifteen of his highest military and civilian bosses saw the disk from our ET allies‚Äìthe Ebes‚Äìpop in and settle down. Our people knew already regarded the Ebes as allies; they‚Äôd saved us from the Nazis in 1947 when we feared the Nazis in Antarctica would strike America with fighter disks like those they used to beat Admiral Byrd‚Äôs armada in the Antarctic battle of the Weddell Sea. The disks the Ebens helped us develop warded off a Nazi invasion.Now, in ‚Äô63, a tall, lanky extraterrestrial humanoid, Ebe2, emerged from a hatch; she wore a coverall dark blue bodysuit. She was here for a four-hour visit. Ebe2 announced in English that she had as gift to Earth, the Yellow Book. The Yellow Book, she said, shows the viewer all Earth‚Äôs history and the history of the galaxy as well.Len Kasten, in Secret Journey to Planet Serpo writes that as Ebe2 and the Americans spoke a screen in her translation device showed a printed form in both Eben and in English. She read the form aloud in English.Her two flight companions loaded their craft with the nine bodies of the Ebes who‚Äôd died in the Roswell and Kingman scout-disk crashes and landings. They also loaded the body of Ebe1, the mechanic who‚Äôd survived one of the crashes. Ebe1 had helped us contact Serpo and arrange for the exchange program, Crystal Knight, that would bring twelve Americans to Serpo in the Zeta Reticula system, 240 trillion miles from earth. Ebe2 said she and an Ambassador would return to Earth in two years. The Ambassador would remain and help the U.S. for twelve years while twelve Americans lived and study on Serpo.The meticulously documented record of the exchange program Kasten gives us in ‚ÄúSecret Journey‚Äù lets us see proof of the exchange program and the Yellow Book? President Kennedy made it happen.The Ebes had been helping us since 1947, in a program run by President Eisenhower‚Äôs MJ 12 Committee and the Nazi-infiltrated CIA. MJ 12 included the ‚Äúdeep throat‚Äù whistleblower who put the story on the web. Kennedy wanted to cut off Allan Dulles, a Nazi sympathizer and the CIA chief (which was rife with pardoned ex-Nazis) from the Serpo Exchange Program. Kennedy felt the CIA had marred his presidency with their failed invasion of Cuba. He wanted the Serpo exchange program to be his triumphant legacy. And he wanted the program out of the hands of Dulles and the CIA. So Kennedy created the Defense Information Agency to take over all defense coordination. He charged the new agency to, as much as possible, share to our governments agreements with aliens and the technology they shared that could improve life on Earth. Thank Kennedy and his DIA for the documents and leaks to the website www.serpo.org.The website leader, probably a member of MJ12, wrote,‚ÄúThe Yellow Book is an 8 x 11 inch object 2 1/2 inches thick made of a clear, heavy fiberglass. The border of the book is bright yellow.‚Äù When the viewer puts his eyes near the book and the device reads his electromagnetic aura, images appear, as do words in any of the 80 human languages the viewer uses. ‚ÄúPictures tell the story of the Ebes lives, their exploration of the universe, their planet, their societal life and the Ebes longtime relationship with Earth.‚Äù The Yellow book showed their first ambassador to Earth, some 2000 years ago, was Jesus.Get more of the story at     http://wp.me/p1TVCy-3rV

Since polar shift is a reality, and both poles are known to move location. Can we ever be fully sure of Antarctica as a whole? There is land below the ice which is probably stupid rich in minerals. On top of that the #1 spot of all magnetic anomalies has to be at our poles. Which means Antarctica is folly to some bizarre things. Plasma induced mysteries we are far from understanding. Antarctica has yet to be claimed right? So does that mean the next war will be for the Holy Land of Antarctica. Which could melt away all that Ice, and be the biggest treasure of this era? 

I dug thru a whole bunch of Army, CIA and DIA FOIA releases about Antarctica from the 50s and 60s and 70s. From what I gathered there didn't appear to be anything of quantifiable value down there... it was more like all the secrecy and hubbub about Antarctica arose from factthat Antarctica exploration was viewed as an equivalent of the "Space Race". People were using it to show off the technological and scientific prowess of their various nations. USA was worried USSR would actually find some use for Antarctica and it would be embarrassing for US. There was a bit of worry that USSR could find a strategic advantage down there via surveillance since all other forms of military were banned via treaty. Later on in the 80s there was some talk CIA about how they thought Soviets used Argentina as a sock puppet to take the Falkland Islands to secure a shipping route by sea out of Antarctica for coal exports. 

Oohhhh!  I like this topic!!!

For sake of argument, let's say there's something hidden in Antarctica. Now what? No one here is going to do anything but pat themselves on the back and post youtube footage. : Shrugs: 

I like

The superpowers are probably just trying to divy up any resources that have been discovered under the Ice.

It looks that a [big chunk of ice](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-antarctica-iceberg-idUSKBN19X19Z) from Antarctica broke away, one of the biggest ever recorded. I wonder if it is somehow related with the supposed digging there..

One of the most interesting concept was that U-boat would follow a river from the coast going under the ice until they reach a small lake that might have a hot spring that would cause a dome to create above the lake.

New Swabia Nazi Base Bro. Argentina was just a test run for the U boat led exodus.

Is it not suspicious high ranking and religious people are visiting there and every country Flys a flag and gets along there? NK has an Antartic research base there along with US,Russia and a few others but the NK base has heated toilet seats and a nuclear barge for breaking ice better than the US ü§î. They all work together to research. Check out some youtube documentaries. There's also VERY clear footage people took flying in a helicopter throughout antartica...way clearer than Google Earth lol. Its a beautiful place and I believe there's definitely something there worth researching.Edit:spelling

Google actually uses airplanes for most detailed mapping. They use satellite imaging for the poles. Many of these satellites are in equatorial orbit so they are taking images at very acute angles and laying them over the globe. That's part of why it's so glitchy looking, at least the innocent reason. -I really wish we could see more detailed image mapping of the poles. There are polar orbit satellites but they're mostly military or for weather satellites that don't do image mapping. 

I am VERY late to the party on this topic. I would like to make a quick reading suggestion though. I have also spend a great deal of time looking at maps and reading about Antarctic history, conspiracy, and legends, and if you get the chance, read "At the Mountains of Madness" by HP Lovecraft. First of all, it is a pretty quick read. Second it NAILS the real geography of the area for at least the first 3rd to half of the story. Finally it actually introduces a LOT of the legends and conspiracies that people have historically associated with Antarctica, which is impressive considering it was written in 1931 (thus no Nazi stuff).That story runs the gamut from Lost History, Hollow Earth, Ancient Astronauts, to Genetic manipulation causing the creation of modern man. It was also that story that kicked of my obsession with Lovecraft, and led him to be one of if not my favorite author. I can't advise that one strongly enough. It is also in the public domain, so you can get it for free in ebook without much effort.

I spent two weeks trying to find good, detailed imagery of Antarctica and finally gave up. This, when supposedly the ice caps are melting and going to kill us all, so we'd better keep a close eye on it. Fuckery is afoot.

Wow I know what I'm doing for the rest of the work day. Your pics are wild.

Many of these aren't in Antarctica. One is definitely Russia, and a few others look like Arizona or Nevada. 

 

Almost nobody will benefit from clear images of that region, this is why google "tried their best" with the data they have. I want to say to any 'conspiracy researcher' - you will never find any good data from Google or any other company that provides mapping data - from these kind of regions. It just doesn't make any business sense.Google (which uses atlas and a number of other sources as far as I know) does their best with this limited data, blocked out regions are not secret bases, they are simply not mapped enough to provide a suitable image for their business services. It's fucking simple. The only way to get the data you want from these regions is if you put a satellite out there which can consistently and accurately map those specific points. It'll cost you - but it's not prohibited in any way (as far as I know). (edit) There are, now that I think about it - some areas that are "blocked out" or scrambled because of governmental interference or interaction, but you will never browse Google Maps, or any other map thing online, and find alien craft crashed or whatever, you will never find that. That is a dead end, I assure you.

Redtop canyon is in nevada, where are the rest of your pics from?

Whats in the 4th picture? can you give me the coordinates.

Those are super cool! How'd you find those spots? Just panning around the continent?

Great pictures. Really reaffirms my curiosity as to what the hell is going on down there.

Its because the Earth is flat and they have to create the "continent" of Antarctica through heavy editing.

Wow any idea what those are in the first photo? Bulldozers? If so that is a massive excavation project.

Are you saying red top canyon is in Antarctica or is that apart of your random images. 

Thank you for linking all these, this is an area of great interest to me.An aside, I think these table discussions are a good thing. +1 internet.

I like this one the best: https://gizadeathstar.com/2017/02/uhm-british-scientists-looking-antarctica/The source is this subreddit..

Links arent working now, i think server crashed. I was able to read a couple before they all went down.

Holy shit thank you for all of these

The glowing orb article is kind of BS.... if you google image the pictures and click through them all you can the orb was being rolled around and if you look at about 20 diff pictures you can see all the continents. 

Thank you for these links! 

Damn it, hoping for a shred of evidence of anything damning. This is a list of rumours and speculation, thoroughly disappointing.  

I'm pretty skeptical of the Antarctic conspiracy but you made my night wth all these sources to read over. Always interesting either way

Jon Kerry's speech at Antarctica base.     https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FlC7Q9xS78k

Those are all from the same website...

I know I may be a bit late to the party but do you happen to know another source for the new videos of the German Antarctic expedition? They've been taken down and from what I can tell scrubbed from the internet. Would love to watch if anyone has those videos or knows where to find them!

There is definitely something afoot in Antarctica. I speculate that, as you said, before the cataclysmic end of the last ice age around 12,000 year ago (10,000 BC) Earth's climate, sea level, and general landscape were quite different and therefore contemporary cultures and civilizations may have had knowledge of the Antarctic continent and even settled there. I also accept that the ruling class of our current iteration of civilization are keeping this knowledge from us due to the grand implications of such ancient knowledge. That being said, we need to let go of the Piri Reis map as the golden idol of evidence on this matter. It takes 1 minute for any objective person to do a side by side comparison of a modern map versus the Piri Reis map and see that all the distinct coastal points sloping to the east of the Piri Reis map are simply the capes, bays, and peninsulas of modern Argentina drawn without proper calculations of the Earth's curvature. There are countless examples of Piri Reis's cartography showing this same problem.To reiterate, I accept the premise but not because of the Piri Reis map. We don't need the map. We have the climate models and projections of global temperature and sea level that prove a multitude of continent sized land masses (Atlantis, Lemuria, Yonaguni, Bimini, Sri Lanka, Australian land bridge, Antarctic land bridge, etc) were above water prior to the cataclysmic end of the last ice age. This map is one of the things that our detractors will associate with us because it is unprovable. We should stick to the empirical data when discussing this turbulent time period. 

If you're into the equally interesting "Expanding Earth" conspiracy, the problems concerning the displacement of South America and other surrounding areas can in fact be explained and wouldn't have been inaccurate on the Reis map but the map itself, or the original it came from would have been much further back in time than has been speculated. Although the whole vid is worth watching the situation with Antarctica is shown at 1:40 into it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfBSc6e7QQ

10,000 years ago wouldn't Antarctica have been much *colder*? 

Great response! Thanks

Why do Wikipedia articles just love to have that tone of "nothing to see here,  all disproven" on anything slight contentious 

Looks like a land bridge to Antarctica and a few large islands/continents where the Caribbean is. 

e: I can see in later posts you agree it's likely the map is simply incorrect.Yet, if you read the [debunk source](http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/pseudosc/piriries.htm) it's exceptionally concise and removes the need for further debunk sources.>We can see the Piri Reis Map bears no resemblance at all to Antarctica. The 600-mile wide Drake Passage is not shown, nor are the large islands in the Weddell Sea. The latitude is thousands of miles off.When something is wrong, it's wrong. No confusion about it.

He also mentioned vast swathes of untapped natural resources, yeah? 

Look at all that numerology o_OAlso year 1 of the CIA, like Roswell.

Doesn't that come off as him attempting to solidify support for a second mission, and validate expenditures and deaths?

Wait wait wait. You're telling me Einstein believed it could have been possible for the entire outer crust of the Earth to slide over the mantle and literally flip upside down, quickly enough to flash-freeze a mammoth?What the fuck?

> Prior to 12000 B.C.E. their existed advanced human civilizations which held much deeper understanding of their place in the cosmos and of the energies which compose the cosmos. Why don't we detect any remnants of this civilization in ice cores from that time?

You summed up perfectly my thoughts on Antartica!

I think there's a mars connection here. Js. 

tldr: Current Human Supremacists can't admit advanced civilisations existed prior to our amazing "technological revolution".

Fun thoughts... I like it

It's a nice dream. I'd prefer to imagine our top human contributors as cautiously wise individuals than ignorant greedy, idiotic, malicious parasites.

What do you make of the inner earth theory? I've been fascinated with it for a while now, and decided to devote today towards researching. Seeing your post was a really cool sync.I watched this documentary yesterday, which introduced me to professor James Hurtak. I haven't heard of him before, but his information seems pretty on point. He's a shadowy figure though... if you google him, there's barely any info, and even a couple articles bashing his credibility. I'm starting to think that his name has become deliberately sanitized within the truth seeking community, because of how close his research came. His books are also priced insanely high on amazon, which is very suspicious, as if steering people away. He speaks of 7 points of power on our planet, where pyramids / other ancients structures were built, which are entrances into inner earth: https://youtu.be/N25LSi2qLOQI then stumbled across this video, of an apparent gateway into inner earth, via one of the poles: https://youtu.be/Vadj0Nkby58Putting its credibility aside, if you search for Sunil Lama in the comments, he's a Nepal native who comments how knowledge of these entrances was passed down to him from his grandparents. He also mentions 7 entrances, so this is knowledge from oral tradition, which verifies James Hurtak's work.EDIT: Found out today that the gateway vid was a CGI project (not surprised), but factthat inner / hollow earth entrances are spoken about in ancient oral traditions of native people is very intriguing to me: https://youtu.be/Dua07C30ck0factthat pilots are always ordered to fly around the poles is also extremely suspicious. I just listened to this interview of a naval officer telling his story: https://youtu.be/GMybJ-HGUOoI intend to make an organized post about this at some point, but am still researching. I also read Admiral Byrd's flight logs / story, which blew me away. That holes in other poles article you linked to is fascinating btw, and adds more fuel to this fire. What do you make of it all? Personally, I think there's something to it, and am seeing all the connections now... deliberately shifting attention to a flat earth debate, creating more division, which buries all discussion of an inner earth, inhabited by highly advanced civilizations. There's a lot of buzz around Antarctica lately, but whenever the inner earth component is brought up, it's harshly countered by flat earth chatter. As I research inner earth further, I'm seeing the FE mechanism / psy-op with much more clarity.EDIT: A new Dark Journalist interview with Joseph Farrell, about Antarctica / Admiral Byrd, just uploaded recently. Looks like it was a good time for me to dive into this, the synchronicities are piling up...https://youtu.be/34MD7v-W2x0

This all looks like BS to me but its entertaining enough that I will likely read this entire thing. I'm curious to how I feel after reading it. 

>The Nazis were fascinated with Hollow Earth as well, and I don't believe they would have pursued it as much as they did if there was absolutely nothing to it.a) hollow earth was never party doctrine and never really a topic in the third reichb) even the party doctrine were often pretty bullshity - like dismissing relativistic physics because tehy were jewish..

From what I understand there is an 'embassy row' representing countries of the world there.

I think you're right, but I also think it's within the realm of possibility that there are remains of ancient.... something. 

There ain't no huge gravitational anomaly in antarctica.. maybe you are thinking about India? https://www.universetoday.com/116801/the-potsdam-gravity-potato-shows-earths-gravity-variations/

I consider myself pretty regular. All I did to explore Antarctica (and sail the north pole) was join the Coast Guard. Outside of the service, it isn't too difficult to get a job down there either. The work is seasonal which is a turn off for a lot of people. Very few crew winter over.And by all means fund yourself a private expedition. I would not consider tour lines exploration in any case.The opportunities are out there you just need to pursue them!

You caan fund the exploration yourself, you just get no aid getting to or from there 

To collect samples of "moon rocks"

>Ancient human settlements in Antartica seem quite plausible, if not probable.Except it's cold as shit, and you can't grow fuck-all there. I could maybe imagine an Inuit-like people living there living a subsistence-level existence eating marine life, but good luck erecting anything at all impressive without the surplus generated by agriculture.

wow. will be looking into this today. thanks for this.

I develop for Ethereum, the second largest crypto. AMA about the tech if you want.

He likely lived out his life in Argentina, or so the story goes.

what show is this

There is a Uboat that clearly dropped off Nazis in Argentina before surrendering. He may have been on that sub. Stuff They Dont Want You To Know did a podcast on this recently. 

> There is a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica and it is attributed to global warming.No it's not, it's attributed to the use of CFC's in aerosol and other applications. After CFC's were banned in the 80's the hole started closing immediately, though it's still thinnest down there. The ozone hole and global warming are two completely different issues.>Why is Operation Fishbowl not ever mentioned as the reason for the hole?I mean, Fishbowl was in the Northern hemisphere, and we have a pretty clear causal mechanism around CFC's that predicts that hole quite well. It's not really a mysterious thing.

Is shooting nukes off in the atmosphere good for 'Global Warming' ?

there was one called operation fishbowl too

How could anyone justify blowing off a nuke in space? Let alone the oceans like they did. I could see it being symbolic in a couple ways

>nuking the domeLOL

Dominic means of the lord. 

Operation "fishbowl" lol

Wouldn't it be easier to just file them as working for some normal domestic entity and obfuscating their travel logs?

Well, I've actually read both of those books you mentioned in your comment and in no way had related them to the current Antarctica conspiracies.Those are fiction. It is fact that there is a huge land mass under the Antarctic and it is a given that their will be something unusual under there. Be it gigantic ocean beast fossils or ancient civilisations - there will be something truly amazing underneath 10,000 years of ice. It is nonsense to say otherwise, i just hope the secrets are out before i move on from this world.

Agreed. Looking forward to many more.

Not as esoteric as nephilim, but your comment reminded me of this story:[Forgot your concerns about CERN: NASA probes detect very low frequency bubble around the earth](https://gizadeathstar.com/2017/05/forget-concerns-cern-nasa-probes-detect-low-frequency-bubble-around-earth/)From the comments:>My guess is the Antarctic is where these large VLF transmission stations are located.>Scientists have just finished an enormous neutrino-detecting apparatus in Antarctica, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. With appropriate pre-planning, wouldn‚Äôt this installation make a dandy ‚Äòcover‚Äô for a huge VLF antenna, frozen into the ice?

Something I thought of regarding the island plato described as atlantis, found beyond the "straights of hercules". What if he was referring to the continents of north and south america being one side of the straight, and europe and africa being the other? Beyond that? Antarctica. Plato also says "in the days when the atlantic was more navigatable" more advanced ships maybe? And that atlantis was massive, greater than "all of libya and asia". I think he had a different definition of how big asia was but hey, that's still pretty big. Antarctica fits the description.

Antarctica tropical 13000 years ago? How do you figure? 

> Graham Hancock's extensive compilation of work identifying an ancient advanced civilization is impeccableExcept for the complete and total lack of genetic evidence in our DNA to indicate what he says happened actually happened.  The migration patters he puts forth simply don't show up when we do DNA analysis.

I just watched that yesterday and that would be pretty terrifying.

Totally fits, Operation Highjump was '46-47

To be honest, the seemingly random uptick in sci films is probably a direct correlation with the increase in quality of props and special effects.

Care to give summary?

Chile carved out a pie slice of Antarctica and claims it as their territory: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_Antarctic_TerritoryIncidentally, Chile is the UFO capitol of the world. 

Despite lack of documentation supporting the idea Antarctica must be a treasure trove of natural history.  All kinds of space debris including meteorites, asteroids, and even comets should be there.  Crap falls from the sky and is layered by the ice sheets indicating chronology of these events.  If you found a crashed UFO anywhere else you might assume there could be more of them in Antarctica, perhaps with preserved occupants.There was a wave of UFO sightings at scientific stations in Antarctica during '65On Tuesday, July 6, 1965, the Argentine Navy released the following statement to news media about the sightings:"The Navy garrison in the Argentinean Antarctica, Decepcion Island, observed on July 3 at 19:40 hours local time, a giant, lens-shaped flying object..." continued: http://www.nicap.org/docs/antarctica/650703rep.htmBTW, check out Deception Island with Google Earth. It looks like Captain Nemo's submarine base. "This island's harbor is the caldera of an active volcano, which seriously damaged local scientific stations in 1967 and 1969." (wikipedia). Someone posted a photo of their yacht anchored there under the caption Hot Water.

Exactly. Space Race 2.0. General power projection, Total Spectrum Dominance or wtf. CNN(Anthony Bourdain) just did a show there and it was ALL about painting it as an established, decidedly American outpost, run by savvy quirky American scientists just doin innocent sciency stuff and "roughing it" (with shipped in fresh produce and various other luxuries that are probably taxpayer funded). 

We start a kickstarter to fund a private expedition there. And/or we gain enough momentum to convince a semi-well known researcher/explorer to go there/fund it partly himself/herself.

Removed. Racist slur. 

 

so whats your point? what do those two gifs have to do with antarctica?

That's interesting. I didn't know that. 

*that don't do image mapping that would be available to the public.

Satellites do pass by Antactica, just not directly over the south pole.

If they've got real satellites up they the. Why havent they ever set up a live stream? This would settle the whole flat earth debate. Just have one satellite actually zoom in on a person live and show him from the ground and space. There are NO SATELLITES. Editing Google Maps happens when they stitch together  a bunch of airplane / drone images to make it seem to be a sphere. NASA even admits that is how they generate composites for Earth.

Satellites don't exist.

I like to believe that not all that Lovecraft wrote was fiction.

So sad we aren't gonna see Cruise directed by Del Toro for the film

AGARTHA!!!

Just the amount of military presence raises a few eyebrows. Funny national geographic July copy is on giant Antarctica creatures. definitely not what we were told it is... I read a crazy book called "worlds beyond the poles" and not to mention General Byrd interview about his findings.

Thanks! I have a lot more from Nevada, California and Russia. 

It would be nice if op posted their coordinates too.

Are they tanks? I thought they were some kind of plough or something. The part that extends off is T shaped. I've not seen any tanks with T shaped cannons.

Bottom left corner.

tldrWeird people have been visiting Antarctica under even weirder circumstances as of late:John Kerry (at the height of the 2016 POTUS election), Buzz Aldrin (who was evacuated), Russian Orthodox Patriarch of Moscow Kirill III...etc.Also, there *may* be something to a post-WWII Nazi presence in Antarctica.Wild stuff.

I'd rather not endure his face.. Any good stuff?

Awesome response...thank you for demonstrating why these round tables kick ass.>That being said, we need to let go of the Piri Reis map as the golden idol of evidence on this matter. I agree completely and only referenced this because it's one of the first widespread "conspiracy theories" regarding Antarctica (along with Operation Highjump).One of my favorite books on this subject is called *Axis of the World: The Search for the Oldest American Civilization* by Igor Witkowski if anyone is interested in alternative histories.I'm eagerly looking forward to when the true history of the last 10,000 years or so is completely rewritten.

>before the cataclysmic end of the last ice age around 12,000 year ago (10,000 BC)I hate to be pedantic, but I feel it needs to be noted that we are still in the current  and fifth known ice age, [the Quaternary glaciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation). Ice ages proper are periods lasting millions of years and characterized by glacial ice sheets in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Each long-term ice age generally goes through periods of relatively colder or warmer climates, called glacials and interglacials respectively. Glacial periods are referred to popularly as "ice ages," hence some of the confusion. The last glacial (the Pleistocene) ended ~12,000 years, giving way to our current interglacial period (the Holocene). We're still in the ice age. 

 

Maybe they're prepping for harsh global warmer by prepping the colder parts for prime habitation?Also, I used to have a fascination with maps from that period, and they are all inaccurate, especially so in the remote inhospitable areas.

> I also accept that the ruling class of our current iteration of civilization are keeping this knowledge from us due to the grand implications of such ancient knowledge. Why do you think they're trying so hard to keep this information from us? I've often wondered about this. 

> I also accept that the ruling class of our current iteration of civilization are keeping this knowledge from us due to the grand implications of such ancient knowledge. Could you elaborate what "grand implications" could possibly be?  Whether it was once a thriving continent or it was always a cold wasteland, it's certainly the latter now without question.  What could be gained by having said ancient knowledge, let alone withholding it?

>  I also accept that the ruling class of our current iteration of civilization are keeping this knowledge from us due to the grand implications of such ancient knowledge.What implications?

I've heard that highschools, at least in my country, are teaching that the earth is expanding.

Ive literally never read anything about expanding earth theory but the gist of it sounds plausible to me tbh. The universe is ever expanding so it stands to reason that everything contained within the universe would follow suit

Very into it. And the Growing Earth concept ties into the Great Year -- higher energy = higher consciousness = more planetary/solar growth. (Explains why all the ancient cities and monuments are constructed using morter-less, polygonal block constructions -- with the Earth growing at its maximum rate, violent earthquakes were a common occurrence!)I didn't mention Growing Earth here, as the comment was long enough already, but it's very relevant:https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6m7l7b/rconspiracy_round_table_2_antarctica/dk0khfz/

Why would that be so?

And the USAF.

Whoops, sorry... He merely provided the forward to Hapgood's book on crustal displacement theory: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_shift_hypothesis)

IIRC humans have been in approximately modern form for around 300,000 years. It doesn't really seem all that likely that we never bothered organising ourselves for the first 280,000 years. It seems logical that we would have established societies, probably many different ones, over the millenia. How advanced though... that's another question. I'm not sure I buy much into the idea that they were heavily advanced. [This](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/265/5180/1841/tab-pdf) article describes evidence of extensive lead and silver mining/smelting during the Roman era, which I found interesting because I didn't really expect it that early.The authors state that they couldn't analyse a period of time (which in their sample was between 3,500 - 7000 years ago) because the core sample was brittle ice, which prevents measurement of heavy metals. Which naturally leads to what I assume would be other ice-core problems: the pollution needs to be widespread enough for the metals to reach areas where ice is fairly permanent and enough snowfall needs to occur to seal it in (if ice melts, pressumably a lot of the metals would run off with it. The geographic centers of prehistory cultures would likely be a lot of different to todays because of the differences in climate and sea level, which is (IMO) the biggest issue. If a culture was present at a time when the climate was colder, they would likely not have been in Europe, probably more likely to be as close to the equator as possible, which means any industrialised pollution (unless of a huge scale) wasn't likely to make it to the Artic or Antartica. Sure if would have been trapped in some ice, but that would have melted off as the planet warmed. Even in the case of the pollutants reaching the surviving ice regions, it'd have travelled a huge distance and be pretty dispersed reducing its detectability further.Sea level would have been much, much lower (100 - 200 metres lower). Human societies seem to thrive best when closer to the ocean. The ocean provides food, fresh water runs down through rivers to it, trade is easier etc. The crux of this issue though is the same facing us right now: we built all our best shit right next to the water because of the economic and agricultural benefits. Even 20,000 years ago the sea level was approx 120m lower than it is today. If early human cultures did the same as what we all did, then chances are all the evidence we would need to see has been underwater for tens of thousands of years. Hell, if there was a culture around 140-160k years ago, it would have spent a good 120k years underwater, come back out as another ice age hit, and then be submerged again. Assuming *anything* of those settlements survived the erosion they'd be encased under thousands of years of sediment.So really... on such long time scales I'm not sure that evidence of existence would have been discovered at this point. 

What kind of evidence do you think would prove their existence? Are you talking about physical archeological evidence or data from the ice cores suggesting a sort of industrial revolution 13,000 years ago? The latter would be very difficult to detect. Or maybe there was an intelligent highly technological civilization that didn't alter the atmosphere like we do today. 

If you would please specify what exactly it is you mean by remnant and I would gladly theorize more for you.

I, like a few others, don't really understand your question.  What would ice cores tell us about a previous civilisation? If you mean in terms of emissions and such, previous civilisation did not use a lot of the technologies we have today that create these pollutions. So an ice core sample isn't going to show any evidence of human civilisation or settlement because that's not really the sort of information an 'ice core' stores. 

Excellent research! Thank you!Did you see the latest bit of Meme Magic? Published in 1893, *[Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Adventures](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6n72io/this_book_was_written_in_1893_where_a_baron_trump)* is a story narrated by "Don Fum" ("Drumpf?") about Baron Trump's journey to Hollow Earth via an entrance in Russia.I'm convinced there is *something* to this theory.

iirc reasoning to not fly directly over the poles is because its longer than flying around, plus I imagine if theirs a disaster it would be harder to recover them from deeper in than on the edges. 

Good point but inner earth could equally be a psyop to deflect from flat earth. But factis both could co-exist as indeed could globe earth with inner earth of course. But antarctica is key in both inner and flat earth

> dismissing relativistic physics because tehy were jewish..No, im pretty sure it was because relativistic physics makes no intuitive sense; rather, the reality and philosophical claims which spawn from the math have never been proven; just theorized from sound mathematically models.  But yes, I can hear you already!  At some point we may need to abandon our intuition favor of data.  But there is no data on the relativistic claims.  At least in the sense of its quite outstanding claims on whats *really* happening to moving matter:   1) shrinking length in its moving frame (has "the pole in barn paradox" *actually* been verified)  2) gaining mass in its moving frame (example, compress a spring and it gains mass)  3) time slowing in its moving frame (more reasonable is that some subset or all of matter's processes slows because its interacting with an environment) - (Has the travelling twins paradox actually been observed, or just radioactive particles falling through our atmosphere?)Simplified yes, but all emerges from relativistic physics.  Yes? (Correct me please if im mistaken)So yea, im pretty sure its just a theory, and regardless of the scientism propaganda, one would be pretty wise to not accept it as fact.  The math is fine, I can personally attest to that.  Remember the map isnt the territory...

Got a source on that? I'd like to explore further.

After you get special permission to go there of course and notify the government exactly where you're going to be.

It wasn't always cold down there.

Well that's just damned interesting to find you here.

That's a way less exciting theory

Peter Levenda seems to think that Hitler originally landed in Argentina, but then fled for Indonesia due to the likelihood of being ratted out by former Nazis.See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFcBh6fF85g

Iirc it's just called conspiracy 

No, I think that's one of the reasons we don't allow it anymore, I think? I might be wrong but I think there's some kind of UN agreement. That and underwater I think

I forget if it was Carl Sagan, or someone of the like, who said that space is the only environment win which the power of a nuclear explosion can be harnessed creatively instead of destructively. This is due to the expansiveness of space and the abundance of its resources. Anyone remember this quote?

Right. The military knew what they were doing. Operation Fishbowl was named because we are under an impenetrable force field. Doesn't matter what shape Earth is. Nothing can leave the Fishbowl without the permission of God. Sorry space nerds. I use to want to be rocket ranger as well. 

So you aren't familiar with the Antarctic UFO base conspiracy? You either didn't read the Matt Reilly book or you have difficulty connecting the novels premise to the Antarctic UFO conspiracy. I stand by my theory that most people "Want to Believe" and will grasp any mainstream conspiracy to confirm their wild imagination. By the way, there are several other authors who have written about secret UFo bases on the continent. 

What is the point of this Very Low Frequency antenna? Why is there a "bubble" around the earth made of a VLF? What does that mean and what does that do? Prevent us from receiving something?

Got me thinking - Using a blast or melting method to form a gigantic Arecibo style radio dish in the ice is a fantastic idea. 

> My guess is the Antarctic is where these large VLF transmission stations are located*The United States Navy utilized extremely low frequencies (ELFs) as radio band and radio communications. The Submarine Integrated Antenna System (SIAS) was a research and development effort to communicate with submerged submarines.[22] The Soviet/Russian Navy also utilized ELFs for submarine communications system, ZEVS.[23] The Indian Navy has an operational ELF communication facility at the INS Kattabomman naval base to communicate with its Arihant class and Akula class submarines*The various military ELF facilities are located in the countries that have them which include the US, Soviet Union, and India.

What if the entire population died out? Even with 10,000 survivors, those genes would be completely diluted today thousands of years later.

Man would i love to do that shit

No

I actually don't believe that anything fell. Supposedly they've been tracking it for some time, yet there is no footage of this giant chunk of ice sliding off. You'd think they'd want to get video of that.

The "Poles" are real, dynamic places  and there is, actually, a toroidal vortex going in-and-out of the Planet there.

There are videos from the ISS which show the obvious revolution around the Earth

You don't exist

You can literally see them with the naked eye.

#HotTaek

My entire career in the military involved satellites and equipment needing them as sources for timing and location.  Granted the technology exists where computers tell you were they are, but we also have back up measures like slide rulers with coordinates to determine exactly where in orbit they are located.  There's a bunch of them out there, some only seperated by a few degrees if looking from earth (line of sight). We can shoot a telecom link full of info (up to gb of data) up to the satellite, and see it returned to us, processed by the satellite's equipment.  Little bit of info.  Most communication/GPS satellites have a 725mhz beacon beam thats always being transmitted (unencrypted)  which we tune our equipment too in order to align our antennas so that we can achieve the best signal to noise ratio.

Yeah that would have been pretty cool.In spite of the enthusiasm of the talent, it is a REALLY hard sale to get a studio to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a property they could never really own. 

Please let us see, when you have time.

The 2nd half of the images have coordinates at the bottom right i believe.

Not saying they're tanks, but that seems like an unnecessarily large number of ploughs to me.

T shaped bullets do almost double the damage of "l" shaped ones, which of course do 20x the damage of a bullet bullet. It's science.

Rumors out there Adm. Byrd went down there to investigate/explore and ran into them. 

Do any of those sources talk about the Ark of Gabriel possibly being transported down there, by any chance?

I think it's more likely it has something to do with oil/natural resource deposits being discovered, or the C-larson ice-shelf rupturing. 

The dude spelled it wrong. You want:https://www.reddit.com/r/AntarcticAnomalies/

If I say please will you let me in...

It's private. 

Thank you.

Not really. It was only broadcasted on the Mcmurdo cctv though and it only got out because someone at the station recorded it and uploaded it. He does mention that there really is no evidence of man made global warming though. He says that they are there to fond the evidence.

>I'm eagerly looking forward to when the true history of the last 10,000 years or so is completely rewritten.You mean revealed. It has already been extensively rewritten :-)

Geology ftw

Fascinating. Imagine the treasure trove of fossils. Maybe even frozen ancient animals and plants. 

Source? Why would there be coal if the trees are silicon based?

By "silicon-based world trees", I'm assuming you mean something like this?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HSL_u4jTLo(Although I think the Flat Earth part is disinfo.) The giant trees fit in well with the Growing Earth theory -- lower gravity means taller trees (and giant skeletons and megalithic structures). And look where Antarctica was, compared to the South Pole, 65 million years ago -- it was damn near equatorial!https://youtu.be/oJfBSc6e7QQ?t=1m38sI'd love to hear more about your ideas on Antarctica and history. Lurking your user history is a dead end. ;)

Heh, this corresponds with my believe that a celestial object passed by earth, pressing out magnetic field and our atmosphere in, lie a bubble, but it didn't pop, but what was exposed to the vaccum of space flash froze, and things not bolted down, who knows what the fuck happened to them. 

They cant predict the weather next week, what makes you think they can predict "harsher warming" when the current warming data has been proven to be falsified through "data temperature adjustments"

The apex of wealth and power leaves those wanting only more power. Things that encourage equality: free energy, education where one learns to think instead of memorize and conform, peace, etc are not things that ultimately grant you a net increase in power at that stage. 

Knowledge is power.

Shills don't want this information getting out. #anon5 FTW

I've heard the theory that there are frozen structures and relics there that would completely rewrite our history. Evidence of a prehistoric society that reached or exceeded our current technological level

This theory is HUGE expansion.  Pangea was basically like the skin on a tennis ball.  Water beneath the land increased the earth's diameter and the continent broke apart.  Oceans kept growing, diameter kept increasing, space between continents grew.My stopping point is, where did all the water generate from?  Has to come from somewhere.  Or maybe I understand the theory wrong,

What country are you from, friend?edit: spelling

The ice age ended ~11,700 years ago and we've been generally warming since then (with some cold/warm blips). 10,000 ago was right at the beginning of this warming trend. Antarctica had even more ice than it does today. 

Hmm... didn't know that actually.  Thanks for the reminder.  1947 was a busy year huh?

> The latter would be very difficult to detect. No it would not.  Chemicals and such not found in nature haven't been detected in ice cores from before the time of humanity and have been detected since.> Or maybe there was an intelligent highly technological civilization that didn't alter the atmosphere like we do today. They would have had to have mined which would have left traces they would have also have had to have rose to that level which would have left lots of traces.

Increased levels of materials and chemicals not found in nature.  Such traces can be detected today and have not been detected in any ice cores before the time of humanity.

Actuall flying on a polar route from say London to Tokyo would be quicker than flying out East. I am a travel agent and years ago I took an IATA exam for flight routings and pricing etc. The PO polar route was always cheaper and quicker than the EH eastern hemisphere. A lot of airline fares were calculated on that and sold on that basis. Whether they flew it or not I dont know. But food for thought

Yup, I've been contemplating all the scenarios, even watched a really out there vid of this dude who combined flat / inner earth, claims we're living under a dome that's surrounded by water, not space, and that the stars / planets are luminescent objects floating in this massive body of water our planet is submerged in. Not recommending this at all for info, but just to get a taste for some bizarre speculations that are out there:https://youtu.be/Cqi48CJGwGsI'll honestly say, that the more I look into it, the more cognitive dissonance forms in my mind. It would be nice to believe in something fully, but there's always the possibility that it's all a psy-op, injected into our mass truth seeking consciousness, having us endlessly discuss / divide back and forth. I'm convinced that the only way we can get real information (other than psychic means), is through actual clearance / raw intelligence cables, but that probably won't be happening any time soon. There are mythological connections pointing to inner earth though, so that gives me hope that it's real.

>No, im pretty sure it was because relativistic physics makes no intuitive sense; rather, the reality and philosophical claims which spawn from the math have never been proven;Naw, you are pretty much completly wrong.. hmm, where to start?a) Every theory is just a model, a describtion of the world - therefore there won't ever be a complete proof of a theoryb) Before relativistic physics the leading theory was the aether theory which is even more unintuitive.c) relativistic physics were developed as an answer to experiments which showed the aether to be wrong - the most famous is the Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887, 30 years before the formulation of Einsteins relativity theories. d) This theory holds up excellent in the macroscopic world - there is almost no doubt that it holds "true" (or at least far better than the aether theory).The offical wording in the 3rd Reich was actually "jewish physics" even tough the best german physicists were all relativistic physicists..I won't answer to your questions unless you really want to know because everything you wrote points to factthat you didn't even bothered to spend and hour reading about physics before being so pretty sure..

You dont need permission for the south pole

True but as long as it was at the south pole it was cold as shit, and the timescale of plate tectonics is millions of years, not thousands.  We're talking dinosaur times. The place was thoroughly frozen millions of years  before even the earliest primates appeared. 

I enjoy reading here. I don't necessarily buy in to any of it but it's all fascinating and it's always good to read some different opinions Ask away if you want :) I love talking about cryptos

Just because he probably escaped to Argentina doesn't mean they didn't have possible bases there.This is fairly fringe but I found this resource to be fairly interesting.http://thewebmatrix.net/disclosure/It goes into some of the Antarctic ideas

Coincidering there's credible documentation to assume Hitler did flee to Argentina and Argentina being one of the easier places to reach Antarctica, I'dd say the 2 (Hitler fled to Argenatina/Hitler fled to Antarctica) are pretty much synonymous, or atleast for the conspiracy-part of me. (I'll **settle** with just Argentina for now, and just theorycraft the rest)The Russians also [told us there's alot of things our governments -NATO- didn't tell us.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwUpPwyyvLw)Everything combined, I find it very fascinating, at the very least.

Maybe, but it certainly doesn't conflict with theories about Nazi survival in the Antarctic. 

There were a lot of detriments to nuking the atmosphere: blinding people, emp effects, killing animals. I think it also had an effect on the ozone layer, but dont quote me on that last one. 

Well your point is invalid because i have read the book - i did not jump to your wild conclusion and i don't think it is the reason others would have either.factthat 10,000 years of ice covers an area nearly twice the size of Australia...There is something fucking amazing that surely was a part of our ancestors lives underneath all of that ice. Most likely ancient civilisations - you are speaking of fringe theorists when you speak of a secret UFO base.

Not true. You dont need military permission. I read the Antarctic treaty.

How do you figure?

None of us do.  This isn't real.  This is a simulation.  We never existed, we never will.  We are simply instantiated, we are a product of software.lol

No, you can't. You can see the ISS drone ship on certain occasions, I'll give you that.

Then you must understand that all our "satellite" communications are a network of undersea cables, high altitude weather balloons and submarines.

I'll have to make a separate post. I want to organize and make descriptions for them. I appreciate the support.

Buzz Aldrin co-authored a book with this plot: [Evidence is found of an intelligent alien species who visited the Earth long ago and left an encyclopedia with the collected knowledge of their culture. The story is told from the point of view of a human historian on a star ship on the way to Alpha Centauri \(the aliens' home star\) who is using the time in transit to translate two alien books and to write a history of how humans gained access to the aliens' knowledge.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encounter_with_Tiber)

There was LOTS of ark of Gabriel talk around the time of the Kirill visit.  What do you know about it?There was something about it found in I believe Saudi Arabia, and transported in Russian ships due to it having killed people during extraction.That data?

One of my best friends uncles owns a few coal mines. All over the world. I lived with him in Vancouver for 6 months once and he told me his company funded a research trip to Antarctica to look for coal. They found heaps down there but the quality of the coal and the difficulty of extraction made it not financially viable to mine. He was telling me the rules there are so strict his team was given a specific diet because you cant bring your own food there, weighed upon arrival, told to shit in a bag for the duration of the expedition and then weighed when they left and they get fines if they leave any poop behind.

Thank you. Mobile phones are a bitch.

No it's not.

I dont know about elsewhere, but winter in Michigan has been weak for several years now, most of tge last decade. Arent there mucho icecap meltage going on, already drastically reduced?

> where did all the water generate from?My understanding: From aether, prana, proto-matter that fills up all the "empty space" around us and accounts for all the missing "dark matter". It's just an electron and a positron in a bonded pair, but because there's no net charge, it's undetectable to instrumentations. Under certain conditions in a strong magnetic field, it can be busted apart and form a hydrogen atom, helium atom, or heavier elements such as nitrogen, oxygen... Put hydrogen and oxygen together and you get water.That's why, IMO, the theory has been suppressed for so long. It essentially tells us water is renewable, oil is renewable, and "free energy" is a real thing.

in the bible, it is stated that during the Flood, huge fountains opened up from the ground and water poured forth. so it shows that rainfall wasn't the only contributing factor to the global flood. And if you're into hollow earth theory, the water could have been from the oceans inside the earth. Interesting enough, Jules Verne's *Journey to the Center of the Earth* also had these huge oceans inside the earth.

I've heard that there are huge ocean sized water reserves under plates.

Great questions.

Canada.

September 18th 1947, the USAF was formed, split off from the US Army when the National Security Act was signed by Truman. Lots of things were created that year.Interestingly enough to me. Most patents tied to our computerization and data storage can be traced and linked back to the companies owned or tied to people involved with Roswell and the beginnings of the USAF.

I would argue that there may easily have been a pre-historic ancient civilization, (similar to the one that existed in ancient Greece during it's Golden Age), that could have been based strictly on intellectual development and the acquisition of knowledge **strictly for it's own sake** without applying it for any form of material gain or advantage over nature or others; or the pursuit of technological conveniences or the crass commercialization of such developments simply for private profit.In our own world at this juncture knowledge is *only* pursued and sought out strictly for those reasons or explained and taught strictly in terms of them. In short any pursuit of knowledge *strictly for it's own sake* or to elevate our minds and extend our powers of thought to a higher level isn't a goal that is even recognised nor are any of the possibilities that kind of a focus and dedication might reveal and provide in terms of "mind over matter".The Greek Parthenon sits upon a single piece of rock, four feet thick, that's half the size of a football field. Despite the ancient Greeks predilection for geometric perfection the building that sits upon it with an overpowering sense of perfection to it, is anything but "perfect". It is, in fact, almost three feet higher on one side than it is on the other and the rows of columns that support the roof are all subtly altered not simply in their height but from what would also have been a perfect alignment and distribution. Had they done so, however, the building would have been technically perfect but it wouldn't have "looked perfect" due to parallax and other optical disturbances that would have occurred if they had. It's impossible to say how they could possibly have known all that in advance without building a technically perfect one and then taking it all apart and re-building it so as to make "look perfect", instead, yet there is no indication that they did anything but directly and deliberately construct it "precisely" the way it is. Moreover there is a far higher degree of knowledge and precision in the way it was subtly altered to be that way than if all the measurements had been as precise and equal as they visually appear to be without actually being that way at all. There are similar instances with some of the most beautiful statues of the human form that were created in the same period that aren't, in fact, anatomically correct, either, but derive their overall sense of perfection and beauty from the addition of muscles humans quite simply don't have. I suggest you think about the kind of mental and intellectual focus on the "ideal" and rendering it's sense of perfection by avoiding the pitfalls and limitations of adhering to what would constitute a form of physical and technical perfection that would nevertheless fail to actually give any real impression or sensation of actually being a perfect form of any kind. A mental ability to capture the "inspiration" and translate that as precisely as possible and the power it has to genuinely uplift the mind and spirit. An altogether noble and entirely human ambition that has been lost to antiquity.

Let's say this was an Ancient Rome level of civilization 13,000 years ago, not a post-industrial level civilization . That would be impossible to detect chemically in ice core samples. 

I'll admit that is very true, however I would suggest that they may have found an alternate source of energy that we haven't unlocked which doesn't require unnatural radioactive isotopes as you suggest.

Once you start going down the psy op is pay op route, it never ends...maybe that is a psy op...

Yep I agree with what you are saying. There is a lot of noise which just serves to distract everyone. I dont know either way to be honest with you but have read a lot about both and think both could be possible. What we need is a revolution and we take over the map rooms ;)

And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.   Genesis 1:7

Interesting response.You completely missed my point, especially considering "youre completely wrong"And, no, the aether concept is not unintuitive (interwoven "space-time" is about the most unintuitive it gets) nor has all potential aether theories been disproven, not by Michelson and Morley or any other.  If you think so, please lay out your case instead of parroting things you heard elsewhere.  (Just be sure you first know all of the viable aether theories)> This theory holds up excellent in the macroscopic worldNo, im positive we've never proven the three bullet points (essentially length contraction, mass and time dilation) I enumerated.  Just blind faith assumptions that the helpful relativistic math is reality.  **In other words, is time actually slowing in the muons reference frame, or is its atomic processes (decay) being affected by the environment?** You think the scientists know?And ive officially studied modern physics (which included relativity) in school and on my own time.  Whats your experience with relativity?---The only thing you may be right about is nazis mentioning Jewish physics.  Regardless, the nazis had plenty a reason to not take the claims as reality, just as I lay out here.  It makes more sense this is how the blaspheme started and it got watered down to "Jewish physics" (kinda how most people know very little about anything, yet are nasty and opinionated, yet sometimes right without knowing why) but I may be wrong.  Havent looked into nazi german physicists rebuttals.

Ok, yeah. You are correct that it was frozen unless we're going back millions of years. The number I keep seeing is 12000 years ago, so should be frozen. 

You might be best able to answer this... Would it be worth it to mine Ethereum on a couple of PCs I have? Or is it not really worth my time anymore?Thanks in advance!

I care less about nazi military bases there if Hitler didn't escape to them tbh

I love factthat that documentary is from the perspective of the Russians. It's always interesting to get another take on the matter from a culture outside of the dominant western/US perspective.

[Quick link to NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mms/index.html) or Google-image "Van Allen Belts" illustrate the invisible fields entering/exiting the Poles.

It's true, the character I is a figment of your imagination. You desperately want to believe you're real because it gives you a sense of purpose. Not to mention all the time you've invested in creating your persona. Something like that is hard to let go of.

 

Wow not to take away the seriousness of your post but that sounds like it would be a good video game

Reminds me of the plot of hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy 

This one worked for some reason. Idk what was going on. Also, thanks guys there's so much on that sub to dig through!

Was for me 

I'd like to read about these silicon trees.

I'd be happy to meet you over at steemit.com Maybe it's the kick in the pants I need to leave this ghetto.

Yep it has been pretty weak in the south of the uk too. Can't remember the last time we saw real snow that hung around for days

How have your summers been over there?  I have an uncle by marriage that is very redhead, very fair skin.  10 years ago the joke was how he would use half a bottle of SPF110 to goto outdoors.  Last summer and this one he doesn't use sunblock but once or twice, and he says he goes fishing and swimming atleast 2-4 times a week for a few hours each session.  Said going outside is a pleasure now vs being almost albino vampire.TL;DR: your sun index more gentle this year and last vs previous years?  Don't burn as easy?

I suppose there was atleast one point where Moses generated water by hitting a rock with his staff - and water poured out.The oceans inside the earth seem hard to believe for me, unsure why.  The pressure, the heat - but guess I am not being open minded enough to consider that possibility.

Wow. Really? Wow. That makes me happy.

>It's impossible to say how they could possibly have known all that in advance without building a technically perfect one and then taking it all apart and re-building it so as to make "look perfect", instead, yet there is no indication that they did anything but directly and deliberately construct it "precisely" the way it is. It's almost as if they could "draw" or "plan" in advance.  I mean we can do that, but impossible that they could have.....right?

Should also mention technological advances in Eastern ancient civilizations such as Ancient China. There are artifacts found such as swords and armor where modern techniques aren't able to replicate how they forged such items. As well as pyramid-like structures also found all over the place in Western China. There are some tombs made of material in which archeologists can't break into despite even using explosives.

If it left no traces, why suppose it existed?

If no proof, then why suppose as such?

Hahaha, indeed, you have to ultimately go with your intuition, which tells me that there's something to inner earth, and flat earth is the distraction.

My problem with quotes like that, is they can be interpreted in so many ways, to fit a particular belief system. The firmament can mean something other than a dome.

>And, no, the aether concept is not unintuitive nor has all potential aether theories been disproven, not by Michelson and Morley or any other. If you think so, please lay out your case instead of parroting things you heard elsewhere. (Just be sure you first know all of the viable aether theories)The goal is always to find a model with the least amount of unknown variables and while you could probably find a equivalent aether theory you would still have to argue which you introduce a friggin new medium at all.To fit results from eg. the gravity probe B into any aether model would be far less elegant and *intuitive* than the spacetime concept of relativistic physics. >No, im positive we've never proven the three bullet points (essentially length contraction, mass and time dilation) I enumerated. Just blind faith assumptions that the helpful relativistic math is reality. First of all: As long as a model holds up the assumption that it will hold up was true. There is no need to move away from relativistic physics because it explains the behavior of the universe better than any other model we have. If you have a better model share it. Second point is a variation of the first: Reality is just that. Reality. But that won't help actually decribing the universe. Are Newtons gravitational laws actually true? Who knows, but things fall down on a pretty regular basis so probably yes. No scientist, no human *knows* they *assume* and in the best of cases they actual have a rational argument to back their assumption. Space distortion is so far backed by the experiments, time dilation as well (e.g. H√§sches experiment in Germany).>And ive officially studied modern physics (which included relativity) in school and on my own time. Whats your experience with relativity?Undergrad in physics.

I don't mine Ether, personally, but as I understand you need a fairly intensive setup to make money against the electricity you're spending.Personally, I'd just go buy some :) Price is really low right now due to the crypto market dipping, and speculators cashing out, but Ethereum's technology hasn't changed. IMO, although I'm not a trader and don't know markets, we're looking at what is the very beginning of Ether's rise. A few years from now I think it'll be worth quite a bit more than it is today.

me too, hope you share :)

>sounds like it would be a good video gamewelcome to our actual reality ;)

Metal Gear Solid is not just a videogame either

Where abouts in the south are you? Just curious as I'm in the south also.

No problem, doesn't hurt to look into it. ;)

I've got news for you, we don't predict and don't calculate for any purely optical effects that might result from making any architectural structure as precisely as we can which is why many modern buildings are less impressive than they were intended to be or appeared as if they would be on drawings and scale models. In fact we have a difficult enough time simply trying to build them as planned, as any architect can tell you.We can't even build an ordinary house 50' long without it being out of alignment by at least a few inches and having to jigger the roof to compensate for all of the corners being out of whack by at least that much. The Great Pyramid of Egypt by comparison is out by far less than a quarter of an inch across any of the four corners of it's incredibly immense base. That was discovered and confirmed by using a laser transit to measure them and the angles they form which means the that whoever built that huge pyramid had some way to not only measure them with that same laser-like degree of accuracy but to actually execute and build it just as precisely which is something we still can't do. All modern buildings, no matter how much effort is put into making them as precisely and accurately as possible are always out of alignment and the bigger they are the greater the discrepancies that eventually result. They aren't noticeable due to the scale but many large office towers and major structures are out as much as a foot or two from corner to corner and that certainly isn't planned but it is generally anticipated because it's just that likely that it will invariably be out of line to some extent. You merely *assume* and  *think* that we must be as capable or more capable than some ancient humans and the remarkable precision of measurement or execution some of their artifacts bear witness to but we quite simply aren't, nor do we actually expect that from any of our own endeavours. We seek neither perfection nor any appearance of it and if we achieve anything close to it it's invariably accidental. We strive only for that which is "good enough" or "nice enough" for our purposes, and those purposes have nothing to do with reflecting any form of "perfection" that we either have or seek to express as actually being the primary goal in creating any of them. Now you can't predict the view from any approach to the Parthenon that necessitated making one side of it three feet higher in order to have it appear perfectly perched on the heights above the city except by being at and observing it from all of those numerous approaches and locations; or the spread and positioning of all of the interior columns that hold up the roof to correct for the parallax effect a technically perfect arrangement and alignment of equally sized and spaced columns would have had on the human eye, not just from one, but from looking from any position across, through, upward, and beyond from anywhere *inside* of the actual building itself. That is no small accomplishment, I can assure you.You would quite literally need a model you could walk around inside of in order to do that. Like I said you would have to actually build it to size in order to correct for the all the various optical distortions that all of the columns were subtly and "perfectly" adjusted to compensate for. It's not simply a building, but a rather unique and profound "work of art" of the highest order and an extremely important one, at that. Moreover, it was built by "Idealists" in pursuit of the most "Ideal" form to express that ambition, not the cold, calculating, hard core "realists" seeking to run our own society and world that neither have nor want anything whatsoever to do with that.

Source? Can't imagine anything diamond tips or thermite can't get through. You can't cheat the mohs hardness scale or thermodynamics.

Why suppose it didn't?

Well for starters, I've never been to Antarctica to see it for myself, have you?

Perhaps we are getting somewhere...> To fit results from eg. the gravity probe B into any aether model would be far less elegant and intuitive than the spacetime concept of relativistic physics.Says which scientists?  And/Or you?> First of all: As long as a model holds up the assumption that it will hold up was true. There is no need to move away from relativistic physics because it explains the behavior of the universe better than any other model we have. If you have a better model share it.No!!!  I am not disagreeing with the math.  Me:> The math is fine, I can personally attest to that.  > Remember the map isnt the territory...Read it!  Damn it, just read it!I'm arguing specifically that the math isn't reality.  There are multiple mathematical models that are correct in many domains.  Multiple ways to solve equations.  But when we finally start applying math to reality, there is really only one thing that is happening.  (Quantum physics is really quantum statistics, please though, let's save that for another time, until we sort the current issue at hand...)'Tis similar to the interpretation to what relativistic physics tells us.  In it's words.  In it's philosophy.   The theory beyond the math is what has and probably will always bother me if someone doesn't just go ahead and figure out how to built the tool that cheats the universes circuitry (measures the current unmeasurable aether)> while you could probably find a equivalent aether theoryYes, here you actually admit that just because the math is right, doesn't mean some other math might also be right but conflict in terms of how the reality machine really works.  > But that won't help actually decribing the universe.It's actually the next step beyond Math.  Describing the universe.  Especially if you still believe what you said just before (while you could probably find a equivalent aether theory.)  Since if that's true than why shouldnt we say aether theories reality model for the world is the right one.  It simply conflicts with relativistic interpretation (time dilation, length contraction etc are real phenomenon)> Space distortion is so far backed by the experiments, time dilation as well (e.g. H√§sches experiment in Germany).I actually have not heard of this and am looking into it now.  I get a bad feeling about this.  Would you be open to talk about potentially why this experiment doesn't actually do what you are saying it does?  Proving space distortion and time dilation, that is.  Because again, if you've read me, you would recall the muon.  Some say it proves time dilation as well.  But if you still believe that, you're sorely not comprehending what I'm explaining.

Started with types of queries on Google.  A H√§sches experiment in relativity  => A lot of results come up but no mention of Hasche.

Around zero delay, a pronounced coherent signal occurs with sign and amplitude depending on the spectral position within the probe pulses. The coherent coupling of the type electronic transitions is due to the coherent vibrational motion induced by an impulsive Raman-type excitation in the electronic ground state. The molecules promoted to Sn states give rise to a fast ground state bleaching on a 50 fs timescale that is followed by the picosecond onset of stimulated emission after accumulation of the excited molecules at the bottom of the S1 state.Is it this one you are talking about?  We just have the abstract (paywall) but 20 femptosecond is an awfully fast frequency.  Crazy stuff.  The thing is, it's in a chemistry journal or something of that sort.  Why wouldn't this explicitly mention that it was the first to "prove" some dilation is *really* happening?  A little help here?  And actually, you should update the Wikipedia page while you are at it!

What argument can you make to differentiate your product from competitors?

If i look back on my nerdy childhood with a gnostic perspective i find alot of messages about this knowledge in videogames.Story of the moon that creates a special gravity on earth deforming all creatures (morning of the magicians, horbiger theory of reality)? Final Fantasy 8, the lunar cry.Theory of godliness really being controlled by parasites that keep it up for their survival and gain? whole story of FF10.Alchemic theory? pretty much all final fantasy to 6, with a lot of hiddend hints at the occult here and there.Hell i even suppose on the long run this became an actual plot to hide ancient knowledge.Now if you simply google an ancient deity name, you get the wiki and then 10 pages on videogame's characters or pngs with that name. It's a pretty effective counter measure, and mostly unsuspectable.

Hastings. Very little snow here for a few years now

This topmind user who's beaking you obviously has no clue how special the great pyramid is. There's no machinery in the world that could get those stones to the upper portion, weighing over ten tons. Also, 2 sides of the pyramid when looked at from ABOVE on the summer and winter solstice, show a perfect indent, making the pyramid have more sides. So they also included cosmology into their build. 

Are you seriously suggesting that as a group humans are incapable of building or planning as accurately as the ancient Greeks or Egyptians?Do you think the Hoover dam was built to less tolerances than the Pyramids? Do you think a nuclear power station or CERN are built less precisely than the Parthenon?Just because we build some shit buildings along the lines of "that'll do" does not mean we are less capable than the ancient Egyptians or Greeks. I'd be surprised if the ancient Greeks or Egyptians could have built Notre Dame or Santa Maria del Fiore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_CathedralAnd they were built around the 1300's.  They are far more complex and precise than either the Pyramids or the Parthenon and yet were built without the aid of post industrial equipment.  It's nice to imagine that the ancients had some secret building knowledge, but they didn't.  Not to take anything away from them, what they did was remarkable, especially considering they were starting from first principles, but we have gone forward not back from them, standing on the shoulders of giants as it were. Maybe we have lost some of the beauty and majesty (I don't think we have, we just have to build more and quickly) but to suggest we are in some way incapable of producing something of equal complexity is flat out wrong, it was even wrong 900 years ago.>I've got news for you, we don't predict and don't calculate for any purely optical effects that might result from making any architectural structure as precisely as we canYou think this wasn't done deliberately for optical effect?http://www.raywhite.my/img/Marina%20Tower%20main01.jpg

If I may bring an example: Within classical physics something like a black hole was absolutely possible - simply a star with a gravitational pull large enough to recapture light. When Schwarzschild proposed black holes within relativistic physics Einstein was opposed to the idea and wouldn't accept it for quite some time. For the observer of a black hole the difference is pretty much negligible.>Some say it proves time dilation as well. But if you still believe that, you're sorely not comprehending what I'm explaining.Again: Something like an absolute proof will never be possible. But by now,.. could you tell me *which* part of relativistic physics irks you so much and why? What is it with space/time dilation that makes people so unhappy?

I looked into it.  See sibling comment

Dont forget ff4 and the hollow "fake" moon

Brighton, here. I can't even remember the last time snow actually set.

/u/JoeyBananas79 went hard as fuck in that post. I think I nutted a bit when he dropped that link

"It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."

This is what "irks" me most:No need at all to pronounce that matter is literally shrinking, mass is increasing and that time is slowing, all due to difference in relative velocity.Just acknowledgement the math seems to be a solid fit is good enough.  The philosophical implications of the math are not proven, just assumed as true (the above); and the model is naturally set up in such a way such that transforms ensure there is no mathematical contradictions.  'Paradoxes' can be resolved mathematically, but have never been shown to actually happen - ex: two humans (biological organisms) aging differently due to relative velocity/acceleration, yet its a common "textbook" example.If I understand your post, you may agree.  Thats my point, more succinctly.  I'll keep it short because id like to know your response directly to that.

Well it looks like some conspiracy fellow from the old times found a way to cash the knowledge in for good...Anyway good one, i forgot about that. To think of it, ff4 was really deep with hollow theories, the earth too.

Yes from my memory about 5 years ago

That's a good attempt to make you sound smart, but I don't think Aristotle was implying that every story someone comes up with should have time spent on it.  There is no trace of a pyramid in my garden, dismissing my neighbours claim that Egyptians once built one there does not mean I have an uneducated mind.  The opposite in fact.

>Thats my point, more succinctly. I'll keep it short because id like to know your response directly to that.My response is that time and mass always (well, till the mid/late 19th century and then again due to relativistic physics) have been relative. Using days to count time already means accepting a non-absolute time between two dates, if you weight the same rock at two different places on earth you will usually get a different weight. It was just for a relatively short time that we believed time to be absolute. Furthermore our concept of time, length and mass is quite arbitary - there may be some sort of absolute norm in the universe but why should it be something like the oscillations of a caesium atom?If we go a step ahead and take a look at (quantum) vacuum oscillations we again reach something like a aether-look-alike with the disturbing consequence than there may be no absolute vacuum. Honestly something like a relative time/length is far easier to accept for me than something like a sub-zero Kelvin temperature (https://www.mpg.de/research/negative-absolute-temperature) which turns around everything I learned about thermodynamics.Back to the twin paradox: Just take (chemical) reaction kinetics, where the speed of the reaction is a function of electronegativity, temperature, etc. Coming from this POV another variable like the relative speed of the system is nothing to freak out about. :) 

I especially like how the Lunarians come from a destroyed planet once in orbit between Jupiter and mars.  Or how Cecil and Goblez's father came from the "Red Moon" but was killed by the humans.Lots of great story spawned by theories of the time.

Gat damn, again! JoeyBananas79 you posting my exact thoughts 

I can respond in more detail but I think your whole post misses the premise of **space-time** linkage.  The claim is that moving in one reference frame affects time and space depending on the observers reference frame.  Your example about dates is irrelevant here, I dont see how the decisioms made behind calendar years, days whatever has to do with what "irks" me.  Explain more if youd like. Your example about gravity is beyond irrelevant, since obviously weight is variable.  But mass was not considered variable until "relativity".  Variable based on reference frame at least, and in a closed system.And finally, by using a chemical reaction as an example, you entirely ignored my premise about the muon and how its unreasonable (without evidence) to think that if it applies to the muons radioactivity then it must apply to human aging.  I don't have a problem with the word/concept "relative".  Plenty of things only have meaning when taken relative to something else.  My issue is in the reality interpretation of special relativity.Youre all over the place, it seems.

Kudos to whoever came up with these round tables, they're great.

There's a lot more interesting things about the moon's dimensions as well, much of which was known by ancient monument builders who made the pyramids at Giza as well as Stonehenge and many other sites.For example, the ratio of the Earth's diameter to the Moon's diameter is 11:3, or 7920:2160 miles. This ratio produces a phenomenon known to ancient geometers as squaring the circle. If you made a circle with a radius of the Earth's radius, plus the moon's radius, then that circle would have the same perimeter as a square drawn around the Earth:http://joedubs.com/squaring-the-circle/Basically, if the Moon were touching the Earth, then you could draw a circle with it's center at the center of the Earth, and it's edge passing through the center of the Moon, and that circle would have the same length around it's edge as a square perfectly enclosing the Earth. This relationship is illustrated in the great pyramid at Giza in the ratio of its height to its square base, and in the concentric rings at Stonehenge.This relationship would not be there if either the Earth or the Moon were a little bit bigger or smaller, and is even more amazing when you realize the significance of measuring these dimensions in miles. The ancient approximation of pi‚âà~~11/7~~ 22/7 is reflected in the radius of this large circle encompassing the Earth and the Moon with radius 5040 miles, or 7! (7x6x5x4x3x2x1) and the diameter of the Earth (or one side of the square) with length 7920 miles, or 11!/7! (11x10x9x8). So whoever came up with the measurement of the mile clearly had this relationship in mind.There's even more significance when you start to look deeper into the cosmic patterns of the universe, but the moon is just the start. Our ancient ancestors who designed not only the length of the mile, but also the foot, meter and cubit had these cosmic dimensions and ratios as their basis, as explained so well by Alan Greene, who recently did an AMA. True, the moon is amazing, but once you start to study the deeper patterns in the cosmos and the sacred geometry all around us in nature, it becomes clear that the moon is simply one of many amazing "coincidences" of proportion that seem too perfect not to be designed. My personal feeling is that the underlying structure of our universe itself is beautiful, fractal harmonic relationships, and as a result, everything in the manifest world reflects that.

I put this thread together for /r/conspiracy a few years back:[A Little List of Coincidence in the Solar System](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ugs5u/a_little_list_of_coincidence_in_the_solar_system/): Space, Geometry and the Golden Section. Do the planets hide a secret Harmony of the Spheres?

I love space related conspiracy. Great topic. 

Astronomer [Tom Van Flandern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Van_Flandern) and others have argued that there used to be a large planet between Jupiter and Mars (where the asteroid belt is today). Mainstream science doesn't entertain this possibility because there isn't a natural mechanism for the literal "explosion" of an entire planet.Van Flandern, undeterred, traced back the paths of scores of comets in our solar system, and discovered that many converged at the same time, and at the same location, at two points in the history of our solar system, with the most recent being approximately 2 million years ago. Other writers like Joseph P. Farrell (in his book *The Cosmic War*) offer a *technological* explanation for this major event, namely that this large, potentially earth-like object was *deliberately* destroyed, and even more hypothetically by a weaponized moon in our solar system.Van Flandern took it even further by speculating that "the origin of the human species may well have been on the planet Mars, which he believed was once a moon of a now-exploded "Planet V"."In support of this theory, some ancient cultures have lore that tells of ancient humans originating on Mars.If this interests anybody, I highly recommend reading *Dark Matter, Missing Planets & New Comets* by the late Van Flandern. He has an entirely new approach to gravity that honestly is quite stunning in its simplicity and implications.

The Hollow Phobos Hypothesis has significant evidence to back it up, which is a problem because, paraphrasing Carl Sagan, there isn't an accepted *natural* explanation for a hollow planetoid.[The Phobos Monolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_monolith) is also the subject of significant speculation.There has also been a curious history of failing equipment each time we get close to this enigmatic moon...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon)#Shklovsky.27s_.22Hollow_Phobos.22_hypothesis

One thing I often wondered about was the difference between the Earth's 24hr day and our biological 25hr clock (put people in a room containing no natural light nor clocks, and they will naturally have 25hr sleep/wake cycles.)  What if some time ago the earth had a 25hr day, and some astronomical event slowed it down.  That would explain why our clock is off.  But when did it happen, and was the moon involved?

The one that I find most interesting is John Brandenburg and the evidence for prehistoric global nuclear warfare on Mars.  [Death on Mars by John Brandenburg](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Mars-Discovery-Planetary-Massacre/dp/193914938X)[Gordon White interviews Brandenburg on the skeptiko podcast](http://skeptiko.com/john-brandenburg-outsourced-ufo-research-325/)  [The first sentence on the Brandenburg page at rationalwiki:](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/John_Brandenburg) John E. Brandenburg is a plasma physicist who went somewhat off the rails in 2012 and started proclaiming that he saw clear evidence of a thermonuclear war on Mars in the distant past.

Let's try to factor in those [moon "wave" anomalies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVm99ur5lg) in here also.  Because to me, it looks like a hologram that's refreshing or something.  And no, it's not the camera or an artifact, that's been debunked multiple times.

The Moon has 99% been a part of (or in the vicinity of) Earth since it's formation. The decay of the Helium isotopes matches up which means that the Helium atoms on Earth and the Helium atoms on the Moon have been close to each other since just about their formation. Another way of putting it is that both sets of Helium have experienced the same amount of time in the universe, which can only mean that they have travelled together. This is all pretty concrete and is the reason why the impact hypothesis is the currently accepted theory.UNLESS, the moon landings never happened and the "Moon Helium" is in fact terrestrial. 

Ah, classic /r/conspiracy. How much I have missed you and these threads. I love you guys. :) 

I don't believe this enormous 'tower' photographed by the Soviets in 1965 was ever explained https://www.reddit.com/r/UnexplainedPhotos/comments/47upry/the_mysterious_tower_on_the_far_side_of_the_moon/Is it a glimpse into the far side of the moon?

I just had a random thought, what if the total eclipse on August 21st will be used to implement some form of Project Blue Beam? EVERYONE will be looking at the sky in the states...

The secret is the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Look at Tethys and Minas's heat signatures, what does pacman eat? Ghosts.

Is it possible that because of the sheer size of everything, that there is a "zone" in which the moon could reside to give us the same eclipse effect?  I've heard astronomers describe it like if the moon were 100 miles nearer or further it wouldn't give the same effect.

Here's a conspiracy that will be hated. Maybe there is a god/creator of the universe. And this planet is perfectly designed to support life?

The moon is 400 times smaller than the sun while being 400 closer to the earth than the sun, giving us perfect solar eclipses. That's pretty convenient.

Here is something relevant I posted a couple weeks ago. **NASA VIDEO EVIDENCE of the astronauts faking shots of "Earth at a distance" during the Apollo missions, while they were still very much in low Earth orbit.**Because once you realize that we may have never passed LEO, questions about the moon become much more valid. Another angle of thought is that we went to the moon, found out something that was  too much to tell the public, so we filmed and faked an alternate moon reality (NASA's moon footage) and have been presenting that to the public ever since.______The following evidence represents an extremely important moment caught on camera that I believe has never been adequately addressed by NASA or any NASA supporter. In my opinion it is equivalent to what the ‚ÄúWTC7 collapsing‚Äù footage is to the 9/11 truth movement.It comes from the documentary ‚ÄúA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon‚Äù but I am not trying to convince anyone of anything from an obviously biased documentary. Be skeptical of all of it. I encourage that. When this clip plays in the documentary there is a narrator but, again, I am telling you to completely ignore that voiceover if it pleases you.Simply use your eyes and use your brain and look at what I am about to show you. I am purposely separating the most important footage from the documentary and its bias, muting the narrator, and breaking the clip up into very short digestible gifs. Lets start.Does this look like the Earth to you? Would you assume that this is a shot from the far reaches of space, looking back at Earth from a distance?http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-P6L-AaPretty convincing right? Lets look at more footage of ‚ÄúEarth at a distance‚Äù:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-2BRu4xZooming in the camera which we can only assume is pushed up against a shuttle window, pointed out at the Earth in the blackness of space:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-fnU3AeOkay, this shot is even better. Notice that you cannot really make out any continents? Notice that you see no stars? But for the sake of argument, lets just completely ignore that for now. Take a look:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-xaWNX2I mean, thats definitely the Earth right? And you would have to be far beyond Earth (on the way to the moon) to get footage like that, correct? Again, no recognizable continents, No stars. But again, for the sake of argument, lets allow science to explain that.But wait, how exactly does this happen? http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-TTDLgtWait, isn‚Äôt the camera pressed against the window and zoomed in? Because they are far from Earth right, at least this far, correct? If they zoomed that camera back out.http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-aRd5qGBut wait a minute, wtf is that? Is that the sun?http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-KRP8WaHold on. Wut? Here is a longer gif just to make the strangeness very clear.http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-pVgTUTIs that a‚Ä¶ work light? Of enormous size and floating in space?Wait a minute, whats going on? http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-0cFJWXReady to have your mind completely shattered? Look:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-H8tierSo wait, what? Yeah, that ‚ÄúEarth at a distance‚Äù was a clever camera trick. They used the circular shuttle window and the small part of the enormous Earth showing through that small circular window. Camera tricks and the illusion of a little ‚ÄúEarth ball‚Äù at a distance.As you can see here, they are very close to Earth. Like ‚ÄúLow Earth Orbit‚Äù close. And yes, that was a work light. You can now see it clearly. And that blackness was a darkened shuttle interior. Again:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-bXHv0J Or‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I am willing to entertain any ideas or thoughts on this.And let me set the record straight once and for all:Do you personally subscribe to any ‚ÄúFlat Earth‚Äù or ‚Äúalternate Earth models‚Äù?‚Äî NODo you believe in the ISS and Mars rover missions?‚Äî YESDo you believe that you can shine a laser at a retroreflector on the moon?‚Äî YES, because the unmanned soviet [Lunokhod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunokhod_programme) program left retroreflectors there.What about the other evidence: moon rocks, etc‚Ä¶?‚Äî I am not sure honestly, I do not feel like I have studied enough to make a decision.So what are you trying to prove then?‚Äî I am simply pointing out that there is unusual footage of what appears to be the astronauts filming a disingenuous ‚ÄúEarth‚Äù. I find the footage fascinating and would love to know more about it. I would love to see the unedited footage and I would love to see the extended footage.How do we know this is real NASA footage?‚Äî Because NASA included it in their Apollo 11 DVD set. Why, I don‚Äôt know. But people definitely thought that pointing that out would somehow make my brain stop comprehending what it saw.As a matter of fact, [here is a website that appears to be trying to debunk that footage](http://www.clavius.org/bibsibrel.html), scroll to the bottom.This is their explanation:_____What Mr. Sibrel supplies is footage of the astronauts practicing for an upcoming telecast. **Because television was added at the last minute, they hadn't had time to practice much with the equipment. So they were experimenting with different camera positions and exposure settings**. Someone on the ground recorded it. Mr. Sibrel notes several observations which he can't explain in terms of his expectations, therefore he concludes the astronauts "must" have been faking it. That's it. That's his "smoking gun."_____And finally, here is [the TIMESTAMPED section of ‚ÄúA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon‚Äù](https://youtu.be/xciCJfbTvE4?t=32m20s) if this post piqued your interest. Once again, take everything said by the narrator with a grain of salt. I am not trying to convince anyone of anything other than what their eyes see and the conclusions their brain reach while watching that particular footage that I made gifs from. I personally have a hard time wrapping my brain around what form of ‚Äúcontext‚Äù could possibly explain it. 

When the Earth was Moonless:http://www.halexandria.org/dward200.htm

The other day I was reading through this thread and someone linked to a story about NASA sending 2 secret Apollo missions to the moon who made contact and were murdered by an alien life form.But now I can't find it. Anyone help me out with a link?

Does anyone know for what purpose would people lie about the Earth being round?  I look at a lot of conspiracy theories but the flat Earth one kind of shows how easily it is to convince people of whatever you want.

Here's Richard Hoagland's article on Saturn's moon Iapetus:[A Moon with a View](http://enterprisemission.com/moon1.htm)Other researchers [have pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/246tud/you_can_relax_now_that_mysterious_equatorial/) that the massive and mysterious "equatorial ridge" around Iapetus has yet to be fully explained or understood, not to mention the abundance of seemingly organized geometric shapes on its surface.

Expanding on the "spaceship moon" hypothesis, writer Don Wilson has written several books on the subject.[Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon](http://www.cseti.org/Our%20Mysterious%20Spaceship%20Moon/coverpage.htm) is available to read online (I highly recommend it...I spent over $50 for a physical copy), as well as [Secrets of Our Spaceship Moon](http://auricmedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Don_Wilson_Spaceship_Moon.pdf) (pdf).Another popular book on this subject is [Who Built the Moon?](http://www.whobuiltthemoon.com/)

God I missed shit like this.

The Earth is a Black Dwarf Star (burned-down star) and all the elements present here were home-grown.[13 minute video from Bill Gaede](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fINLrXi54zA)

Before It Was Brought Here. The Earth Without The Moon:https://www.varchive.org/itb/sansmoon.htm

The Moon is an artificial object that was flown to it's current location.

[The ancient time on Earth without a Moon.](https://www.varchive.org/itb/sansmoon.htm). A Moon either being brought here or built here (by an advance Creator(s)) could explain the Great Deluge and the numerous underground dwellings and cities, among the other anomalies of the moon (ie size ratio to Earth, and the pefectness of all proportions - not to far, not to close - just right distance to the sun, etc etc). I have a wacky thought that maybe the souls of Humans (who do not ascend) pass through the hollow Moon, and those who do ascend pass through the Hollow Earth. Hence why they call people "lunatics" and why people act freaky during a full moon in the night (ie. the freaks come out at night).

Is this the round table? Or is this the announcement for round table coming?

Can someone smart tell me how rare it actually is that our moon fits in the sun? I personally am agnostic due to the insane amount of coincidences like this but I'd like to know this, because space is a very real and fact (math)-based science.Regarding this: >There is no astronomical reason why the Moon and the Sun should fit so well. It is the sheerest of coincidences, and only the Earth among all the planets is blessed in this fashion.

I really like this article that explains the craters on the moon:http://www.thunderbolts.info/webnews/120707electriccraters.htmElectric Universe all the way.

all 4 rocky planets (mercury, venus and mars) could haveonce hosted life. the secret is melting the core. you can do that by simply moving the planet closer to the sunand wait. once you melt the core you get a magnetic field.not only that, planets may be growing in size(look for the growingearth theory) if this is true. mercury may become the next venus.venus may become the next earth. and as we all know earth will be the next mars. the only planet we have left is mars. if we want to make it life supportive we need alien advance technology to move it wheremercury is now. the it will spin faster than it should (einstein solve this)and it may gain back its liquid core, magnetic field, grow a littlecover itself in hot magma, and the cicle continues. thats my theory. 

The moon is a Hollow Alien Spacecraft:1)http://www.disclose.tv/news/the_biggest_secret_of_our_solar_system_is_our_moon_an_alien_spacecraft/1365172)http://scariestbookofalltime.blogspot.com/2010/01/no-moon-prior-to-11713-years-ago.html

There is also the theory that Zecharia Sitchin puts forth, that the Moon was actually a satellite of a different planet. To parallel the Tiamat vs Marduk story.http://www.sitchinstudies.com/the-sumerian-solar-system.html

The moon fits perfectly into the sun. How could that be?  Very simple, the thinking about the moon needs to change, stop assuming it is a giant rock, planet, or whatever. Think of it as 'the back of the sun' or a projection created by the sun. They are, in fact, the same entity, but that doesn't mean the moon doesn't have unique properties, such as the ability to cool objects exposed to moonlight. It is not a "place" you can visit, but the sun itself reflected, somehow.

Probably should have called this thread "Strictly for Professional Lunatics" lolWe know other planets have moons, both in our own solar system as well as in other systems in our galaxy but absolutely none of them have a moon that is anywhere as big as ours is in comparison to the size of the Earth itself. So that presents a curious anomaly as well as raising an interesting question about how the Earth could have initially attracted and held on to such a large moon when we have no other planets with moons that come anywhere close to being as big as they themselves are as we do and probably shouldn't have been able to do in light of that. That of course leads to the question about what the Moon itself and it's interior is made of and all the conjecture surrounding whether it may actually be hollow or not. Another interesting consideration is whether or nor what we have called and believed to be "craters" produced by meteors, may have actually been the result of some kind of violent and gaseous volcanic activity in the moon's distant past which would look pretty much the same when you look at and think about it from that perspective. You might want to cook and pay attention to a pot of oatmeal to get yourself into the mood for that. lol

Nah.. I was expecting for Gobekli Tepe..

The moon is what causes tidal forces on the oceans and gravitational pull in the earths core thus keeping the planet alive. I wouldn't be surprised if the moon was the original Noah's ark. Sounds fucking crazy lol

The Moon is your yin self. It is ever-changing from full to transparent. It is equal in size to the Sun, your yang self. That Moon and that Sun are yours alone. Both are conceptual manifestations of you. Neither entirely exists physically. They are right above you, inside the dome, you are inside your very own plane-ette of experience. The Sun appears as your corona, where a single point of intention to exist meets infinite non-existent potential erupting in bright heated light. The Moon is infinite manifest non-existence, manifest as existence. You are in between your Sun and your Moon on a plane-ette of experience, where all you see or know is self overlain on infinite individualities. All you see or know is your self externalized onto infinity from within a time-space conceptualization that is designed to keep you individual and sane within an infinite non existent conception.

Great book alert for this topic:  "Who Built the Moon" by Alan Butler. YL;DR: great analysis arguing that our moon had to be built by some form of intelligent life.

> Saturn's moon Iapetus (the "Death Star") has also been the subject of some of this high octane speculationSo Revelation Space? (It's a good read, with this very concept) - In regards to Iapetus being hollow - the density is slightly higher than that of pure water ice. If it were hollow, it would need to be able to sustain the same mass/size ratio as though it were another iceball. Tethys is in this same density category, as are most small moons around Saturn, and its rings are all pretty much particles around that same density too. (hovering around 1 g/cm^3)So just remember folks - nature doesn't have an agenda the same way that human beings vying for power do. It can be tested and doesn't intentionally hide anything.Coming from a background in astronomy and working in geosciences department, researchers are just normal people who use software to build models. There's enough material online you can learn the science on your own and use the same Python libraries [used by professionals](http://www.astropy.org/) - And all public funded projects have public data after a set time. So go crunch the numbers! I think the most controversial work out there is in ETI detection from huge data sets. [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03031) is an interesting approach that needs a lot further work.Could it be hollow? Sure, but if you're looking for a juicy conspiracy, there's more than enough happening with the Deep State right now.

Topics in this sub have been bangers lately. Keep it coming. Links and all.

Why are we trusting science fiction writers to put something in the "best" way about a real celestial body?> In the 1970's, two Soviet scientists proposed an alternative theory: Earth's moon may be a hollowed out spaceship.How does that explain it's density?

I don't usually comment here, but I will in this instance. It is a spectacular coincidence that total solar eclipses can happen right when humans are alive. Millions of years from now, the Moon will be farther away from Earth. It gets about 4cm farther from Earth every year, so millions of years from now it'll be so far that it'll look smaller in the sky and won't be able to block all of the Sun's light. If you run this in reverse, that means the Moon was closer in the past. In the distant past it was in the same place as Earth, meaning it came from Earth. Giant impact is really the only logical explanation to these observationsEdit: letters

I follow suit with the ship hypothesis with a way out their notion. I think it is the key to reincarnation. Our consciousness is nothing more than the sun providing the energy to the moon. The farther(sun) provides the seed to the womb of the mother(moon), giving birth to the holy ghost(earth)

the amount of shills here is wild. you can tell we hit something with this talk. 

I think we went to the moon , but faked all the footage shown to the public. I just can't see our paranoid cold war government giving away anything that could have been a tactical advantage to the USA. You had this absolutely batshit crazy paranoia about communists and you want me to believe that we were just going give away information about out advanced space vehicles, lunar modules, first photos of the moon etc. to the "commies" .  This sort of explains the Kubrick theory, and all the fake moon rocks.

 

This is a globe.https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rqr3x/this_is_a_globe_re_rconspiracy_round_table_3_the/

Tethys and Minas are also death stars. EDIT: Look at their heat signature, pacman eats ghosts, death stars are stars of death....

The moon has an equal chance of or being a flat somewhat translucent disc. There is documented stars being seen through the unlit portion of the moon. We also know it is much smaller due to the shadow size being approx 70miles  in the upcoming eclipse.Interesting stuff, more interesting is that mainstreamed science won't touch this possibility. Likely to continue to cover up the moon landing hoax. 

there are lots of movies, songs and shows lately that speak about the end. it's well past 2012 so i don't think it has anything to do with that. i think something really is coming. kanye tried to tell people the truth recently and he got taken off to the hospital by handcuffs....bieber has been going to bible study and he cancelled his tour. idk. things just seem weird. i just heard harry styles song "sign of the times" and i can't get it out of my head. i know this is kind of off topic but predictive programming is 100% real and we need to talk more about it. 

well there's good 'evidence' of underground cavern systems on the moon but i like the idea it's a huge hollowed out space ship. Easy to test I guess with usa, china, russia, and everyone wanting to go there to exploit/ experiment/ prove concept. 

Breath of fresh air isn't it.

Whoever built the pyramids had a [clear understanding of the size of the earth and the moon.](http://blog.world-mysteries.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GreatPyramid_Blueprint.jpg) But what is astounding to me is that the earth and the moon are so perfectly balanced. Why did these ancient cultures [know the shape and size of these bodies thousands of years ago?](http://blog.world-mysteries.com/mystic-places/decoding-giza-pyramids-part-3/) And WHY do the Earth, Sun, Moon have these  [mathematic relationships?](https://i0.wp.com/joedubs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/108-Earth-Sun-and-Moon.jpg)[Here is some more interesting info](http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/2016/01/20/the-metre/) about our units of measurement and their relationships to the moon.Considering the moon is the ONLY moon that is perfectly round, faces its planet with the same side always, and is the PERFECT distance and size from the earth to eclipse the sun, it seems like the moon is the most likely candidate for an artificial satellite. But it still blows my mind as to HOW and WHY??There are harmonious mathematical relationships between many of the other planets as well. [Here's the astounding relationship between Earth and Venus.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFDBeTdPKig)And [here's another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcJiRmZ9WmY) that shows the relationships between all the other planets in the solar system.

This is an interesting relationship that I hadn't seen before. It's interesting except for one small detail. Pi is approximated as 22/7, not 11/7. 22/7 ‚âà 3.1428...

Thank you very kindly for this information. Wonderful rabbit hole to delve into. And thanks for making sticky threads on topics that are considered as "fringe" as this one. Very refreshing to see on this sub (especially with all the politics garbage dominating the front page).

Glad to see someone mentioning Van Flandern.  Also important to mention that he hypothesized that planets & moons are "born" out of a fission process:https://youtu.be/eu0K_7q_xEI?t=3851This is the only theory I'm aware of that really makes sense with Velikovsky's conclusion that Venus was ejected from Jupiter (the red spot).

I find this CIA experiment with ~~Ingo Swann~~ don't remember who it was, but may have been, to be interesting and relevant:The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope.

Isn't it established that a planet *was* supposed to be there but Jupiter's gravity kinda prevented the accretion?Quick wikipedia:>The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals.[7] Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet.[7][8] Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt

It could have been destroyed by a gamma ray burst or perhaps an extremely temporary occurrence of  strange matter collision that caused the annihilation of Planet V. 

Literally the plot of "Inherit the Stars", ca 1977.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giants_series

hmm.. couldnt find the equiptment failing part, but in the wiki said:The density of Phobos has now been directly measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3.[57] Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile.[57] In addition, images obtained by the Viking probes in the 1970s clearly showed a natural object, not an artificial one.  :(

The cardiac cadence/circadian rhythm and biological clock conform almost precisely to the Martian day.

The Earth spun faster in the past. 

It seems as though newer studies put it back closer to 24 hours:http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/07/human-biological-clock-set-back-an-hour/

unfortunately for that theory, the old days were shorter.  length of the day is increasing over time. hence the leap seconds.  my internal clock goes on 36hs, but neither my wife nor my boss want me to sleep 12hs longer each day ;-)

Or maybe humans are originally from another planet that has 25 hour day and has much better ecosystem for humans. Who knows maybe Atlantis or Garden of Eden are not places or cities on Earth in the past but actual Planets in our Galaxy or beyond...

> and some astronomical event slowed it downWhich would happen when the earth has grown since. 

if there is a civ that able to make nuclear, of course they would able to make bunker as well, and to debunk those prehistoric nuclear warfare on mars, someone simply need to find those bunker in the future or mars exploration

My guess is that this wave anomaly is from a cloak that hides whats on the moon.  Or maybe what we think is a rock in space is something else entirely, and only made to look like a rock in space.

Better video that shows 10 wave captures and discusses them from someone who shot the first one.  Also tells how he was attacked by official sources.  He has many videos talking about this and what it may mean.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM

Really?  I read an in depth explanation on how this "wave" anomaly *was* caused by the camera.  I'll have to dig for the post.edit:  found the possible explanation.https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/26sby2/hologram_visual_wave_covering_the_moon/chuav6y/Unless that's been debunked I thinks it's a very reasonable explanation.

I think it's a similar effect like asphalt on a hot day. The ground looks wavy and moving.The atmosphere has an amount of heat I'd assume(even at night) but since it's at such a large scale the waves aren't as extreme

My vote is refraction from shifting air density in Earth's atmosphere.

what in the actual fuck !  its like someone turned V-sync off on the moon lol, on a serious note though, any scientific explanation / debunking to this ?

Hologram theory is interesting, but people need to remember it's not the government, it is some other intelligence or "creator" who is showing us that hologram, this is part of the theory that we are essentially in a prison planet, zoo, or some type of ant farm/sim city project. The other about moon waves is more simple, and biblical, which is that space is water, and we are lied to about it. As above, so below. God separated the waters from the waters. I've always liked the water theory because it explains a lot. Look at space, planets, stars in a telescope and you see it all looks like it's  lights under water. Astronauts train in water, their suits are built to exist in water. The deepest sea dive ever recorded that they found water within water, a shore with waves underneath the ocean and they simply bounced off when trying to submerge in the secondary pool. 

Can't watch the video, but had this shower thought: could it be a Schlieren effect from a plane passing by?

[Here is a youtube channel that is all about that](https://www.youtube.com/user/Crrow777/videos)

 

What the fuck 

Some think these make the moon look holographic, but I think the moon is hollow, and that vibration is like when you ring a bell and the surface vibrates. NASA states that when they landed on the moon it [rang like a bell!](https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/15mar_moonquakes.html)

The moon is an astral body. And we are dreaming. Our Physical reality is built with a template that reflects our state of what we call dreaming. So in a sense everything is from that template and it's product though it seems solid, is actually the dream manifest.Especially light bodies in space. These bodies receive influx of energy to maintain their form. Just like we do. Only we don't analyze how our own energy field ripples. It does, just like the moon's energy field. It's template reality.

Is there footage of said anomaly taken from space?

Why could this video not be faked, just like NASA faking theirs?

My god that is terrifying.  I got actual chills watching that, and the feeling that I...shouldn't have been seeing it.  Like something out of Lovecraft.  Never even heard of this before either, thanks man

many people are now seeing the moon glitch and change shape as well as refresh like a computer projection

**WTF Clouds behind our Sun and Moon ?**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgnVRdQ7wg0

Could those waves be something closer, a part of our atmosphere?They are cool, though.

Not, being a dick, but can you provide link for debunks, curious.

Where else have you seen a "hologram refresh" , what makes you believe that?Why do you believe that "camera artifacts" can be debunked, but not that it being a hologram be debunked, because that has been debunked a thousand times over

> And no, it's not the camera or an artifact, that's been debunked multiple times.I'm gonna go with the explanation that it's definitely either the camera or an artifact. That or maybe it's hot air in front of the camera.

Those are fraudulent.  Observe the moon with your own equipment and you will never see one.

This is a great comment, it should have responses.The UNLESS is very intriguing here.

I can't help but wonder if it's a property marker, much like these....https://duckduckgo.com/?q=obelisk&t=ffsb&iax=1&ia=images

the far side of the moon would, in fact, be the face of the sun. I believe they would align perfectly.

cool, might as get this over with

 

The moon doesn't orbit in a perfect circle around the earth.  Sometimes it's closer, some times it's further away. In fact, the difference between the closest and farthest points is about 30,000 miles.This does have an appreciable effect on how big the moon appears, and can even make it appear noticeably smaller than the sun.  An [annular eclipse](https://www.google.com/search?q=annular+eclipse&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPlJWIs7zVAhUG0mMKHdG6D8YQ_AUICigB&biw=1600&bih=794) is when the moon eclipses the sun, but is close to the far point in its orbit.  This makes the moon smaller than the sun in the sky, allowing a ring of sunlight to pass around the moon (this ring is called an annulus).

No, it would have to be much much more than 100 miles. 100 miles is nothing.Also the moon doesn't stay the same distance all around the earth, just as the earth isn't always the same distance from the sun. During a perfect solar eclipse, the moon doesn't quite cover the whole sun as we still see a kind of halo around the moon. If they were the exact same size in the sky we wouldn't get that.

now I know a lot of Christians don't believe in aliens due to not being explicitly written in the Bible, but my theory is that if God designed the Earth to be so full of all sorts of diverse lifeforms, why would he leave the rest of the Universe barren of other life? Surely he would populate them with all sorts of unique life as to reflect His glory. After all, human curiosity has taken us to journey out of the Earth. What good would this curiosity do if there was nothing to find out there?

ironically, nowadays that in itself is a crazy conspiracy theory to a lot of people :P, but one i agree with, although i do hope other planets with life exist and that god didn't decide to stop with us for some reason. 

i believe A god made it. or rather a very intelligent being and we are the product of a large science experiment and we aren't the only ones. and other planets in our solar system have undergone the same testing. mostly mars 

The moon is actually drifting away, what's "convenient" is that we get to see it at a time when it appears to be approximately the same size as the sun.

The chance of that occurring by accident is much more incredible than most people realize.

They're not that perfect. Only for those right in the path of the shadow.http://www.eclipse2017.org/2017/maps/whole-us.jpg

It is also ludicrously unlikely!

Well no one complains about the odds of evolution which is just as unlikely.  

Great post. 

perhaps they did fake the Moon landing in order to prove to the public that the Moon is uninhabited when in fact it is settled by other civilizations. William Tompkins stated in his book that when Apollo 11 landed in Tranquility, there were huge alien warships circled around the edge of the crater. later they used other films to show to the public broadcast instead. then with the alien's permission the apollo program sent several other missions before being barred from coming back again

Religious reasons, they think the earth being round is the number one thing in history that leads people away from god, and a flat earth would absolutely have to be designed

 

The purpose is to hide God. Read your bible,the sun wasn't made until the 4th day and it was made to give light to the earth. There is nothing in the bible that supports a spinning ball earth rotating around the sun. Please dont point to Isaiah 40:22 and tell me that proves a ball earth,it literally says circle. A circle isn't a ball. Satan rules the world right now (Luke 4:5-7) and we are in the age of deception. Pray for discernment and read your bible.

I heard the ridge was a result of a ring like Saturns collapsing after formation. 

Iapetus is the Roman name for Japheth.Japheth was the eldest son of Noah, and his sons were the first to be taught by God how to bury their dead, and the supposed progenitor of the Caucasians.Japheth was a Roman way of saying someone has Greek blood (i.e. a bloodline from time immemorial).

[Bright Insight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=335vSSTjWdI).  People claim to have seen lights coming from the moon.  Moon Express is launching a mining operation to the south pole of the moon.  Moon rocks from the moon contain unnatural (artificial) isotopes.  It goes on and on!

David Icke talks about this in his books and even mentions some of the work shown here. Starts around the 51:00 mark https://youtube.com/watch?v=VJorKZEbQsA

I was interested, but I couldn't handle the presenter.  I'm a little disappointed.

Interesting hypothesis.

Never heard this one.

Holy shit.  That was fucking amazing.  I was expecting some sort of stupid Hollow Earth calibre idea here, but that... kinda makes sense...

It's cool seeing hypothesis that go against the mainstream. It's less cool seeing hypothesis that argument against an imaginary theory, because the author do not understand the mainstream theory.He claims "mathematicians" claim that heavier elements formed in DISTANT random supernovaes. The actual idea is that they formed on the supernova that originated our system, using the atoms of a single supernova to build the current sun and planets.Just like arguments of the fake moon landing. It could be fake, but arguments like "you should see the stars!" are not helping the case at all.

The moon has incredibly irregular gravity, which makes having this orbit it quite difficult. So the grand plans of towing asteroids into orbit of the moon are much harder than people think. The gravity is irregular because of discrepancies in the density of different parts of the moon. There is quite a wealth of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed. 

I love that you swing both ways ;-)So, if you mentioned Pink Floyd, is it a coincidence they were friends with Douglas Adams, creator of HHGTG?Now, that was a book that made my thought juices flow!

Why not though? The universe is ginormous and strange and rare things happen all the time. The moon was once closer to the earth and its getting farther away each year, meaning one day it won't appear the same size as the sun in the sky. We are just fortunate enough to be alive at this time to witness this.

Shower thought.. Moon is artificial Moon doesn't perfectly eclipse When did it? Answer this and we know how old the moon is. Why was a perfect eclipse necessary? Someone needed a window against the Sun's direct energy? Then again, night would solve that... Literally just crazy thoughts about something I've never really thought about 

Why wouldn't you see blue sky? You don't see it through the moon so much as you see the bright part of the moon reflecting sunlight through the blue sky.Having said that, it is interesting that the moon and sun appear almost the same size in the sky. 

> I was always curious as to why we could see the blue sky through the MoonYou don't see the blue sky through the Moon, you see the Moon through the blue sky.Imagine a crescent moon at night.  The dark side of it appears black, much like the space surrounding it.  Now imagine the same crescent moon during the day, the "dark" side appears blue, much like the space surrounding it.Also, if it were semi-transparent, then how do you explain Earthshine?

you can see the dark side of the moon during the day (or at night) with a telescope. its not transparent. the sky is blue and you see the bright moon through the sky not the blue sky through the moon.

> It is too a coincidence we never see the 'dark side of the Moon'It's the inevitable result of Earths gravitation influence. If you nudged the moon and made it spin a bit faster, it would eventually go back to how it is now. 

> The moon also has an atmosphere. Google it.Too thin an atmosphere to support liquid water or greenery as we know it.   >The moon is an artificial satellite. There is overwhelming evidence for this. There is not.

jesus... I wish there was enough funding to send all of the moon deniers or people who think it is a hologram or has an atmosphere, up to the moon so they can check it out themselves.Commercial spaceflight cant come soon enough...

Go on

Thank you for this. A very interesting read, like most of your posts and the links you share. Thanks for being a light in the darkness!

This is the round table.

Love this song.  

All the planets in our solar system. I'm sure in the billions of galaxies there are more that have this rare feature. Maybe not.

> Can someone smart tell me how rare it actually is that our moon fits in the sun?Not that rare.  100% of the Earth's moons behave in this manner.

not just that it fits in there but that it fits in there while humans are on earth. a few million years ago and it was too close for a perfect fit in a few million years from now it will be too far away for a perfect fit. factthat it is a perfect fit in the time when humans can use this to better observe the sun and space and it is all so damn perfect it is Ludacris. 

Okay, I read the link.. I get the basics in reference to the crates and whatnot, but what, exactly does this whole theory express? I don't want to buy the book.

That's cool I didn't know the thing about the moon meteorites.  Thanks

That's a very interesting thought

lol what? just what? the moon doesn't cool objects in its light. what? the sun and the moon are not the same thing. you can see them both in the same sky at the same time. what kind of primitive thinking are you using here?

Lunatics...  Interested in the moon!

You do relatise that Pluto has a moon, Charon, that's quite similar in size to Pluto itself? I know it's been desclasified as a planet, but it's a celestial object with another just as large as itself in orbit around each other.

Suggest it for the next one! Better yet, compile some info and make your own post! I think a more general "anomalous ancient sites" topic would be a great future round table. For example, [here's some stuff I found out about Puma Punku](https://www.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/1q912q/puma_punku_is_an_ancient_archaeological_site_in/), an amazing site in Bolivia.tbh, the civilizations associated with these sites and the origin of the moon might be more related that you might think (we're supposed to be going high octane, right?).After all, Aristotle wrote of an ancient people called the "Proselenes" who lived in Arcadia and who were said, by the very nature of their name, to have lived "before there was a moon in the sky".Some writers (ie the authors of Who Built the Moon?) think future humanity literally went back in time to put the moon there. 

I see 38 votes for moon anomalies, 5 for phobos anomalies, and 10 for hollow earth which easily puts this topic at #1.

 

Lemme elaborate on this since ive read about in on the internet, when you die your spirit, not your soul, releases its grip on the body, causing a release of heat, this heat will carry your spirit to the moon where the moon will absorb and digest it, your spirit will cease to exist, BUT, if you managed to develop a soul from the seed that is your spirit in your lifetime you will be able to choose wether to stay in our solar system within the ifluence of the sun as a soul, to feed the moon consciously, or to travel straight into the sun and become one with our creator, that is what ive read, yes what a crock of shit

Not exactly.

thats the craziest thing I've ever heard that gets thrown around a lot. Don't believe that nonsense, it's to instill fear.

The moon is less dense than earth, which actually supports the hollow moon theory. If the moon was formed by material ejected from the earth in a collision, then that material would have come from the crust of the earth, not the earth's denser core.  The collision formation theories are most accepted, but vary from what objects collided with the earth to form the moon.  Seismometers placed on the moon in the 1970's, though, recorded the moon "ringing like a bell."  By this time we'd landed on the darn thing and still weren't convinced the moon was solid.  Of course, the argument can be made that a society sophisticated enough to craft a moon sized space station could sufficiently camouflage it to fool the primitives who live on the host planet.

I have heard the moon being translucent and stars being seen through the unlit half of the moon but never witnessed this or ever seen pictures/video of it. I imagine with all the eyes in the world looking up at the moon that we would have some pictures out there of stars in the dark side of the moon but they just don't exist. I have a telescope and can see the unlit half of the moon during the day. its always there and it has never appeared to be see through any time I have ever looked at it. 

>Whoever built the pyramids had a clear understanding of the size of the earth and the moon.That's not proof they understood the size of the Earth and Moon, just that they were able to produce a pyramid with a set of dimensions that squared the circle. The Earth and Moon do the same "coincidentally", but someone on Earth could figure out those proportions and admire their mathematical elegance *on their own* without ever looking up at the sky.

>Considering the moon is the ONLY moon that is perfectly round, faces its planet with the same side always,Both of those statements are wrong. There are plenty of perfectly spherical moons in the solar systems, name just about any moon of a jovian planet and its likely to be spherical. Also, Pluto and Charon are tidally locked (which is the term for when a moon orbits at the same speed of its rotation so one side is constantly facing the planet) to one another. I think there are a few other cases of tidal locking in the solar system as well. 

Yeah...a satellite. Arabs before being Muslims were venerating the Moon...see 3/4 of muslim countries flags and coat of arms featuring quarter moons.So you're saying there was a a satellite of the moon in the 7th century?

Aliens, aliens gave humans that knowledge. Also possibly fallen angels enamored with human women. 

I realized that right after I made the post, thank you, it's 22/7.

Funny how some people put effort into finding patterns between numbers everywhere, yet don't put any effort into remembering (or even checking) for arguably the most know value of all, Pi. Says a lot about what their true aim is.Maybe if one would invest more time into understanding and less time into explaining, the world would be a better place.

You said it brother

It was Joe McMoneagle. Ingo Swann did write an amazing book (That you can find for free online as a pdf) called 'Penetration' In which he remote viewed the dark side of the moon. And what he found was amazing. He also talks about the strange but proven facts of the moon such as how it has an atmosphere, Wind, Greenery, Water, ect.If you guys are interested in this stuff please check out my sub r/projectstargate I also have a video interview posted of McMoneagle talking about that "Trip" to mars.

The Mars/Jupiter papers are both great.  Page 6 of the Jupiter paper discusses solar & planetary fission... something I hadn't heard of outside of Van Flandern.  Thanks! 

Dun dun dun

Is that the prevailing theory in cosmology? Is it just the assumed natural evolution of the solar system?  i.e. What would happen if nothing dramatic occured astronomically to affect the earth's motion? Or, is there evidence of this rate of rotation decreasing?  Anyhow, it doesn't explain the biological clock.  

interesting thanks!

Length is gradually increasing over time, okay, but that ignores my suggestion that an astronomical event dramatically decreased it at some time in the past.

That's a lot of growth.  If that's your theory, where'd it come from?

that's flawed, the nuclear war he talks about apparently gouged out massive canyon's and is singlehandedly responsible for factmars is a desert wasteland now, hell it used to have oceans, to assume anyone beyond the very rare bunker or statue or temple, and i mean VERY rare, is absolutely absurd. Although i like the way you think. 

now this i can get behind. perhaps its a cloaking device that keeps amateur astronomers from seeing the cities and bases built there

>  maybe what we think is a rock in space is something else entirelyLike an alien observation station and its off limits for humans.

This is actually one of the better theories out there. Thank you for a very fresh alternative perspective.I do remember a certain researcher (God I forgot the name, I think he had some really long lectures on the Moon and Mars on Youtube) discuss how probes sent to the Moon hit a giant wall before coming to a halt. As if there were structures on the Moon. Built by aliens? Built by ancient humans? Current humans? Who knows, it is an interesting theory though.

interesting, it could also be waves caused by a change in temperature in the layer between moon and layers of atmosphere or there is a layer of water between us and the moon layer.

Great channel actually was watching some stuff on there before I found this thread. 

 

If the equipment causes it, why does the 'wave' go out of frame in one video where he pans, then it reappears in the frame from the bottom edge without having changed speed or angle, exactly where it would have been if he hadn't panned? EDIT: [video here](https://youtu.be/XL5zuq5mtwc)I don't see how this clip is compatible with that redditor's explanation. The wave phenomenon seems to be totally decoupled from any equipment effects.

That's not an explination.  I've never heard about this stuff until today, but if you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM&app=desktop) about a third of the way through it he shows how the camera will pan and the wave will not pan with it, which clearly shows it's something external to the device. The only explination that makes any sense in light of that information is that it's atmospheric. 

Sure it is a good explanation but that doesn't mean that single comment discredits the entire thing, and what helps back my thought up is the comment below it blindly accepts it so quickly.  https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/26sby2/hologram_visual_wave_covering_the_moon/chuegx9/

sorry but that's not the same effect. your example shows the entire image effected. like when you take a pic when your phone vibrates. the moon wave is completely different bc the entire photo doesnt vibrate. there is clearly a wave anomaly that is happening on the moon. the wave on moves across the surface. it pulses and is not constant as your effect describes. space above it not effected. its a sweeping wave that moves consistently across the surface and wraps the curvature of the moon. 

Too bad the heat waves coming up from the ground are in a randomized chaotic pattern, not a formulated straight forward line like on the moon. Riddle me that.

except its not a hot day on the moon.. ever..

Looks to me like it's only on the moon though..if it was an atmospheric phenomenon, you'd see that wave in the space around the moon too

You didn't look at the evidence.

ive looked and i cant find any scientific article even mentioning it.

>  and they simply bounced offThey bounced off because it wasn't water, it was brine and of a higher density and buoyancy than water.

It's the atmosphere, dude. Gas is fluidic, just observe the behavior of air above pavement on a hot day. That's why it all looks like lights under water *from an Earth-situated telescope* but not from any videos from in space (assuming you believe any of them are real).

> essentially in a prison planet, zoo, or some type of ant farm/sim city project.You are referring to Gnosticism. Where God is real, and the universe was created, but not by God but a kind of "malevolent force" with the hopes of separating consciousness and hiding from consciousness it's beginning/true power. This is the ancient religion that the Matrix movies are based around. > I've always liked the water theory because it explains a lotLiterally impossible as red/blue shifting wouldn't be a thing and at a certain distance away from us stars would just not be visible (like just about any source of light not in our solar system).

well space isn't a true vacuum anyways, it has material that floats around. though if applying the holofractal theory, space is considered a type of matter

 

I want to find that video of the water in watet. I remember seeing years ago. The water had a current and waves. It was so wierd. I don't recall the part where they bounced off it though. It was some time ago.

I think if this was proven to not be atmosphere (as it's definitely not equipment related) then it would serve as proof that we're living in a simulated reality.

Don't you dare fucking bring god into this, that ruins any shred of credibility.

Or an illusion caused by temperature change, shifting air masses, water vapor or any host of atmospheric event- especially if the waves move from the bottom upward? 

Thanks!

Yes. This is the same reason stars twinkle.

search youtube for moon wave, there are plenty of other examples.  It's really weird, looks like a video that's refreshing

 

I think you're taking that a good ways out of context. Since they're talking about seismic activity it reads as if he's referring to long, continued vibrations and shaking. Something like a handbell or even the vibrations felt after striking a bell. That doesn't necessarily mean it's hollow, just that he was describing the very long time frames of the tremors. 

Ok so if we're dreaming, what and where are our real bodies that are currently sleeping? 

> glitchAny video of this?

I can't stand this as a flat earth argument. 

Argument for a locality. These kind of pics cast doubt on their actual distance... This is part of how I startd to wonder if things are different than our education teaches us.

That's not right

 

Are we, like...the chosen ones?

Thought to be fair, just because something has low odds of occurring doesn't mean it can't occur. 

*Never tell me the odds!**That's no moon!*Star Wars overload!

The moon used to be closer to the Earth though. It's moving away from us at consistent pace. 

This.

This kind of stuff more or less cherrypicks in various ways, between which celestial bodies are being compared, the grounds for comparison, and the relationships being found.  For every one "Woah" relationship found, a hundred duds were thrown out.If you examine everything for all conceivable relationships, the biggest coincidence would be finding no coincidences.

Evolution doesn't happen by chance. Evolution is the result of natural selection. For your comparison to be true, there would had to have been many different shaped and sized moons orbiting Earth, yet now only one remains due to its specific shape and size.

All this comment means is that you don't, or don't want to, understand evolution. 

I think it's pretty likely. The variety of breeds humans have been able to produce just by selective breeding kind of shows how we can make animals change to have certain traits. Now just do that but for millions of years and eventually the DNA will be so far apart that breeds won't be able to produce viable offspring anymore. 

So because the Bible says the Earth is round even when everyone else thought it was flat.  So the Catholic church figured if people realized it was flat they wouldn't believe in God so it started a conspiracy to this day to get more church members?  Clearly all of this is created either way.  Either we are creating this reality, or another entity is.  I mean the flat earth has to be at the most likely to not exist out of 100's.  I doubt 10% on /conspiracy believe it's flat.  There's just so much evidence from pictures of the Earth from space.  I don't think any of it has to do with religion.  The Roman Catholics did get very corrupt just after a few hundred years though so I wouldn't put it past them to lie to scare people into giving money.

 

I have the same attitude towards the flat earth theory as you do. If it were flat, I don't think it just be so NASA can rack in cash. I believe it would be hundreds of years before NASA was even born, that the deception would have started. But then we have People like Newton who would also have to be a lie.Too me, as a guy who's only watched like 20 mins about it, maybe the earth is simply bigger then what they tell us?  Apparently NASA means to deceive in Hebrew. Huge if true.

I read the Bible 3 times a year cover to cover brother.  I've only seen support for a round earth over and over and over in the Bible.

There's nothing in the bible that supports airplanes either, but I rode in one just the other day.

Even [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_ridge_on_Iapetus) for the equatorial ridge is pretty explicit:>It is not clear how the ridge formed. One difficulty is to explain why it follows the equator almost perfectly. There are at least four current hypotheses, but none of them explains why the ridge is confined to Cassini Regio.It's easily one of the most incredible unexplained things we've discovered in our solar system.The ring "Chicken Little" theory [was suggested by](https://gizadeathstar.com/2014/04/can-relax-now-mysterious-equatorial-ridge-iapetus-finally-explained/) *Discover* Magazine:>The *Discover* article points out that the theory has not yet been "peer reviewed", but there it is. We're being asked to believe on the basis of a computer-claptrap model that the ridge "fell from the sky" after "rings" were formed around the planet, rings which were unstable, and which fell into the surface of the planet.>Uh huh. What about those three parallel grooves? Were there three neatly parallel ring unstable ring systems?There's actually *another* theory that "Iapetus may have possessed its own moon that became tidally shredded to create a ring system that eventually fell to the moon's surface.">OK...a moon with a moon which became tidally shredded to form a neat ring, which was unstable, which then fell to Iapetus' surface and formed that neat equatorial ridge. And, presumably, became shredded in such a way to form three closely bunched parallel rings in three planes which were all unstable and then fell to the planetary surface?>Would Iapetus have had sufficient force to be able to shred its own moon? Can we see what the possible mass of that moon may have been? Would it have been enough to create the equatorial ridge?"But whatever the source, it seems scientists are agreeing that Iapetus couldn't have created the mountain range without some help from up above.">I don't know about you, but that strikes me as yet another tongue in cheek remark. "Help from above?" Help implies helpers. Helpers implies intelligence. Intelligence implies...>...on yea, we can't go there. The ridge has been "explained." Perfectly natural. >Nothing to see here...move along, it fell from the sky after a moon was tidally shredded to form an unstable ring system which collapsed and fell on poor Iapetus....

You are right, he definitely has a chip on his shoulder. He is brilliant, however. He is responsible for smuggling Pentium computer chip tech to the Soviets early nineties...

I think this one is from the Stellar Metamorphosis theory. Basically, the universe is a lot older than 13.8 billion years... possibly eternal. And all planets are formed from the eroded leftovers of stars.According this this theory, the sun would be the youngest object in our solar system. Jupiter would be a fair bit older. Earth would be a lot older and Mercury is absolutely ancient.

That other physicist that people post here theorized that everything is a black hole and all we see are the event horizons 

Thanks for commenting!

Orbiting the moon is certainly impractical. For parking asteroids for mining purposes, the earth-moon lagrange points L4 and L5 would make a lot more sense, though I'm not sure how viable"landing" something the size of substantial asteroid into those points would be; on-site extraction might just be more practical than moving the entire asteroids.

 

Why don't planets stop spinning then, as they are like moons to the sun?Do other planets moons not rotate?Edit: Found this cool article: http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/44-our-solar-system/the-moon/general-questions/110-does-the-moon-rotate-are-there-other-moons-that-always-keep-one-face-toward-their-planet-intermediate, which provides info towards my second question.  Interesting stuff

>Too thin an atmosphere to support liquid water or greenery as we know it.What is you PhD in? Where do you base this on? When accredited scientists have proven otherwise.> There is not.Edited:Prove to me that the moon is a natural satellite. I can, and will debunk this. History books on the moon are, and have been re written. New evidence trumps old theories.

What about the 3 Apallo spacecraft that were fuelled, and ready to bring men back to the moon, that were left to rust. We have the money to go back. We already spent some. But TPTB refuse to. Why is that? You said "If only there was funding." Like our fiat monetary system couldnt establish that. We dont go back to the moon for a very exact reason.

Our grandchildren will laugh at our presumptions the same way we laugh at our grandfathers.

I can elaborate on this. The moon's distance and size relative to the earth is almost too coincidental to be naturally occurring. There is a fair amount of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed. There are records in some extremely ancient cultures of certain peoples being around 'before the moon'. There is no theory for the formation of the moon that makes sense, the impact theory is something championed by most people but they don't read the next paragraph of that theory which states that an almost equal impact would have been necessary directly after to correct course and spin. The is a very compelling case that the moon isn't naturally occurring. If you're interested read a book called 'Who built the moon' by Christopher Knight. Very interesting, although their conclusions leave something to be desired. The theory that it was flown here has risen from a combination of these different anomalies. It would make sense to place a large body like the moon around a planet a species was interested in interacting with, sort of like hiding in plain sight. The notion that the moon isnt naturally occurring gives credence to this. Of course it's just a theory, there is no conclusive proof it is a type of space ship. But then again, if there was conclusive proof this topic wouldn't be in the conspiracy subreddit ;).  

hahah like really go on. 

Sweet. I'll be checking in on this one. I hope it's a hallowed out space ship. That's crazy cool.

actually the table is a sphere

[Exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB2Ad04mukI)

Well at least you understood my small effort to inject a little humour. The original meaning of "lunatic" actually meant being under the spell of the Moon or "Luna" which is it's ancient name, like the ancient one for the Sun which is "Sol" from which we get solar, solstice, etc.The French word for the moon still is "la Lune" and there were of course people in ancient times who worshipped the Moon and "Diana" who was the goddess of the Moon and was believed to live on the Moon and they used to dance and frolic under the light of the full Moon in their outdoor ceremonies dedicated to her. And then there's the whole business about moonlight being romantic and people falling in love in the moonlight.And the Moon is very strange and mysterious and we really don't know very much about it and a whole lot of people really are utterly fascinated by the whole business... almost to the point of being under a spell by it.But there can't be any of those "lunatics", here, now can there? Or maybe I should have said "moon-atics"? 

The astronomers no longer consider Pluto to be a planet for a number of valid reasons and it's difficult to say what either Pluto and Charon actually are at this point. If I'm not mistaken Charon is the much larger of the two and they both actually orbit around a point in space *between them* that actually traces their path around the Sun. It's unusual because that point between them is closer to Pluto giving Charon an outer orbit around that point and Pluto taking an inner orbit around it on the opposite side of it as if they were rigidly connected through that point in their motions. So it isn't any typical planet/moon arrangement but two bodies orbiting an invisible point as if they were both moons going around it. Their tumbling orbit around the Sun as they wheel around it together is also highly unusual and brings them even closer to the Sun than Neptune is throughout parts of it probably because they weren't created by or with our system but rather captured and pulled into that off-kilter orbit after being cast-off from another system beyond ours.

was it the Alex jones and David Ich one?

That's no moon...

> The moon is less dense than earth, which actually supports the hollow moon theory.How?

Yeah. I've heard the distance increases the rate of recession, so it's 4cm/year now, but a million years from now it could be 1km/year (just making up numbers to explain)But yes right now the sun and moon share the same apparent diameter. In the distant future that won't be the case anymore, making total solar eclipses impossible.

What do you mean by>strange but proven facts of the moon such as how it has an atmosphere, Wind, Greenery, Water,

>  Or, is there evidence of this rate of rotation decreasing?Yes, [we've measured it decreasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) 

Not really _my_ theory, just a thought I love to entertain, simply for the beauty of it (the continent coasts don't only fit where the Atlantic is, but also where the pacific is). "[Expanding Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanding_Earth)" gives nice search results on YouTube, and it seems to overlap here and there with "Electric Universe"/"Plasma Universe" approaches to cosmology. Interesting trivia: it _precedes_ Wegeners plate tectonics theory by almost a century :)

I've found the moon rabbit hole is deep and one of the most disturbing, because dealing with the implications of all the strangeness, coincidences, and anomalies having to do with the moon is so far-reaching it can shake the foundations of everything you think you know.Crrow777, the man who captured the first video of the lunar wave, has a good Youtube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Crrow777) if you want to dive in.  You can search for "moon" in his videos, but he delves into a lot more.  This guy will have you questioning everything.

You are thinking of Phobos, a moon of Mars.The Soviets sent 22 probes, none sent back useful info - one is even rumoured to have filmed a rocket leave the surface and impact the Soviet's probe.

There's a great video of (amateur?) rocket equipped with outer camera going from surface of the earth to zero gravity. It's almost as if it hits the water. Google it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/26sby2/hologram_visual_wave_covering_the_moon/chuhvh7/that's also explained. > He rotated the camera with respect to the 'field' and corrected the image with editing software or a field rotation prism in the telescope>You are probably right on and in one of his videos he says he done exactly as you say, rotating the camera then turning the image back right with editing software.

Because it is fraud by Crow77. Make your own observations and you will never see one.

Or Fraud.  That would explain it.  It would also explain why no one else has observed.

He's saying that since the camera is on earth (and in Florida in this particular video), the heat in earth's atmosphere may cause a visible ripple. 

no the moon but OUR atmosphere here on Earth. we are looking through it to the moon which distorts its image slightly. thats my take on it. Not that the moon is hot

That's assuming the wave covers the entire length of the cameras POV, which translates to thousands of miles. Stars twinkle all the time precisely because of these atmospheric waves, but they don't twinkle in unison because these shifting densities are smaller in scale than that.

No, we wouldnt expect to see it on the dark area around the moon -- there is no light from there reaching our eyes. 

I watched the video.  What evidence do you mean?

I don't believe anything anymore 

Too bad the heat waves coming up from the ground are in a randomized chaotic pattern, not a formulated straight forward line like on the moon. Riddle me that.

What's the holofractal theory? I try visit that sub but can't understand anything posted there 

Near vacuum.

Search for 'Underwater brine pools'.

It's so hard to find the real video with the researchers talking about it, it was intentionally deleted I believe by the BBC and they were able to have youtube delete basically all the uploads. That's one of those things where you have to wonder what is so damaging about that account from a scientist that they went to that much effort to erase it entirely. Much like antarctica, there is much hidden about the deep ocean for unknown reasons, very little is allowed to be released to the public. 

[Is this it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZD2STt_OU)

perhaps, but what intrigues me is why the wave seems to follow the curvature of the moon rather than just traveling over 

It is fraud, plain and simple.

you win the award for the worlds most ignorant response 

It doesn't do that through a telescope.  I've tried many times.  I don't know if it's the atmosphere or the video camera but it isn't the moon.  I know that for sure.  It's real and round 100%.  I know this is /conspiracy but I have a lot of friends with big telescopes.  

 

Sweet!  I do that too!  I just need a better camera to mount on my lens.  Right now it's decent but maybe half the quality as these vids.  It's really cool to have a telescope with GPS hooked up to a camera recording on your laptop. 

way to take what they said out of context. seismic activity needs shifting plates. considering NASA previous statements about the moon, I think "rang like a bell" has a literal connotation. 

Hmm, let me try to be as clear as possible. The body you are in now is actually a physical projection from a different state, ..though it's not so much a state as it is a different area of our consciousness.  The only difference between your waking and dreaming self is that while waking we separate from that area of dreaming. And in doing so project a dream reality apart from it. The key to understanding our planets and moons and space in general is that it is a reflection of our focus. As we are projecting into this dream we agree on a focus. A template. A model. And this 'entering into' as a focus here, during that entering the focus adopts the model and projects it as a reality. So when most think of planets having an effect on us, or that they were the results of God's or scientific Theories... that is the complete opposite of what is actually happening. The human consciousness is reflecting itself as a layered reality.  Dense physical waking self in one area, and then light astral body dreaming self, or space, as another layer of consciousness.

Many. Go up in the thread I'm on mobile 

 

Well, we and the people a couple thousand years before and after us...?

Only as far as solar eclipses are concerned. 

Yes, this is pretty similar to theists saying that the low odds of our planet being in the goldilocks zone is proof of a designer. 

A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

Perhaps even evolution isn't happening by chance. It could be that all of reality, including all of nature is communicating with itself on a quantum level in closed systems - thus creating grounds for an intelligent evolution, with intelligent mutations, not entirely random ones. One where "Intelligent design" isn't done by a Deity, but by nature itself.This is supported by the /r/holofractal theory of the Universe (not yet validated by mainstream science and probably missing some parts and connections to make it so, but I do feel it is a step in the right direction).

I do understand evolution.  Be honest, the odds of life evolving on this planet or anywhere else in the universe are just as improbable as the uniqueness of our planet's moon.  Improbable but not impossible.  You should learn to appreciate that.  

>So because the Bible says the Earth is round even when everyone else thought it was flat. So the Catholic church figured if people realized it was flat they wouldn't believe in God so it started a conspiracy to this day to get more church members? Clearly all of this is created either way. Either we are creating this reality, or another entity is.That isn't my understanding. My impression from speaking with flat-earthers is that the bible says the earth is circular, but not "round" in the way you mean it. They all believe that the bible strongly implies that the earth is flat and round (circular). They believe that the push towards thinking the earth is a globe and could have formed naturally is specifically to make people believe that a god isn't required for the earth to exist, while a flat earth could not form naturally and is proof of gods design.Not that there aren't flat-earthers who aren't religious, but that's really been the only motive I've heard for this supposedly huge cover-up

Im a skeptic but I had fun going down this rabbit hole for a bit. I like to read about oddities in space but I dont seek them out much. The wall is certainly interesting 

Corporate espionage?

If that's true then what is Cosmic Background Radiation? 

So I've thought about this some and I have an admittedly probably stupid idea.  Mainstream physics: the edge of the universe is similar to an event horizon, and the schwarzschild radius of something with the mass of the estimated mass of the universe would be about the radius of the observable universemy madness: we are inside a black hole, collapsing.  The reason we see an expanding universe is simply that we perceive time as the direction where entropy increases.  It's arbitrary whether we are collapsing or expanding.

It's possible.

Absolutely.  I'm 35 and I'm already becoming a grumpy old man :D

I love moon mythology. I remember reading this YouTube transcription of Stichens Sumerian tablets, and how the Anunnaki were always enamoured by our moon. Perhaps they were amazed because they knew it was fake but they themselves didn't build it? Whoa dude.  Aliens upon aliens! That said, let's be scientific. If the moon IS FAKE, how can we test and prove it? Is it falsifiable? If we trace time back, can we figure out when the move actually arrived? I posted a thought earlier to wondering when our lunar eclipse used to PERFECTLY eclipse the sun? Is there something interesting about that date? If it was designed to perfectly eclipse, why? What technological advantage would that present? Perhaps it needs constant reorbiting to keep it in the perfect eclipse range but after its creators/operators left, it has been spiralling outwards ever since?  HOLY fucking shit... https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-solar-eclipse-coincidence/The last paragraph seems to indicate that TREX would have seen a full eclipse..... 50 million years from now we won't have total eclipses anymore.. Therefore it happened around 50 or 60 say million years ago.. Did the moon kill the dinosaurs? Yeah, lock me up I've officially gone insane lol

Spoiler Alert: It is ;)

> If I'm not mistaken Charon is the much larger of the twoYou are mistaken. >they both actually orbit around a point in space between themThat's because Charon is such a large moon, that it's fucking with Plutos position. 

> The reason it 'rings like a bell' is because it's composed of more solid, rigid materials, unlike the Earth, which is composed of materials that have far more moistureYou seem pretty certain of that, would you mind explaining where you get that from? Because the moon ringing is established fact. The composition would be based on a handful of moon rocks brought back. One seems far more reliable than the other. Don't take this as a personal attack but it sounds like you aren't willing to entertain the idea the moon is hollow despite compelling evidence that it is. Edit: You did post where you got that from, my mistake for not reading further down. However I read your pdf article. When we theorize the moon is hollow I think you misinterpret what we mean by hollow. It still has something it it's core, the mass in between the surface and the core is evidenced to be either hollow or honeycombed. There is still a core if course because there is still a magnetic field. In fact none of the sources you posted provide a reliable theory for the composition of the moon. That's because there isn't one. The conclusion of the article assumes the impact formation theory, which is in no way reliable or certain. In fact you might be interested to know that the only way the impact theory for the formation of the moon can be correct is if there was a second almost identical impact afterwards. Science based on assumptions is just that. Again, don't take this as a personal attack, it's not. But throwing shade around like;> but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollowWhen your conclusions are based on assumed theories you can't be certain of them. The attitude you are taking is kind of the opposite of the scientific process which you seem to champion so strongly.

Dude, I am not a physicist.  I got that from Wikipedia.  After reading some of the material linked, I gather the difference in density between the earth and the moon despite them being made up of the same material as the earth (theoretically, same materials would have the same density) tends to support the theory that the moon is hollow in the center.  But, if the moon was formed from less dense crust or mantle material and not the more dense iron that makes up the core of the earth, that could account for the difference in density.  Rather than a compact planet with a solid core surrounded by spinning molten metal, the moon is a loose collection of dust and debris held together by loose gravitational bonds making it less dense than earth.  Doesn't make it hollow.  Makes it less dense.  I'm not arguing the moon is hollow.  I'm just sharing information about the theory.

> original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feetA) how the hell would you know the original height to such a specific degree andB) I find no source saying it was that height, it just seems to be convenient to your next equation rather than a representation that's accurate.  According to wikipedia it was 480.6 ft. 

Did they use miles and feet at this time?  I like your theory but i wonder if this would still work in the measuring units of their time.

>The dimensions of the Giza pyramid correspond to dimensions of our planet and the moon at a scale of 1 to 432,000. The sun has a radius of 432,000 miles.How does the pyramid correspond to the the Earth and the Moon at the same scale? It doesn't.>original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feetBest idea for the original height is 480.6 feet or 280 Egyptian cubits480.6 * 432,000 = 207619200 = 39321.8181818 miles >3,938.685 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 11 miles, or an error of about 0.2%)39321.8181818 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 35372 miles or an error of about 90%) you'll probably have to add some crap about ratios or factors in there.You might as well use the real numbers.  Also love the how the pyramid is accurate to 4 decimal places but you're happy to use 432,000 instead of 432287.938 which is the Suns actual radius in miles and good to let slide errors in measuring the polar radius.  Could that be because none of your magic maths would work otherwise?

Fun fact / Maybe we're going too far : the A note used to be 432 hertz before we set it up to 440 relatively recently

Yeah man, I was just enjoying some kooky dooky arguements about the Cloud People, and wherever the fuck the moon came from. Now its ruined by some asshole shoving his randomly quoted text down my throat like it's a 'balloon' that Bill Clinton expects on his birthday. I can bring him up because hes a mind controlled puppet of the Illuminati hell bent on keeping their position of slave masters on this prison we call 'Earth'

I have a pretty damn good telescope, and I can tell you for a fact there is not 'greenery' on the moon.

Those are indeed strange facts. Since most think the moon is a dead/natural satellite.But all of those things listed have been proven as fact. Most back in the 70s. But you see them crop through the news now and again as they are "rediscovered"

I love the idea of flipping everything we know around, because all I feel they need is hidden tech, and they can tell all the lies they want. I know it's not healthy to always think the world is against you, but it helps when you remember it's all of us regular (if you don't want me grouped with you that's cool) people against the ambiguous "them".But I take breaks here and there and enjoy time with friends to solidify myself here and not lose grip.Strange times ahead for sure. 

Not gonna lie this is kind of unnerving 

Crow is a fraud that manufactured those "waves."

Phobos is little more than very large rock. It's about the length of Manhattan. Gravity is near enough to nil that anything living on it would be better off just living in zero-g. 

There are many good leads but this is probably not one of them.  Look up how they "de-spin" rockets which normally spin in order to maintain some orientation.  Absolute linear speed changes are not going to be easy detect with no reference frame.

I'm unconvinced.How does field rotation correlate with a phenomenon that appears to track across the visible moon both before and after the field of view pans?If you feel field rotation is enough then perhaps you can break down how it caused the specific observed effect even after the pan, addressing each of these points:1. The telescope captures a "wave" apparently between the moon and the telescope lens propagating at a constant speed and direction.2. The telescope is panned such that the "wave" is out of the visible frame.3. The "wave" catches up with the visible frame, re-entering from the bottom edge where we would expect it to be if the camera had not panned, and then continues at the same constant speed and direction until reaching the top edge of the moon.

I thought a chap in Germany had independently verified his observation?This is a relatively new phenomenon. I'm open-minded about waiting for more evidence. I'm not saying it's real, but to say outright that it's a fraud is a conclusion without evidence too.

Following Occam's razor, it's much more likely to be atmospheric.

> Not that the moon is hotthe temperature on the surface of the moon hit by the sun can reach over 250¬∞F

Believe in things that can produce results. I 'believe' in many aspects of science because they produce direct, observable results. As for the moon being a hologram? Makes no sense, how could we predict tides if the moon didn't have mass. Moon bases and moon settlements/cities? I doubt it just like everything else. Extraordinary claims, extraordinary evidence, etc. but I don't dismiss it, because I have no way to know one way or the other. 

Either this guy is close to the 'source' or a mad man. Either way, massive respect.

consider things as probability/possibility. belief is a tough one. you can have faith in a thing. apply the sceintific method to a thing. things are harsh. learn as much as you can. it always pays off. 

But believing that you don't believe is itself a belief.

Seems like the safest route for now.

This is hardly meant to be a conclusive argument, but the reason the waves appear chaotic above asphalt is the proximity of high heat makes a lot of displacement waves in the air, which collide into the chaos we're used to seeing. At higher altitudes, few waves would be generated and are less likely to collide, so it's possible to see it keep a consistent angle and velocity.Source: B.S. in physics and a lot of recent experience with wave/sound mechanics

Yea, and I can't find decent information on it.  I want to study the virtual reality aspect of reality or at least things like the moon.I don't know anything about Antarctica other than they seem to be pretty secretive over that place.I can't figure out what the reasoning would be by tricking people it's round if it's flat though.  Even if it is flat, what does that really change or matter?  

[Is this it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZD2STt_OU)

Nonsense.  BBC licensing agreements with YouTube doesnt mean shit.  You can still read the papers these scientists wrote.  Why not just send them an email?

Tbh I think its most likely an artifact of digital recording. It would constantly be refreshing the contrast between the white and the black- i.e, the edge.  Does anyone have footage of this shot with a non-digital film camera? Have these things been seen with the human eye or is it just something that happens if you zoom a digital camera at the moon long enough ?

It *doesn't* follow the curvature. It's more pronounced on the vertical side of the moon and by the time it gets to the top horizontal line it's imperceptible , and *doesn't* come back down the other side. That's exactly what I'd expect if a ripple was moving from down to up in the atmosphere between the observer and the moon.

Cameras are the root of all conspiracies.

 

the entire "sky" is fake. there is no "outer space" in this simulation.

well said. 

So who or what are other people? If their real, why doesn't their dream focus affect my dream too? 

 

How is that? Firstly, the odds aren't really that low, and secondly, that would mean that even if it is low, it's still probable without a creator. 

If a higher dimension entity isn't a designer that how is this being created, by our own minds?  Lol I wonder if Mario and Luigi are atheists. 

Eh that's different though since life should only likely observe itself to be in a place that is suitable for life to be. So like, while our planet is certainly extremely rare it should be extremely common that any life that exists exists in the rare suitable places for it.The eclipse lining up at the same time humans start recording history has no obvious necessity.

The usual argument for this is like the anthropic principle.  The planets where it didn't happen there is no one to complain about it, the odds of us being on a planet where we evolved are 100%.  The moon isn't like that.  Some aspects of it might be, such as stablizing the axis of rotation and the climate stablity that comes with that.  The convenient eclipse size is just fun though.  It's proportionally much larger than moons around other planets.  And it's not a uniform density either, attempts to orbit probes very closet to the surface failed due to anomalies in the gravitational field much larger than anywhere on earth.  I don't know about the "moon wave" thing, this is the first time I saw that.

as a christian, that sounds absolutely ridiculous. you might as well say the Earth is actually a square as "proof" of intelligent design

I don't mean a perfect circle.  I need to check that thread on how many people do believe the Earth is flat.We can go to the "edge" if that's the case ourselves.  No one is guarding the entire edgle.  It's just 1000's of years this conspiracy has gone on with no one messing up.  We go into space and take pictures of the moon, and from satellites.  I hope we all know even if we didn't go to the moon we were in space near it.  I think they walked on the moon.

No, the Bible supports a round Earth that isn't at the center of the Universe.  I can get the scripture.  I just went through a lesson on this.

Makes sense to me 

anything is possible

it has been, mainstream science has blacklisted alien/religious theorist's and tons of these theorists have said this, any evidence they find is usually laughed off, and often only published on websites like this or personal websites, and if you ask most informed people, which I've done, and probably shouldn't have because it's done wonders for my reputation i'm sure, they'll tell you how obvious it is that most mainstream scientists won't even humor alternative science, only doing so when it gets popular. 

The Moon is a pretty deep rabbit hole :). And it leds you down the path of realising that we know almost nothing about cosmology, and that most of our theories on it are at odds with new data almost on a monthly basis. Personally I'm convinced the Moon isn't real in the sense it is an organicly occurring satellite, I believe it was very much put there, by whom I can't be sure. A shower thought I had the other day was that if there is a malignant alien presence exerting an influence over our species, and IF there is a galactic council or something similar trying to do something about it, it would make sense that the Moon being the craft the malignant aliens came here on would give them some sort of insurance against the tampering of their affairs but other species. "Hey you, stop messing with the humans and leave their world!", "Sure bro, we'll just take the Moon with us", "But that would be catastrophic!" "Then I guess stay out of our business."Not saying that's what I believe, just a thought I had ;).

This is a sadly underrated critique. 

no they used cubits

the distance of 1 KM is still the same amount of distance if measured in Miles, but the numbers are different because each unit of measurement is in comparison to a control. Every measurement is just measuring the variance from the original control object. 

Upvoted for the kooky dooky 

But not the other half of the moon.

>>But all of those things listed have been proven as fact. Most back in the 70s. Any sources? Proven facts are documented.

um, can you show me any of those 4 things?

Did the 10 other people who caught them manufacture the exact same thing also?

Millions of astronomers over thousands of years and the first dude to observe this is a flat earther?Gimme a break. Obvious fraud.

Crow's videos were shared with the fine people studying atmospheric optics over at /r/atoptics and opinion was that the video was fraud or possibly a contrail.  No one else observes this phenomenon.https://www.reddit.com/r/atoptics/comments/4nxmwl/can_anyone_help_identify_what_is_causing_this/

true, i don't even really believe that

Yep.

if it were an artifact of digital recording the wave would likely move or change in state if the camera panned.  If you look at the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM&app=desktop) he shows footage of the wave not moving with the camera as he pans quickly, and follows it's original trajectory as if unaffected by the camera itself.

Good point

Why do you insist on misquoting me?  LOL.  Conspiratards will tell any lie to support their delusions. 

I need to get a USB camera.  Mine hooks up to my laptop and I can get it on my screen.  I'll definitely record hours of footage.  I looked for aliens for years and all I've ever seen is satellites.  On my space forum 1000's of people who are experts (with telescopes, ones 30 feet tall some have built) all say they have never seen anything weird about the moon, any planet, or seen any UFO's.  

apparently people have only captured 11 waves so far on footage. and some occur near equinoxes or during lunar eclipses

 

It does. We all ripple out. Everything we do or believe , our thoughts, mental energy travels invisibly all around us, and we are in a sense biological antennae receiving it, and projecting it. Collectively we agree on what objects and forms will hold all the energy constantly overflowing from each person in this reality. The Sun is powered by us ,by our energy.  The moon itself is a symbol of night, of dreams.  we all agree on what we dream together, and the forms this will take.

Other people are their own consciousness. You or I are individual. You talking to me is your creation. Me talking to you is my creation. We each create our reality, but we cooperate. Just like we are doing. Only we also cooperate in ways we take for granted. Like we agree to agree there is a sun over our head and a moon trailing behind it. It's automatic, the stuff we take for granted is an automatic agreement. 

 

I don't think it's a valid argument, I was making the comparison to say that I don't think astronomical coincidences (size and position of Earth, of the moon and so on) are very meaningful. It's like a lottery in which each ticket has an equal and vanishingly small chance of winning but there must be a winner. Given that we have a moon it has to be one distance from the earth or another. Seeing its current position as somehow too "perfect" to be accidental is a very human-centric position. 

A common thought is that Antarctica is actually a seawall all around the flat earth that is a circle shape.  This would explain the reason why all countries have forbidden Antarctic exploration on a mass scale. Then a dome, "the firmament", encloses our atmosphere.  The firmament is in Genesis. 

nobody goes to space, all photos and videos are fake

Link please.

Kinda hexagonal shaped. And there are other shapes that look like they could have been buildings. But this sounds like a very harsh environment, to harsh for life to exist. The spaceship theory was fun too, but I think we know enough about the make up of Ipateus to know that's not very likely either. But Im open for discussion, whats your theory if you think these were built? Why? or what purpose do they serve? 

That's nonsense and you know it. 

I second this.  I watched a presentation of his a few years back, thinking that it'd just be some more hollow earth ridiculousness.  I did not expect to be convinced, but it was solid, well reasoned, and not full of the esoteric imaginative gibberish that most hollow earth stuff has.

I'm reading this after I finish my current book, pretty excited for it haha

"but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollow."Thought we were discussing "theories" here?   In discussing the theory we need to look at the origin of the theory and what information supports that theory.  Then analyze it, talk about how or why people may use it to support their belief.  I know what the moon is made of.  I can Google scientific papers all day long.  That's not what I want to do.  I want to find new rabbit holes to run down and look at the origins of some of these more "nonsensical" theories.  But no.  You come in here all Logical and link all your "peer reviewed" research from accredited publications.  Great.  Thanks.  You've ruined this for me.  

They used cubits and other things I can't remember the names of... furlongs? Idk, but the thing is, the units weren't standardized; like a master mason might have his set of measuring sticks passed down from his father who he apprenticed under, and maybe even his grandfather etc, but his would be slightly different than another masons tools although they would both measure a cubit. It wouldn't really matter, as long as they stick with one per structure so it has standardized units of measurement throughout; it would be a pain in the ass to renovate a building you didn't originally build though... Anyways, my point is that it would be damn near impossible to align structures to true north or whatever down to the last micrometer like people insinuate when they talk about these things when everyone is essentially using a unique measurement unit, I'd assume that they're pretty damn close but not perfect.

So you think there are green (read about chlorophyll) plants on the *dark side* of the moon?  You understand why that wouldn't make sense, right?

No, because there arent ten other people.Thousands of years of Astronomy and one dude observes this phenomenon and no one else? Lol

It doesn't matter what he believes. The video evidence stands on its own, until it is properly debunked. His personal views don't change the footage, and trying to discredit that evidence just because you disagree with him on other things is pretty closed minded.

Ah interesting, I thought you meant fraud as in the moon is a fraud.  He claims some of the videos are from other people but who knows if that's true

Sad, wonder why there used to be so much activity and now almost nothing. There are some theories saying they camouflage themselves somehow, need IR camera and stuff like that.But I suppose who knows at this point, you could make a bunch of theories up from that, maybe they're grouping up somewhere, preparing?Wishful thinking I know, besides we have those who believe they are demons. 

I fully understand what the terminology means. The Matrix is way over populated. It is also not mega advanced tech wise. Some people who have a NDE can clearly see the "White Light" at death is completely staged and somewhat synthetic and even crappy. People all over the world have been experiencing "Glitches In The Matrix". From identical people, cars, locations and objects completely respawning, to the projection actually freezing and the characters and objects around them staying in place for numerous seconds.

It's a bit tautological too. If it wasn't "perfect" (e.g. close enough to evolve life that can get intelligent), we wouldn't be here to realize it. 

But how is it too perfect? Why would it being seemingly the same size as the sun in our sky bare any real significance? What does factthat solar eclipses happen sometimes actually change in our lives, other than a few moments to go "oooo". The moon could be a different size or distance and tides would still happen, which is a much more significant phenomena to aid the growth and spread of life than eclipses. 

if i thought it was nonsense, i wouldn't have said it, and if your counter is just calling me delusional or crazy that's not an argument. Call me stupid all you want but mainstream everything, from politics to science is constantly caught cheating, lying, stealing, and blackmailing as well as blacklisting things they don't like, only people who don't like the truth blindly believe they don't exclude narratives  they don't like. 

yeah, i researched hollow theory quite a bit and did a presentation on it for my chemistry class for a pseudoscience assignment. it actually stirred my curiosity on to look into other "conspiracies." my conclusion is that until we have the technology to dig past our crust, we'd have to rely on assumptions given through how the seismic data is interpreated 

> Thought we were discussing "theories" here? In discussing the theory we need to look at the origin of the theory and what information supports that theory. Then analyze it, talk about how or why people may use it to support their belief.There is no evidence that supports the moon being hollow, that is my point.> I know what the moon is made of. I can Google scientific papers all day long. That's not what I want to do. I want to find new rabbit holes to run down and look at the origins of some of these more "nonsensical" theories.Again, that's fine, just don't pretend they are legitimate.> Thanks. You've ruined this for me.Good, people need to spread actual knowledge rather than nonsense, otherwise we'll keep coming closer to a modern version of the Dark Ages ...

[Holy moly.  It's  not literally dark, dude.  It's tidally locked & we only ever see one side.  The moon has days and nights, just like us.](http://earthsky.org/space/five-myths-about-the-moon)  #5

I don't think so, but no one from earth's perspective ever sees the dark side of the moon.

Uh I'm reading the book and so far all I can find is that he's citing other books, namely  Jessup, Morris K. (1957). The Expanding Case for the UFO. New York: Citadel PressandStrange World of the Moon - 1962 (by VA Firsoff)Neither of these are in print.Swann refers to Firsoff as a top scientist and authority on the moon. This seems to a be a pretty strong embellishment based on what can be found about the man.MK Jessup is a better known ufologist who was at one point a PhD candidate but it's not clear that he ever finished his degree or worked in science in any capacity after that point.I'd say this is a pretty weak source overall.

Try thinking.  Maybe the wave wasn't there thousands of years ago.  Maybe they didn't have high def cameras.Try checking before making a blatantly false statement.  This video shows 10 wave captures by people around the world.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM

Do you really think that after thousands of years of observations only Crow77 has ever observed this phenomenon?Do you simply believe every video you see, even when that video contradicts the personal observation of BILLIONS of humans over thousands of years?Dude, think. Obviously fraud. 

It isnt true.  No one else observes this phenomenon. 

Word for word?  Read it again if you can actually read, which is doubtful. 

I'm highly confident the "aliens" are fallen angels/demons.  I've had a lot of contact with them since age 14 when it started.  I brought a demon back from Peru and it will tell me it's name if I ask.  It possessed me and I started stabbing myself with the Peruvian knife (turns out it's the Peruvian God of war carved on the knife and they pray over it).

 

/r/glitch_in_the_matrix

its a bit far-reaching for me, but there are footage of planes stopping in the middle of air for a brief second before continuing. or planes simply vanishing like someone turned off a hologram

Been fun larping w/ u

It's not tautological at all... cogito (or in this case, typito) ergo sum.I'm here, and no matter your belief in a fancy-shmancy CIA holo-projected universe, I really did type this, and this planet *is* a Goldilocks planet.And the chance that non-pernicious info is folded into every single species' DNA quadrillions of times, with a way to circumvent RNA's non-conforming-therefore-discarded policy is a number so large that it would require every molecule in the universe to count it out on a cosmic abacus.

Maybe it was created by people for people to wonder at, to block out the sun and show a display of power. IDK why you would involve religion/creationism at all unless that was your own neurosis.

Well their argument, which I think is fallacious, is that if quite a few of the conditions on earth weren't *exactly* as they are, we wouldn't be here. That may be true but all it means is that something else would be here. There's obviously no basis to believe someone or something arranged it this way to suit us. The argument seems to be assuming that there is something essential about human life and a universe without us would be a pointless mistake. 

>  if your counter is just calling me delusional or crazy that's not an argument. Call me stupid all you want   I didn't call you any of those things, but if you insist let's go ahead and put this to the test.   Show me one of these papers published on a website that was rejected from peer reviewed journals, which has empirical evidence of the Moon's atmosphere supporting liquid water and greenery. All it would take is a few spectroscopic measurements, anyone with access to a telescope and some basic equipment can carry that out and publish their data, so where is it? 

During the Dark Ages they burned people as witches because they believed the earth circled the sun and not the other way around.  It was literally a period in history where discussing science, alternative theories of evolution, cosmology and mathematics could get you killed.  New ideas, new belief systems were harshly and violently suppressed.  If anything is dragging us back to the Dark Ages, it's people like you who refuse to even discuss a different point of view.  

Huh. Fair point.  Now can you suggest any reason why only the side we can't see would have vegetation?

Why do you need a camera? Because you cant fake waves on the actual moon, but you can on video.All these "waves" are all in the same video released by the same person, lol You are being duped by someone that pushes pseudoscience to get subscriptions.  

LOL I am still laughing about this.  Where are the source videos, Crow?  I cant believe you took that video seriously.

I'm not saying you're wrong. You could be right.Where is it implied or suggested that this phenomenon is "thousands of years old?" For all we know this was first observed in the last few years because that's when it started. What evidence do you have for a fraud, other than an absence of evidence for it being a real phenomenon? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.I'm not suggesting anything, just pointing out what we can all see on the video. If you can explain how to achieve these effects within the constraints and also explain how a third party independently observed them from a different location, with separate evidence for it, then we can call it debunked and carry on with our lives. 

Good to know, thanks!

I'm still open to entertain that idea, but there's also the possibility of that kind of thing being a "distraction" or "misinfo". I just honestly don't know what to give more credence to.  The beings could be friendly and trying to help, but "they" don't want that, so they're demons or malevolent aliens. But on the flip side, they could be evil aliens or demons sure, and the people shouting the benevolent aliens idea could be trying to get us to trust these beings who mean harm. I'm just anxious about the future and hoping this is all coming to a culmination, but I know there have been others like me waiting for an "event" as well and they've died with nothing occurring. Let's hope there's something to this "Great" Eclipse and the 23rd that follows.EDIT: I also mean to try more psychedelics hopefully in the nearby future, I want to see what my consciousness has to say about all the information I have cooped up in there. 

Part of the fun of r/conspiracy is entertaining the possibility. Or at least it used to be. 

Got any links?

factthat we have DNA is statistically slim?  What?  I need more info.

But what I'm saying is why would anyone who would create the moon need to make it so eclipses are present. It has no real baring on how life came to be. 

Not to further an argument that I also find fallacious, but it isn't just conditions on earth.  All of the constants in the universe (Speed of light, etc.) are so perfectly tuned that if they were changed by on millionth of a percent matter itself could not exist.  It's pretty mind blowing.

oh, i don't believe the moon is hollow, or supports greenery, i'm insane, not delusional, yet, and it's fairly well admitted i believe that the moon has ice on it, you can literally just type in 'moon has ice?' i'm too lazy too bother, and drunk, but the liquid water thing is probably bull, although looking it up on google search brings up lots of times mentions of water vapor, so there might be a little. don't see what difference it makes. 

> During the Dark Ages they burned people as witches because they believed the earth circled the sun and not the other way around.Yup, and people today are still stoned to death, and there were death camps in the 1990s ... we're not so far from history.> It was literally a period in history where discussing science, alternative theories of evolution, cosmology and mathematics could get you killed. New ideas, new belief systems were harshly and violently suppressed. If anything is dragging us back to the Dark Ages, it's people like you who refuse to even discuss a different point of view.A completely discounted, illogical and nonsensical point of view.  It's this kind of 'science sliding' that leads to the coal lobby and other anti-scientific scam artists to hold so much power, they take advantage of people who just want to "discuss a different point of view" and allow it to grow into a powerful minority which ultimately profits only a select few ...

Well, that's probably pretty unlikely.  It has been shown that our moon has a trace atmosphere, iirc from impacts and outgassing, but it's  pretty close to a vacuum.  There  is ice on the moon, and a trace of water vapor, and the moon is capable of holding a breathable atmosphere for (I  think) thousands or tens of thousands of years.   And there are Apollo images that look like liquid water, and are kind of tough to explain away, but I would bet they are something else like impact glass or some other substance.   The moon is a trippy place.**But do I think the other side has air and vegetation?  No.**   I just like to pipe up when someone is thinkng the moon has a perpetually night side.  Space is so freaky and counter-intuitive that I don't  judge ignorance or superstition or conspiracy theories. 

Ok you have no idea what you're talking about.  It's been captured over a dozen times, from multiple states and countries.  But you stay ignorant in your brain cage of rigid skepticism so closed off you cant even learn anything new.

seriously , people get so angry 

Blocking out the sun is a pretty badass thing to do? There's different degrees of significance between Complete Coincidence and Created by God. Maybe the Face on the Moon is actually there and it was to show an ancient civilisations perceived mastery over nature.

There are so many "coincidences" that it almost feels natural, you know what I mean. The fibonacci sequence and Pi happening so often in nature is mindblowing. 

Liquid water and greenery was the specific claim that I was refuting at the top of this comment thread. You were seemingly defending that point when you responded to my request for a citation.

Ohhh, son, that's a big leap to suggest discussing reasons why people might believe the moon is hollow will lead to an unregulated coal industry.I get what you're saying, but I don't think you stuck the landing there.  

 

> I just like to pipe up when someone is thinkng the moon has a perpetually night sideYes, this was a pretty stupid assumption on my part.  I can easily model it in my mind and see why it isn't the case.  I just always took the name at face value I guess.  It was an interesting lesson in my own ignorance.Edit:  For instance, solar eclipses exist.  I can be astoundingly stupid sometimes =)

Apollo? We never went to the moon

Then why is your only evidence a single video?

This isn't supposed to be fun this is a fevered rush for the truth 

Stick your thumb out and cover the sun, are you now a badass?

I think these things tend to lend credence to the idea of us living in a simulated universe.

yeah, i'm slowly getting more drunk, and honestly i don't really care about this anymore, i had to go over this statement like 3 times for errors, so have a good night, don't go to bed angry 

> Ohhh, son, that's a big leap to suggest discussing reasons why people might believe the moon is hollow will lead to an unregulated coal industry.I think both prey on the same types of mindset.> I get what you're saying, but I don't think you stuck the landing there.Certainly a stretch, but I do believe there is a significant 'trickle-down' effect when it comes to believing things for which there is no evidence.

Absolutely.

Pink Floyd didn't  help much.  ;)

[Oh, sure.   That's  what **they** want you to think...](https://youtu.be/ZNIFyy3i_1I?t=47s)

Well no because it only effects me from my perspective lol. If i had a giant thumb and blocked out the sun for this hemisphere it would be seen as badass by some people. Especially if they worshipped the sun.

Yes, but to be fair, I was a badass before doing so.

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

If we continued to simply accept what is known and proven, there's no impetus to discover new things.Liiiiike, alternative fuels that might replace coal and other polluting fossil fuels.  

Ha ha looks like fun

> Well no because it only effects me from my perspective lol.Exactly.

> If we continued to simply accept what is known and proven, there's no impetus to discover new things.I'm not saying that we should only accept what is known and proven, I'm saying that once a theory has reached a point that there is zero evidence to support it and there are mountains of evidence against it, then it should be treated as such.

Supposedly pretty crappy, but I like the idea.

Yes, exactly, putting my thumb out to cover the sun does only effect my perspective. Are you using that as a metaphor or something?

Everything is just relative to where you are. Just like you and your thumb, that's sometimes the moon and the planet. 

Yep, nice metaphor.

Kudos to whoever came up with these round tables, they're great.

There's a lot more interesting things about the moon's dimensions as well, much of which was known by ancient monument builders who made the pyramids at Giza as well as Stonehenge and many other sites.For example, the ratio of the Earth's diameter to the Moon's diameter is 11:3, or 7920:2160 miles. This ratio produces a phenomenon known to ancient geometers as squaring the circle. If you made a circle with a radius of the Earth's radius, plus the moon's radius, then that circle would have the same perimeter as a square drawn around the Earth:http://joedubs.com/squaring-the-circle/Basically, if the Moon were touching the Earth, then you could draw a circle with it's center at the center of the Earth, and it's edge passing through the center of the Moon, and that circle would have the same length around it's edge as a square perfectly enclosing the Earth. This relationship is illustrated in the great pyramid at Giza in the ratio of its height to its square base, and in the concentric rings at Stonehenge.This relationship would not be there if either the Earth or the Moon were a little bit bigger or smaller, and is even more amazing when you realize the significance of measuring these dimensions in miles. The ancient approximation of pi‚âà~~11/7~~ 22/7 is reflected in the radius of this large circle encompassing the Earth and the Moon with radius 5040 miles, or 7! (7x6x5x4x3x2x1) and the diameter of the Earth (or one side of the square) with length 7920 miles, or 11!/7! (11x10x9x8). So whoever came up with the measurement of the mile clearly had this relationship in mind.There's even more significance when you start to look deeper into the cosmic patterns of the universe, but the moon is just the start. Our ancient ancestors who designed not only the length of the mile, but also the foot, meter and cubit had these cosmic dimensions and ratios as their basis, as explained so well by Alan Greene, who recently did an AMA. True, the moon is amazing, but once you start to study the deeper patterns in the cosmos and the sacred geometry all around us in nature, it becomes clear that the moon is simply one of many amazing "coincidences" of proportion that seem too perfect not to be designed. My personal feeling is that the underlying structure of our universe itself is beautiful, fractal harmonic relationships, and as a result, everything in the manifest world reflects that.

I put this thread together for /r/conspiracy a few years back:[A Little List of Coincidence in the Solar System](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ugs5u/a_little_list_of_coincidence_in_the_solar_system/): Space, Geometry and the Golden Section. Do the planets hide a secret Harmony of the Spheres?

I love space related conspiracy. Great topic. 

Astronomer [Tom Van Flandern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Van_Flandern) and others have argued that there used to be a large planet between Jupiter and Mars (where the asteroid belt is today). Mainstream science doesn't entertain this possibility because there isn't a natural mechanism for the literal "explosion" of an entire planet.Van Flandern, undeterred, traced back the paths of scores of comets in our solar system, and discovered that many converged at the same time, and at the same location, at two points in the history of our solar system, with the most recent being approximately 2 million years ago. Other writers like Joseph P. Farrell (in his book *The Cosmic War*) offer a *technological* explanation for this major event, namely that this large, potentially earth-like object was *deliberately* destroyed, and even more hypothetically by a weaponized moon in our solar system.Van Flandern took it even further by speculating that "the origin of the human species may well have been on the planet Mars, which he believed was once a moon of a now-exploded "Planet V"."In support of this theory, some ancient cultures have lore that tells of ancient humans originating on Mars.If this interests anybody, I highly recommend reading *Dark Matter, Missing Planets & New Comets* by the late Van Flandern. He has an entirely new approach to gravity that honestly is quite stunning in its simplicity and implications.

The Hollow Phobos Hypothesis has significant evidence to back it up, which is a problem because, paraphrasing Carl Sagan, there isn't an accepted *natural* explanation for a hollow planetoid.[The Phobos Monolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_monolith) is also the subject of significant speculation.There has also been a curious history of failing equipment each time we get close to this enigmatic moon...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon)#Shklovsky.27s_.22Hollow_Phobos.22_hypothesis

One thing I often wondered about was the difference between the Earth's 24hr day and our biological 25hr clock (put people in a room containing no natural light nor clocks, and they will naturally have 25hr sleep/wake cycles.)  What if some time ago the earth had a 25hr day, and some astronomical event slowed it down.  That would explain why our clock is off.  But when did it happen, and was the moon involved?

The one that I find most interesting is John Brandenburg and the evidence for prehistoric global nuclear warfare on Mars.  [Death on Mars by John Brandenburg](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Mars-Discovery-Planetary-Massacre/dp/193914938X)[Gordon White interviews Brandenburg on the skeptiko podcast](http://skeptiko.com/john-brandenburg-outsourced-ufo-research-325/)  [The first sentence on the Brandenburg page at rationalwiki:](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/John_Brandenburg) John E. Brandenburg is a plasma physicist who went somewhat off the rails in 2012 and started proclaiming that he saw clear evidence of a thermonuclear war on Mars in the distant past.

Let's try to factor in those [moon "wave" anomalies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVm99ur5lg) in here also.  Because to me, it looks like a hologram that's refreshing or something.  And no, it's not the camera or an artifact, that's been debunked multiple times.

The Moon has 99% been a part of (or in the vicinity of) Earth since it's formation. The decay of the Helium isotopes matches up which means that the Helium atoms on Earth and the Helium atoms on the Moon have been close to each other since just about their formation. Another way of putting it is that both sets of Helium have experienced the same amount of time in the universe, which can only mean that they have travelled together. This is all pretty concrete and is the reason why the impact hypothesis is the currently accepted theory.UNLESS, the moon landings never happened and the "Moon Helium" is in fact terrestrial. 

Ah, classic /r/conspiracy. How much I have missed you and these threads. I love you guys. :) 

I don't believe this enormous 'tower' photographed by the Soviets in 1965 was ever explained https://www.reddit.com/r/UnexplainedPhotos/comments/47upry/the_mysterious_tower_on_the_far_side_of_the_moon/Is it a glimpse into the far side of the moon?

I just had a random thought, what if the total eclipse on August 21st will be used to implement some form of Project Blue Beam? EVERYONE will be looking at the sky in the states...

The secret is the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Look at Tethys and Minas's heat signatures, what does pacman eat? Ghosts.

Is it possible that because of the sheer size of everything, that there is a "zone" in which the moon could reside to give us the same eclipse effect?  I've heard astronomers describe it like if the moon were 100 miles nearer or further it wouldn't give the same effect.

Here's a conspiracy that will be hated. Maybe there is a god/creator of the universe. And this planet is perfectly designed to support life?

The moon is 400 times smaller than the sun while being 400 closer to the earth than the sun, giving us perfect solar eclipses. That's pretty convenient.

Here is something relevant I posted a couple weeks ago. **NASA VIDEO EVIDENCE of the astronauts faking shots of "Earth at a distance" during the Apollo missions, while they were still very much in low Earth orbit.**Because once you realize that we may have never passed LEO, questions about the moon become much more valid. Another angle of thought is that we went to the moon, found out something that was  too much to tell the public, so we filmed and faked an alternate moon reality (NASA's moon footage) and have been presenting that to the public ever since.______The following evidence represents an extremely important moment caught on camera that I believe has never been adequately addressed by NASA or any NASA supporter. In my opinion it is equivalent to what the ‚ÄúWTC7 collapsing‚Äù footage is to the 9/11 truth movement.It comes from the documentary ‚ÄúA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon‚Äù but I am not trying to convince anyone of anything from an obviously biased documentary. Be skeptical of all of it. I encourage that. When this clip plays in the documentary there is a narrator but, again, I am telling you to completely ignore that voiceover if it pleases you.Simply use your eyes and use your brain and look at what I am about to show you. I am purposely separating the most important footage from the documentary and its bias, muting the narrator, and breaking the clip up into very short digestible gifs. Lets start.Does this look like the Earth to you? Would you assume that this is a shot from the far reaches of space, looking back at Earth from a distance?http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-P6L-AaPretty convincing right? Lets look at more footage of ‚ÄúEarth at a distance‚Äù:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-2BRu4xZooming in the camera which we can only assume is pushed up against a shuttle window, pointed out at the Earth in the blackness of space:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-fnU3AeOkay, this shot is even better. Notice that you cannot really make out any continents? Notice that you see no stars? But for the sake of argument, lets just completely ignore that for now. Take a look:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-xaWNX2I mean, thats definitely the Earth right? And you would have to be far beyond Earth (on the way to the moon) to get footage like that, correct? Again, no recognizable continents, No stars. But again, for the sake of argument, lets allow science to explain that.But wait, how exactly does this happen? http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-TTDLgtWait, isn‚Äôt the camera pressed against the window and zoomed in? Because they are far from Earth right, at least this far, correct? If they zoomed that camera back out.http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-aRd5qGBut wait a minute, wtf is that? Is that the sun?http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-KRP8WaHold on. Wut? Here is a longer gif just to make the strangeness very clear.http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-pVgTUTIs that a‚Ä¶ work light? Of enormous size and floating in space?Wait a minute, whats going on? http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-0cFJWXReady to have your mind completely shattered? Look:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-H8tierSo wait, what? Yeah, that ‚ÄúEarth at a distance‚Äù was a clever camera trick. They used the circular shuttle window and the small part of the enormous Earth showing through that small circular window. Camera tricks and the illusion of a little ‚ÄúEarth ball‚Äù at a distance.As you can see here, they are very close to Earth. Like ‚ÄúLow Earth Orbit‚Äù close. And yes, that was a work light. You can now see it clearly. And that blackness was a darkened shuttle interior. Again:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-bXHv0J Or‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I am willing to entertain any ideas or thoughts on this.And let me set the record straight once and for all:Do you personally subscribe to any ‚ÄúFlat Earth‚Äù or ‚Äúalternate Earth models‚Äù?‚Äî NODo you believe in the ISS and Mars rover missions?‚Äî YESDo you believe that you can shine a laser at a retroreflector on the moon?‚Äî YES, because the unmanned soviet [Lunokhod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunokhod_programme) program left retroreflectors there.What about the other evidence: moon rocks, etc‚Ä¶?‚Äî I am not sure honestly, I do not feel like I have studied enough to make a decision.So what are you trying to prove then?‚Äî I am simply pointing out that there is unusual footage of what appears to be the astronauts filming a disingenuous ‚ÄúEarth‚Äù. I find the footage fascinating and would love to know more about it. I would love to see the unedited footage and I would love to see the extended footage.How do we know this is real NASA footage?‚Äî Because NASA included it in their Apollo 11 DVD set. Why, I don‚Äôt know. But people definitely thought that pointing that out would somehow make my brain stop comprehending what it saw.As a matter of fact, [here is a website that appears to be trying to debunk that footage](http://www.clavius.org/bibsibrel.html), scroll to the bottom.This is their explanation:_____What Mr. Sibrel supplies is footage of the astronauts practicing for an upcoming telecast. **Because television was added at the last minute, they hadn't had time to practice much with the equipment. So they were experimenting with different camera positions and exposure settings**. Someone on the ground recorded it. Mr. Sibrel notes several observations which he can't explain in terms of his expectations, therefore he concludes the astronauts "must" have been faking it. That's it. That's his "smoking gun."_____And finally, here is [the TIMESTAMPED section of ‚ÄúA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon‚Äù](https://youtu.be/xciCJfbTvE4?t=32m20s) if this post piqued your interest. Once again, take everything said by the narrator with a grain of salt. I am not trying to convince anyone of anything other than what their eyes see and the conclusions their brain reach while watching that particular footage that I made gifs from. I personally have a hard time wrapping my brain around what form of ‚Äúcontext‚Äù could possibly explain it. 

When the Earth was Moonless:http://www.halexandria.org/dward200.htm

The other day I was reading through this thread and someone linked to a story about NASA sending 2 secret Apollo missions to the moon who made contact and were murdered by an alien life form.But now I can't find it. Anyone help me out with a link?

Does anyone know for what purpose would people lie about the Earth being round?  I look at a lot of conspiracy theories but the flat Earth one kind of shows how easily it is to convince people of whatever you want.

Here's Richard Hoagland's article on Saturn's moon Iapetus:[A Moon with a View](http://enterprisemission.com/moon1.htm)Other researchers [have pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/246tud/you_can_relax_now_that_mysterious_equatorial/) that the massive and mysterious "equatorial ridge" around Iapetus has yet to be fully explained or understood, not to mention the abundance of seemingly organized geometric shapes on its surface.

Expanding on the "spaceship moon" hypothesis, writer Don Wilson has written several books on the subject.[Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon](http://www.cseti.org/Our%20Mysterious%20Spaceship%20Moon/coverpage.htm) is available to read online (I highly recommend it...I spent over $50 for a physical copy), as well as [Secrets of Our Spaceship Moon](http://auricmedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Don_Wilson_Spaceship_Moon.pdf) (pdf).Another popular book on this subject is [Who Built the Moon?](http://www.whobuiltthemoon.com/)

God I missed shit like this.

The Earth is a Black Dwarf Star (burned-down star) and all the elements present here were home-grown.[13 minute video from Bill Gaede](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fINLrXi54zA)

We are developing plans for catching asteroids and placing them into orbit around destination planets/moons for use of a depot station and middle ground in expeditions and resource harvesting.When I read this the moon made sense.  It's designed.  Perfect distance and rotational speed: always one side facing us.Pink Floyd must have known something.The topic of moon landing validity falls at the feet of the video proof.My grandfather was a mathematician for NASA and worked on the mission.  We definitely went there.My theory: the video is the original fake news.  What we discovered about or on the moon, it was decided, did not fit the narrative.If the moon was placed there... possibly as a depot station... by who?Anyone else got anything on this?The anunnaki and their desire for gold come to mind._orion

Electric universe theory

This is the shit that keeps me going 

 

So what's the deal with this force field I keep hearing about? A friend in person told me there might be a force field trapping everyone on Earth? Something about the Anunnaki using humans to try and break out of it

The Moon is an artificial object that was flown to it's current location.

[The ancient time on Earth without a Moon.](https://www.varchive.org/itb/sansmoon.htm). A Moon either being brought here or built here (by an advance Creator(s)) could explain the Great Deluge and the numerous underground dwellings and cities, among the other anomalies of the moon (ie size ratio to Earth, and the pefectness of all proportions - not to far, not to close - just right distance to the sun, etc etc). I have a wacky thought that maybe the souls of Humans (who do not ascend) pass through the hollow Moon, and those who do ascend pass through the Hollow Earth. Hence why they call people "lunatics" and why people act freaky during a full moon in the night (ie. the freaks come out at night).

Is this the round table? Or is this the announcement for round table coming?

Can someone smart tell me how rare it actually is that our moon fits in the sun? I personally am agnostic due to the insane amount of coincidences like this but I'd like to know this, because space is a very real and fact (math)-based science.Regarding this: >There is no astronomical reason why the Moon and the Sun should fit so well. It is the sheerest of coincidences, and only the Earth among all the planets is blessed in this fashion.

I really like this article that explains the craters on the moon:http://www.thunderbolts.info/webnews/120707electriccraters.htmElectric Universe all the way.

all 4 rocky planets (mercury, venus and mars) could haveonce hosted life. the secret is melting the core. you can do that by simply moving the planet closer to the sunand wait. once you melt the core you get a magnetic field.not only that, planets may be growing in size(look for the growingearth theory) if this is true. mercury may become the next venus.venus may become the next earth. and as we all know earth will be the next mars. the only planet we have left is mars. if we want to make it life supportive we need alien advance technology to move it wheremercury is now. the it will spin faster than it should (einstein solve this)and it may gain back its liquid core, magnetic field, grow a littlecover itself in hot magma, and the cicle continues. thats my theory. 

The moon is a Hollow Alien Spacecraft:1)http://www.disclose.tv/news/the_biggest_secret_of_our_solar_system_is_our_moon_an_alien_spacecraft/1365172)http://scariestbookofalltime.blogspot.com/2010/01/no-moon-prior-to-11713-years-ago.html

There is also the theory that Zecharia Sitchin puts forth, that the Moon was actually a satellite of a different planet. To parallel the Tiamat vs Marduk story.http://www.sitchinstudies.com/the-sumerian-solar-system.html

The moon fits perfectly into the sun. How could that be?  Very simple, the thinking about the moon needs to change, stop assuming it is a giant rock, planet, or whatever. Think of it as 'the back of the sun' or a projection created by the sun. They are, in fact, the same entity, but that doesn't mean the moon doesn't have unique properties, such as the ability to cool objects exposed to moonlight. It is not a "place" you can visit, but the sun itself reflected, somehow.

Probably should have called this thread "Strictly for Professional Lunatics" lolWe know other planets have moons, both in our own solar system as well as in other systems in our galaxy but absolutely none of them have a moon that is anywhere as big as ours is in comparison to the size of the Earth itself. So that presents a curious anomaly as well as raising an interesting question about how the Earth could have initially attracted and held on to such a large moon when we have no other planets with moons that come anywhere close to being as big as they themselves are as we do and probably shouldn't have been able to do in light of that. That of course leads to the question about what the Moon itself and it's interior is made of and all the conjecture surrounding whether it may actually be hollow or not. Another interesting consideration is whether or nor what we have called and believed to be "craters" produced by meteors, may have actually been the result of some kind of violent and gaseous volcanic activity in the moon's distant past which would look pretty much the same when you look at and think about it from that perspective. You might want to cook and pay attention to a pot of oatmeal to get yourself into the mood for that. lol

Nah.. I was expecting for Gobekli Tepe..

The moon is what causes tidal forces on the oceans and gravitational pull in the earths core thus keeping the planet alive. I wouldn't be surprised if the moon was the original Noah's ark. Sounds fucking crazy lol

The Moon is your yin self. It is ever-changing from full to transparent. It is equal in size to the Sun, your yang self. That Moon and that Sun are yours alone. Both are conceptual manifestations of you. Neither entirely exists physically. They are right above you, inside the dome, you are inside your very own plane-ette of experience. The Sun appears as your corona, where a single point of intention to exist meets infinite non-existent potential erupting in bright heated light. The Moon is infinite manifest non-existence, manifest as existence. You are in between your Sun and your Moon on a plane-ette of experience, where all you see or know is self overlain on infinite individualities. All you see or know is your self externalized onto infinity from within a time-space conceptualization that is designed to keep you individual and sane within an infinite non existent conception.

Great book alert for this topic:  "Who Built the Moon" by Alan Butler. YL;DR: great analysis arguing that our moon had to be built by some form of intelligent life.

This was a great discussion thank you. I look forward to the next one. 

> Saturn's moon Iapetus (the "Death Star") has also been the subject of some of this high octane speculationSo Revelation Space? (It's a good read, with this very concept) - In regards to Iapetus being hollow - the density is slightly higher than that of pure water ice. If it were hollow, it would need to be able to sustain the same mass/size ratio as though it were another iceball. Tethys is in this same density category, as are most small moons around Saturn, and its rings are all pretty much particles around that same density too. (hovering around 1 g/cm^3)So just remember folks - nature doesn't have an agenda the same way that human beings vying for power do. It can be tested and doesn't intentionally hide anything.Coming from a background in astronomy and working in geosciences department, researchers are just normal people who use software to build models. There's enough material online you can learn the science on your own and use the same Python libraries [used by professionals](http://www.astropy.org/) - And all public funded projects have public data after a set time. So go crunch the numbers! I think the most controversial work out there is in ETI detection from huge data sets. [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03031) is an interesting approach that needs a lot further work.Could it be hollow? Sure, but if you're looking for a juicy conspiracy, there's more than enough happening with the Deep State right now.

Topics in this sub have been bangers lately. Keep it coming. Links and all.

Why are we trusting science fiction writers to put something in the "best" way about a real celestial body?> In the 1970's, two Soviet scientists proposed an alternative theory: Earth's moon may be a hollowed out spaceship.How does that explain it's density?

I don't usually comment here, but I will in this instance. It is a spectacular coincidence that total solar eclipses can happen right when humans are alive. Millions of years from now, the Moon will be farther away from Earth. It gets about 4cm farther from Earth every year, so millions of years from now it'll be so far that it'll look smaller in the sky and won't be able to block all of the Sun's light. If you run this in reverse, that means the Moon was closer in the past. In the distant past it was in the same place as Earth, meaning it came from Earth. Giant impact is really the only logical explanation to these observationsEdit: letters

I follow suit with the ship hypothesis with a way out their notion. I think it is the key to reincarnation. Our consciousness is nothing more than the sun providing the energy to the moon. The farther(sun) provides the seed to the womb of the mother(moon), giving birth to the holy ghost(earth)

the amount of shills here is wild. you can tell we hit something with this talk. 

I think we went to the moon , but faked all the footage shown to the public. I just can't see our paranoid cold war government giving away anything that could have been a tactical advantage to the USA. You had this absolutely batshit crazy paranoia about communists and you want me to believe that we were just going give away information about out advanced space vehicles, lunar modules, first photos of the moon etc. to the "commies" .  This sort of explains the Kubrick theory, and all the fake moon rocks.

 

This is a globe.https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rqr3x/this_is_a_globe_re_rconspiracy_round_table_3_the/

Tethys and Minas are also death stars. EDIT: Look at their heat signature, pacman eats ghosts, death stars are stars of death....

The moon has an equal chance of or being a flat somewhat translucent disc. There is documented stars being seen through the unlit portion of the moon. We also know it is much smaller due to the shadow size being approx 70miles  in the upcoming eclipse.Interesting stuff, more interesting is that mainstreamed science won't touch this possibility. Likely to continue to cover up the moon landing hoax. 

there are lots of movies, songs and shows lately that speak about the end. it's well past 2012 so i don't think it has anything to do with that. i think something really is coming. kanye tried to tell people the truth recently and he got taken off to the hospital by handcuffs....bieber has been going to bible study and he cancelled his tour. idk. things just seem weird. i just heard harry styles song "sign of the times" and i can't get it out of my head. i know this is kind of off topic but predictive programming is 100% real and we need to talk more about it. 

well there's good 'evidence' of underground cavern systems on the moon but i like the idea it's a huge hollowed out space ship. Easy to test I guess with usa, china, russia, and everyone wanting to go there to exploit/ experiment/ prove concept. 

Breath of fresh air isn't it.

Whoever built the pyramids had a [clear understanding of the size of the earth and the moon.](http://blog.world-mysteries.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GreatPyramid_Blueprint.jpg) But what is astounding to me is that the earth and the moon are so perfectly balanced. Why did these ancient cultures [know the shape and size of these bodies thousands of years ago?](http://blog.world-mysteries.com/mystic-places/decoding-giza-pyramids-part-3/) And WHY do the Earth, Sun, Moon have these  [mathematic relationships?](https://i0.wp.com/joedubs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/108-Earth-Sun-and-Moon.jpg)[Here is some more interesting info](http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/2016/01/20/the-metre/) about our units of measurement and their relationships to the moon.Considering the moon is the ONLY moon that is perfectly round, faces its planet with the same side always, and is the PERFECT distance and size from the earth to eclipse the sun, it seems like the moon is the most likely candidate for an artificial satellite. But it still blows my mind as to HOW and WHY??There are harmonious mathematical relationships between many of the other planets as well. [Here's the astounding relationship between Earth and Venus.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFDBeTdPKig)And [here's another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcJiRmZ9WmY) that shows the relationships between all the other planets in the solar system.

This is an interesting relationship that I hadn't seen before. It's interesting except for one small detail. Pi is approximated as 22/7, not 11/7. 22/7 ‚âà 3.1428...

Thanks for this! Should be a great lead up to the eclipse in three weeks!!

Simulation theory confirmed!

Thank you very kindly for this information. Wonderful rabbit hole to delve into. And thanks for making sticky threads on topics that are considered as "fringe" as this one. Very refreshing to see on this sub (especially with all the politics garbage dominating the front page).

Glad to see someone mentioning Van Flandern.  Also important to mention that he hypothesized that planets & moons are "born" out of a fission process:https://youtu.be/eu0K_7q_xEI?t=3851This is the only theory I'm aware of that really makes sense with Velikovsky's conclusion that Venus was ejected from Jupiter (the red spot).

I find this CIA experiment with ~~Ingo Swann~~ don't remember who it was, but may have been, to be interesting and relevant:The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago.

Isn't it established that a planet *was* supposed to be there but Jupiter's gravity kinda prevented the accretion?Quick wikipedia:>The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals.[7] Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet.[7][8] Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt

It could have been destroyed by a gamma ray burst or perhaps an extremely temporary occurrence of  strange matter collision that caused the annihilation of Planet V. 

Literally the plot of "Inherit the Stars", ca 1977.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giants_series

hmm.. couldnt find the equiptment failing part, but in the wiki said:The density of Phobos has now been directly measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3.[57] Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile.[57] In addition, images obtained by the Viking probes in the 1970s clearly showed a natural object, not an artificial one.  :(

The cardiac cadence/circadian rhythm and biological clock conform almost precisely to the Martian day.

The Earth spun faster in the past. 

It seems as though newer studies put it back closer to 24 hours:http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/07/human-biological-clock-set-back-an-hour/

unfortunately for that theory, the old days were shorter.  length of the day is increasing over time. hence the leap seconds.  my internal clock goes on 36hs, but neither my wife nor my boss want me to sleep 12hs longer each day ;-)

Or maybe humans are originally from another planet that has 25 hour day and has much better ecosystem for humans. Who knows maybe Atlantis or Garden of Eden are not places or cities on Earth in the past but actual Planets in our Galaxy or beyond...

> and some astronomical event slowed it downWhich would happen when the earth has grown since. 

if there is a civ that able to make nuclear, of course they would able to make bunker as well, and to debunk those prehistoric nuclear warfare on mars, someone simply need to find those bunker in the future or mars exploration

My guess is that this wave anomaly is from a cloak that hides whats on the moon.  Or maybe what we think is a rock in space is something else entirely, and only made to look like a rock in space.

Better video that shows 10 wave captures and discusses them from someone who shot the first one.  Also tells how he was attacked by official sources.  He has many videos talking about this and what it may mean.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM

Really?  I read an in depth explanation on how this "wave" anomaly *was* caused by the camera.  I'll have to dig for the post.edit:  found the possible explanation.https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/26sby2/hologram_visual_wave_covering_the_moon/chuav6y/Unless that's been debunked I thinks it's a very reasonable explanation.

I think it's a similar effect like asphalt on a hot day. The ground looks wavy and moving.The atmosphere has an amount of heat I'd assume(even at night) but since it's at such a large scale the waves aren't as extreme

My vote is refraction from shifting air density in Earth's atmosphere.

what in the actual fuck !  its like someone turned V-sync off on the moon lol, on a serious note though, any scientific explanation / debunking to this ?

Hologram theory is interesting, but people need to remember it's not the government, it is some other intelligence or "creator" who is showing us that hologram, this is part of the theory that we are essentially in a prison planet, zoo, or some type of ant farm/sim city project. The other about moon waves is more simple, and biblical, which is that space is water, and we are lied to about it. As above, so below. God separated the waters from the waters. I've always liked the water theory because it explains a lot. Look at space, planets, stars in a telescope and you see it all looks like it's  lights under water. Astronauts train in water, their suits are built to exist in water. The deepest sea dive ever recorded that they found water within water, a shore with waves underneath the ocean and they simply bounced off when trying to submerge in the secondary pool. 

Can't watch the video, but had this shower thought: could it be a Schlieren effect from a plane passing by?

[Here is a youtube channel that is all about that](https://www.youtube.com/user/Crrow777/videos)

 

What the fuck 

Some think these make the moon look holographic, but I think the moon is hollow, and that vibration is like when you ring a bell and the surface vibrates. NASA states that when they landed on the moon it [rang like a bell!](https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/15mar_moonquakes.html)

The moon is an astral body. And we are dreaming. Our Physical reality is built with a template that reflects our state of what we call dreaming. So in a sense everything is from that template and it's product though it seems solid, is actually the dream manifest.Especially light bodies in space. These bodies receive influx of energy to maintain their form. Just like we do. Only we don't analyze how our own energy field ripples. It does, just like the moon's energy field. It's template reality.

Is there footage of said anomaly taken from space?

Why could this video not be faked, just like NASA faking theirs?

My god that is terrifying.  I got actual chills watching that, and the feeling that I...shouldn't have been seeing it.  Like something out of Lovecraft.  Never even heard of this before either, thanks man

many people are now seeing the moon glitch and change shape as well as refresh like a computer projection

**WTF Clouds behind our Sun and Moon ?**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgnVRdQ7wg0

Could those waves be something closer, a part of our atmosphere?They are cool, though.

Not, being a dick, but can you provide link for debunks, curious.

Where else have you seen a "hologram refresh" , what makes you believe that?Why do you believe that "camera artifacts" can be debunked, but not that it being a hologram be debunked, because that has been debunked a thousand times over

> And no, it's not the camera or an artifact, that's been debunked multiple times.I'm gonna go with the explanation that it's definitely either the camera or an artifact. That or maybe it's hot air in front of the camera.

Those are fraudulent.  Observe the moon with your own equipment and you will never see one.

This is a great comment, it should have responses.The UNLESS is very intriguing here.

I can't help but wonder if it's a property marker, much like these....https://duckduckgo.com/?q=obelisk&t=ffsb&iax=1&ia=images

the far side of the moon would, in fact, be the face of the sun. I believe they would align perfectly.

cool, might as get this over with

 

The moon doesn't orbit in a perfect circle around the earth.  Sometimes it's closer, some times it's further away. In fact, the difference between the closest and farthest points is about 30,000 miles.This does have an appreciable effect on how big the moon appears, and can even make it appear noticeably smaller than the sun.  An [annular eclipse](https://www.google.com/search?q=annular+eclipse&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPlJWIs7zVAhUG0mMKHdG6D8YQ_AUICigB&biw=1600&bih=794) is when the moon eclipses the sun, but is close to the far point in its orbit.  This makes the moon smaller than the sun in the sky, allowing a ring of sunlight to pass around the moon (this ring is called an annulus).

No, it would have to be much much more than 100 miles. 100 miles is nothing.Also the moon doesn't stay the same distance all around the earth, just as the earth isn't always the same distance from the sun. During a perfect solar eclipse, the moon doesn't quite cover the whole sun as we still see a kind of halo around the moon. If they were the exact same size in the sky we wouldn't get that.

now I know a lot of Christians don't believe in aliens due to not being explicitly written in the Bible, but my theory is that if God designed the Earth to be so full of all sorts of diverse lifeforms, why would he leave the rest of the Universe barren of other life? Surely he would populate them with all sorts of unique life as to reflect His glory. After all, human curiosity has taken us to journey out of the Earth. What good would this curiosity do if there was nothing to find out there?

ironically, nowadays that in itself is a crazy conspiracy theory to a lot of people :P, but one i agree with, although i do hope other planets with life exist and that god didn't decide to stop with us for some reason. 

i believe A god made it. or rather a very intelligent being and we are the product of a large science experiment and we aren't the only ones. and other planets in our solar system have undergone the same testing. mostly mars 

The moon is actually drifting away, what's "convenient" is that we get to see it at a time when it appears to be approximately the same size as the sun.

The chance of that occurring by accident is much more incredible than most people realize.

They're not that perfect. Only for those right in the path of the shadow.http://www.eclipse2017.org/2017/maps/whole-us.jpg

It is also ludicrously unlikely!

Well no one complains about the odds of evolution which is just as unlikely.  

Great post. 

perhaps they did fake the Moon landing in order to prove to the public that the Moon is uninhabited when in fact it is settled by other civilizations. William Tompkins stated in his book that when Apollo 11 landed in Tranquility, there were huge alien warships circled around the edge of the crater. later they used other films to show to the public broadcast instead. then with the alien's permission the apollo program sent several other missions before being barred from coming back again

Religious reasons, they think the earth being round is the number one thing in history that leads people away from god, and a flat earth would absolutely have to be designed

 

The purpose is to hide God. Read your bible,the sun wasn't made until the 4th day and it was made to give light to the earth. There is nothing in the bible that supports a spinning ball earth rotating around the sun. Please dont point to Isaiah 40:22 and tell me that proves a ball earth,it literally says circle. A circle isn't a ball. Satan rules the world right now (Luke 4:5-7) and we are in the age of deception. Pray for discernment and read your bible.

I heard the ridge was a result of a ring like Saturns collapsing after formation. 

Iapetus is the Roman name for Japheth.Japheth was the eldest son of Noah, and his sons were the first to be taught by God how to bury their dead, and the supposed progenitor of the Caucasians.Japheth was a Roman way of saying someone has Greek blood (i.e. a bloodline from time immemorial).

[Bright Insight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=335vSSTjWdI).  People claim to have seen lights coming from the moon.  Moon Express is launching a mining operation to the south pole of the moon.  Moon rocks from the moon contain unnatural (artificial) isotopes.  It goes on and on!

David Icke talks about this in his books and even mentions some of the work shown here. Starts around the 51:00 mark https://youtube.com/watch?v=VJorKZEbQsA

I was interested, but I couldn't handle the presenter.  I'm a little disappointed.

Interesting hypothesis.

Never heard this one.

Holy shit.  That was fucking amazing.  I was expecting some sort of stupid Hollow Earth calibre idea here, but that... kinda makes sense...

It's cool seeing hypothesis that go against the mainstream. It's less cool seeing hypothesis that argument against an imaginary theory, because the author do not understand the mainstream theory.He claims "mathematicians" claim that heavier elements formed in DISTANT random supernovaes. The actual idea is that they formed on the supernova that originated our system, using the atoms of a single supernova to build the current sun and planets.Just like arguments of the fake moon landing. It could be fake, but arguments like "you should see the stars!" are not helping the case at all.

The moon has incredibly irregular gravity, which makes having this orbit it quite difficult. So the grand plans of towing asteroids into orbit of the moon are much harder than people think. The gravity is irregular because of discrepancies in the density of different parts of the moon. There is quite a wealth of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed. 

I love that you swing both ways ;-)So, if you mentioned Pink Floyd, is it a coincidence they were friends with Douglas Adams, creator of HHGTG?Now, that was a book that made my thought juices flow!

Why not though? The universe is ginormous and strange and rare things happen all the time. The moon was once closer to the earth and its getting farther away each year, meaning one day it won't appear the same size as the sun in the sky. We are just fortunate enough to be alive at this time to witness this.

Shower thought.. Moon is artificial Moon doesn't perfectly eclipse When did it? Answer this and we know how old the moon is. Why was a perfect eclipse necessary? Someone needed a window against the Sun's direct energy? Then again, night would solve that... Literally just crazy thoughts about something I've never really thought about 

Why wouldn't you see blue sky? You don't see it through the moon so much as you see the bright part of the moon reflecting sunlight through the blue sky.Having said that, it is interesting that the moon and sun appear almost the same size in the sky. 

> I was always curious as to why we could see the blue sky through the MoonYou don't see the blue sky through the Moon, you see the Moon through the blue sky.Imagine a crescent moon at night.  The dark side of it appears black, much like the space surrounding it.  Now imagine the same crescent moon during the day, the "dark" side appears blue, much like the space surrounding it.Also, if it were semi-transparent, then how do you explain Earthshine?

you can see the dark side of the moon during the day (or at night) with a telescope. its not transparent. the sky is blue and you see the bright moon through the sky not the blue sky through the moon.

> It is too a coincidence we never see the 'dark side of the Moon'It's the inevitable result of Earths gravitation influence. If you nudged the moon and made it spin a bit faster, it would eventually go back to how it is now. 

> The moon also has an atmosphere. Google it.Too thin an atmosphere to support liquid water or greenery as we know it.   >The moon is an artificial satellite. There is overwhelming evidence for this. There is not.

jesus... I wish there was enough funding to send all of the moon deniers or people who think it is a hologram or has an atmosphere, up to the moon so they can check it out themselves.Commercial spaceflight cant come soon enough...

Go on

All the planets in our solar system. I'm sure in the billions of galaxies there are more that have this rare feature. Maybe not.

> Can someone smart tell me how rare it actually is that our moon fits in the sun?Not that rare.  100% of the Earth's moons behave in this manner.

not just that it fits in there but that it fits in there while humans are on earth. a few million years ago and it was too close for a perfect fit in a few million years from now it will be too far away for a perfect fit. factthat it is a perfect fit in the time when humans can use this to better observe the sun and space and it is all so damn perfect it is Ludacris. 

Okay, I read the link.. I get the basics in reference to the crates and whatnot, but what, exactly does this whole theory express? I don't want to buy the book.

That's cool I didn't know the thing about the moon meteorites.  Thanks

That's a very interesting thought

lol what? just what? the moon doesn't cool objects in its light. what? the sun and the moon are not the same thing. you can see them both in the same sky at the same time. what kind of primitive thinking are you using here?

Lunatics...  Interested in the moon!

You do relatise that Pluto has a moon, Charon, that's quite similar in size to Pluto itself? I know it's been desclasified as a planet, but it's a celestial object with another just as large as itself in orbit around each other.

Suggest it for the next one! Better yet, compile some info and make your own post! I think a more general "anomalous ancient sites" topic would be a great future round table. For example, [here's some stuff I found out about Puma Punku](https://www.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/1q912q/puma_punku_is_an_ancient_archaeological_site_in/), an amazing site in Bolivia.tbh, the civilizations associated with these sites and the origin of the moon might be more related that you might think (we're supposed to be going high octane, right?).After all, Aristotle wrote of an ancient people called the "Proselenes" who lived in Arcadia and who were said, by the very nature of their name, to have lived "before there was a moon in the sky".Some writers (ie the authors of Who Built the Moon?) think future humanity literally went back in time to put the moon there. 

I see 38 votes for moon anomalies, 5 for phobos anomalies, and 10 for hollow earth which easily puts this topic at #1.

 

Lemme elaborate on this since ive read about in on the internet, when you die your spirit, not your soul, releases its grip on the body, causing a release of heat, this heat will carry your spirit to the moon where the moon will absorb and digest it, your spirit will cease to exist, BUT, if you managed to develop a soul from the seed that is your spirit in your lifetime you will be able to choose wether to stay in our solar system within the ifluence of the sun as a soul, to feed the moon consciously, or to travel straight into the sun and become one with our creator, that is what ive read, yes what a crock of shit

Not exactly.

thats the craziest thing I've ever heard that gets thrown around a lot. Don't believe that nonsense, it's to instill fear.

The moon is less dense than earth, which actually supports the hollow moon theory. If the moon was formed by material ejected from the earth in a collision, then that material would have come from the crust of the earth, not the earth's denser core.  The collision formation theories are most accepted, but vary from what objects collided with the earth to form the moon.  Seismometers placed on the moon in the 1970's, though, recorded the moon "ringing like a bell."  By this time we'd landed on the darn thing and still weren't convinced the moon was solid.  Of course, the argument can be made that a society sophisticated enough to craft a moon sized space station could sufficiently camouflage it to fool the primitives who live on the host planet.

I have heard the moon being translucent and stars being seen through the unlit half of the moon but never witnessed this or ever seen pictures/video of it. I imagine with all the eyes in the world looking up at the moon that we would have some pictures out there of stars in the dark side of the moon but they just don't exist. I have a telescope and can see the unlit half of the moon during the day. its always there and it has never appeared to be see through any time I have ever looked at it. 

>Whoever built the pyramids had a clear understanding of the size of the earth and the moon.That's not proof they understood the size of the Earth and Moon, just that they were able to produce a pyramid with a set of dimensions that squared the circle. The Earth and Moon do the same "coincidentally", but someone on Earth could figure out those proportions and admire their mathematical elegance *on their own* without ever looking up at the sky.

>Considering the moon is the ONLY moon that is perfectly round, faces its planet with the same side always,Both of those statements are wrong. There are plenty of perfectly spherical moons in the solar systems, name just about any moon of a jovian planet and its likely to be spherical. Also, Pluto and Charon are tidally locked (which is the term for when a moon orbits at the same speed of its rotation so one side is constantly facing the planet) to one another. I think there are a few other cases of tidal locking in the solar system as well. 

Yeah...a satellite. Arabs before being Muslims were venerating the Moon...see 3/4 of muslim countries flags and coat of arms featuring quarter moons.So you're saying there was a a satellite of the moon in the 7th century?

Aliens, aliens gave humans that knowledge. Also possibly fallen angels enamored with human women. 

I realized that right after I made the post, thank you, it's 22/7.

Funny how some people put effort into finding patterns between numbers everywhere, yet don't put any effort into remembering (or even checking) for arguably the most know value of all, Pi. Says a lot about what their true aim is.Maybe if one would invest more time into understanding and less time into explaining, the world would be a better place.

You said it brother

It was Joe McMoneagle. Ingo Swann did write an amazing book (That you can find for free online as a pdf) called 'Penetration' In which he remote viewed the dark side of the moon. And what he found was amazing. He also talks about the strange but proven facts of the moon such as how it has an atmosphere, Wind, Greenery, Water, ect.If you guys are interested in this stuff please check out my sub r/projectstargate I also have a video interview posted of McMoneagle talking about that "Trip" to mars.

The Mars/Jupiter papers are both great.  Page 6 of the Jupiter paper discusses solar & planetary fission... something I hadn't heard of outside of Van Flandern.  Thanks! 

Dun dun dun

Is that the prevailing theory in cosmology? Is it just the assumed natural evolution of the solar system?  i.e. What would happen if nothing dramatic occured astronomically to affect the earth's motion? Or, is there evidence of this rate of rotation decreasing?  Anyhow, it doesn't explain the biological clock.  

interesting thanks!

Length is gradually increasing over time, okay, but that ignores my suggestion that an astronomical event dramatically decreased it at some time in the past.

That's a lot of growth.  If that's your theory, where'd it come from?

that's flawed, the nuclear war he talks about apparently gouged out massive canyon's and is singlehandedly responsible for factmars is a desert wasteland now, hell it used to have oceans, to assume anyone beyond the very rare bunker or statue or temple, and i mean VERY rare, is absolutely absurd. Although i like the way you think. 

now this i can get behind. perhaps its a cloaking device that keeps amateur astronomers from seeing the cities and bases built there

>  maybe what we think is a rock in space is something else entirelyLike an alien observation station and its off limits for humans.

This is actually one of the better theories out there. Thank you for a very fresh alternative perspective.I do remember a certain researcher (God I forgot the name, I think he had some really long lectures on the Moon and Mars on Youtube) discuss how probes sent to the Moon hit a giant wall before coming to a halt. As if there were structures on the Moon. Built by aliens? Built by ancient humans? Current humans? Who knows, it is an interesting theory though.

interesting, it could also be waves caused by a change in temperature in the layer between moon and layers of atmosphere or there is a layer of water between us and the moon layer.

Great channel actually was watching some stuff on there before I found this thread. 

 

If the equipment causes it, why does the 'wave' go out of frame in one video where he pans, then it reappears in the frame from the bottom edge without having changed speed or angle, exactly where it would have been if he hadn't panned? EDIT: [video here](https://youtu.be/XL5zuq5mtwc)I don't see how this clip is compatible with that redditor's explanation. The wave phenomenon seems to be totally decoupled from any equipment effects.

That's not an explination.  I've never heard about this stuff until today, but if you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM&app=desktop) about a third of the way through it he shows how the camera will pan and the wave will not pan with it, which clearly shows it's something external to the device. The only explination that makes any sense in light of that information is that it's atmospheric. 

Sure it is a good explanation but that doesn't mean that single comment discredits the entire thing, and what helps back my thought up is the comment below it blindly accepts it so quickly.  https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/26sby2/hologram_visual_wave_covering_the_moon/chuegx9/

sorry but that's not the same effect. your example shows the entire image effected. like when you take a pic when your phone vibrates. the moon wave is completely different bc the entire photo doesnt vibrate. there is clearly a wave anomaly that is happening on the moon. the wave on moves across the surface. it pulses and is not constant as your effect describes. space above it not effected. its a sweeping wave that moves consistently across the surface and wraps the curvature of the moon. 

Too bad the heat waves coming up from the ground are in a randomized chaotic pattern, not a formulated straight forward line like on the moon. Riddle me that.

except its not a hot day on the moon.. ever..

Looks to me like it's only on the moon though..if it was an atmospheric phenomenon, you'd see that wave in the space around the moon too

You didn't look at the evidence.

ive looked and i cant find any scientific article even mentioning it.

>  and they simply bounced offThey bounced off because it wasn't water, it was brine and of a higher density and buoyancy than water.

It's the atmosphere, dude. Gas is fluidic, just observe the behavior of air above pavement on a hot day. That's why it all looks like lights under water *from an Earth-situated telescope* but not from any videos from in space (assuming you believe any of them are real).

> essentially in a prison planet, zoo, or some type of ant farm/sim city project.You are referring to Gnosticism. Where God is real, and the universe was created, but not by God but a kind of "malevolent force" with the hopes of separating consciousness and hiding from consciousness it's beginning/true power. This is the ancient religion that the Matrix movies are based around. > I've always liked the water theory because it explains a lotLiterally impossible as red/blue shifting wouldn't be a thing and at a certain distance away from us stars would just not be visible (like just about any source of light not in our solar system).

well space isn't a true vacuum anyways, it has material that floats around. though if applying the holofractal theory, space is considered a type of matter

 

I want to find that video of the water in watet. I remember seeing years ago. The water had a current and waves. It was so wierd. I don't recall the part where they bounced off it though. It was some time ago.

I think if this was proven to not be atmosphere (as it's definitely not equipment related) then it would serve as proof that we're living in a simulated reality.

Don't you dare fucking bring god into this, that ruins any shred of credibility.

Or an illusion caused by temperature change, shifting air masses, water vapor or any host of atmospheric event- especially if the waves move from the bottom upward? 

Thanks!

Yes. This is the same reason stars twinkle.

search youtube for moon wave, there are plenty of other examples.  It's really weird, looks like a video that's refreshing

 

I think you're taking that a good ways out of context. Since they're talking about seismic activity it reads as if he's referring to long, continued vibrations and shaking. Something like a handbell or even the vibrations felt after striking a bell. That doesn't necessarily mean it's hollow, just that he was describing the very long time frames of the tremors. 

Ok so if we're dreaming, what and where are our real bodies that are currently sleeping? 

> glitchAny video of this?

I can't stand this as a flat earth argument. 

Argument for a locality. These kind of pics cast doubt on their actual distance... This is part of how I startd to wonder if things are different than our education teaches us.

That's not right

 

Are we, like...the chosen ones?

Thought to be fair, just because something has low odds of occurring doesn't mean it can't occur. 

*Never tell me the odds!**That's no moon!*Star Wars overload!

The moon used to be closer to the Earth though. It's moving away from us at consistent pace. 

This.

This kind of stuff more or less cherrypicks in various ways, between which celestial bodies are being compared, the grounds for comparison, and the relationships being found.  For every one "Woah" relationship found, a hundred duds were thrown out.If you examine everything for all conceivable relationships, the biggest coincidence would be finding no coincidences.

Evolution doesn't happen by chance. Evolution is the result of natural selection. For your comparison to be true, there would had to have been many different shaped and sized moons orbiting Earth, yet now only one remains due to its specific shape and size.

All this comment means is that you don't, or don't want to, understand evolution. 

I think it's pretty likely. The variety of breeds humans have been able to produce just by selective breeding kind of shows how we can make animals change to have certain traits. Now just do that but for millions of years and eventually the DNA will be so far apart that breeds won't be able to produce viable offspring anymore. 

So because the Bible says the Earth is round even when everyone else thought it was flat.  So the Catholic church figured if people realized it was flat they wouldn't believe in God so it started a conspiracy to this day to get more church members?  Clearly all of this is created either way.  Either we are creating this reality, or another entity is.  I mean the flat earth has to be at the most likely to not exist out of 100's.  I doubt 10% on /conspiracy believe it's flat.  There's just so much evidence from pictures of the Earth from space.  I don't think any of it has to do with religion.  The Roman Catholics did get very corrupt just after a few hundred years though so I wouldn't put it past them to lie to scare people into giving money.

 

I have the same attitude towards the flat earth theory as you do. If it were flat, I don't think it just be so NASA can rack in cash. I believe it would be hundreds of years before NASA was even born, that the deception would have started. But then we have People like Newton who would also have to be a lie.Too me, as a guy who's only watched like 20 mins about it, maybe the earth is simply bigger then what they tell us?  Apparently NASA means to deceive in Hebrew. Huge if true.

I read the Bible 3 times a year cover to cover brother.  I've only seen support for a round earth over and over and over in the Bible.

There's nothing in the bible that supports airplanes either, but I rode in one just the other day.

Even [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_ridge_on_Iapetus) for the equatorial ridge is pretty explicit:>It is not clear how the ridge formed. One difficulty is to explain why it follows the equator almost perfectly. There are at least four current hypotheses, but none of them explains why the ridge is confined to Cassini Regio.It's easily one of the most incredible unexplained things we've discovered in our solar system.The ring "Chicken Little" theory [was suggested by](https://gizadeathstar.com/2014/04/can-relax-now-mysterious-equatorial-ridge-iapetus-finally-explained/) *Discover* Magazine:>The *Discover* article points out that the theory has not yet been "peer reviewed", but there it is. We're being asked to believe on the basis of a computer-claptrap model that the ridge "fell from the sky" after "rings" were formed around the planet, rings which were unstable, and which fell into the surface of the planet.>Uh huh. What about those three parallel grooves? Were there three neatly parallel ring unstable ring systems?There's actually *another* theory that "Iapetus may have possessed its own moon that became tidally shredded to create a ring system that eventually fell to the moon's surface.">OK...a moon with a moon which became tidally shredded to form a neat ring, which was unstable, which then fell to Iapetus' surface and formed that neat equatorial ridge. And, presumably, became shredded in such a way to form three closely bunched parallel rings in three planes which were all unstable and then fell to the planetary surface?>Would Iapetus have had sufficient force to be able to shred its own moon? Can we see what the possible mass of that moon may have been? Would it have been enough to create the equatorial ridge?"But whatever the source, it seems scientists are agreeing that Iapetus couldn't have created the mountain range without some help from up above.">I don't know about you, but that strikes me as yet another tongue in cheek remark. "Help from above?" Help implies helpers. Helpers implies intelligence. Intelligence implies...>...on yea, we can't go there. The ridge has been "explained." Perfectly natural. >Nothing to see here...move along, it fell from the sky after a moon was tidally shredded to form an unstable ring system which collapsed and fell on poor Iapetus....

You are right, he definitely has a chip on his shoulder. He is brilliant, however. He is responsible for smuggling Pentium computer chip tech to the Soviets early nineties...

I think this one is from the Stellar Metamorphosis theory. Basically, the universe is a lot older than 13.8 billion years... possibly eternal. And all planets are formed from the eroded leftovers of stars.According this this theory, the sun would be the youngest object in our solar system. Jupiter would be a fair bit older. Earth would be a lot older and Mercury is absolutely ancient.

That other physicist that people post here theorized that everything is a black hole and all we see are the event horizons 

Thanks for commenting!

Orbiting the moon is certainly impractical. For parking asteroids for mining purposes, the earth-moon lagrange points L4 and L5 would make a lot more sense, though I'm not sure how viable"landing" something the size of substantial asteroid into those points would be; on-site extraction might just be more practical than moving the entire asteroids.

 

Why don't planets stop spinning then, as they are like moons to the sun?Do other planets moons not rotate?Edit: Found this cool article: http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/44-our-solar-system/the-moon/general-questions/110-does-the-moon-rotate-are-there-other-moons-that-always-keep-one-face-toward-their-planet-intermediate, which provides info towards my second question.  Interesting stuff

>Too thin an atmosphere to support liquid water or greenery as we know it.What is you PhD in? Where do you base this on? When accredited scientists have proven otherwise.> There is not.Edited:Prove to me that the moon is a natural satellite. I can, and will debunk this. History books on the moon are, and have been re written. New evidence trumps old theories.

What about the 3 Apallo spacecraft that were fuelled, and ready to bring men back to the moon, that were left to rust. We have the money to go back. We already spent some. But TPTB refuse to. Why is that? You said "If only there was funding." Like our fiat monetary system couldnt establish that. We dont go back to the moon for a very exact reason.

Our grandchildren will laugh at our presumptions the same way we laugh at our grandfathers.

I can elaborate on this. The moon's distance and size relative to the earth is almost too coincidental to be naturally occurring. There is a fair amount of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed. There are records in some extremely ancient cultures of certain peoples being around 'before the moon'. There is no theory for the formation of the moon that makes sense, the impact theory is something championed by most people but they don't read the next paragraph of that theory which states that an almost equal impact would have been necessary directly after to correct course and spin. The is a very compelling case that the moon isn't naturally occurring. If you're interested read a book called 'Who built the moon' by Christopher Knight. Very interesting, although their conclusions leave something to be desired. The theory that it was flown here has risen from a combination of these different anomalies. It would make sense to place a large body like the moon around a planet a species was interested in interacting with, sort of like hiding in plain sight. The notion that the moon isnt naturally occurring gives credence to this. Of course it's just a theory, there is no conclusive proof it is a type of space ship. But then again, if there was conclusive proof this topic wouldn't be in the conspiracy subreddit ;).  

hahah like really go on. 

Sweet. I'll be checking in on this one. I hope it's a hallowed out space ship. That's crazy cool.

actually the table is a sphere

[Exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB2Ad04mukI)

Well at least you understood my small effort to inject a little humour. The original meaning of "lunatic" actually meant being under the spell of the Moon or "Luna" which is it's ancient name, like the ancient one for the Sun which is "Sol" from which we get solar, solstice, etc.The French word for the moon still is "la Lune" and there were of course people in ancient times who worshipped the Moon and "Diana" who was the goddess of the Moon and was believed to live on the Moon and they used to dance and frolic under the light of the full Moon in their outdoor ceremonies dedicated to her. And then there's the whole business about moonlight being romantic and people falling in love in the moonlight.And the Moon is very strange and mysterious and we really don't know very much about it and a whole lot of people really are utterly fascinated by the whole business... almost to the point of being under a spell by it.But there can't be any of those "lunatics", here, now can there? Or maybe I should have said "moon-atics"? 

The astronomers no longer consider Pluto to be a planet for a number of valid reasons and it's difficult to say what either Pluto and Charon actually are at this point. If I'm not mistaken Charon is the much larger of the two and they both actually orbit around a point in space *between them* that actually traces their path around the Sun. It's unusual because that point between them is closer to Pluto giving Charon an outer orbit around that point and Pluto taking an inner orbit around it on the opposite side of it as if they were rigidly connected through that point in their motions. So it isn't any typical planet/moon arrangement but two bodies orbiting an invisible point as if they were both moons going around it. Their tumbling orbit around the Sun as they wheel around it together is also highly unusual and brings them even closer to the Sun than Neptune is throughout parts of it probably because they weren't created by or with our system but rather captured and pulled into that off-kilter orbit after being cast-off from another system beyond ours.

was it the Alex jones and David Ich one?

That's no moon...

> The moon is less dense than earth, which actually supports the hollow moon theory.How?

Yeah. I've heard the distance increases the rate of recession, so it's 4cm/year now, but a million years from now it could be 1km/year (just making up numbers to explain)But yes right now the sun and moon share the same apparent diameter. In the distant future that won't be the case anymore, making total solar eclipses impossible.

What do you mean by>strange but proven facts of the moon such as how it has an atmosphere, Wind, Greenery, Water,

>  Or, is there evidence of this rate of rotation decreasing?Yes, [we've measured it decreasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) 

Not really _my_ theory, just a thought I love to entertain, simply for the beauty of it (the continent coasts don't only fit where the Atlantic is, but also where the pacific is). "[Expanding Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanding_Earth)" gives nice search results on YouTube, and it seems to overlap here and there with "Electric Universe"/"Plasma Universe" approaches to cosmology. Interesting trivia: it _precedes_ Wegeners plate tectonics theory by almost a century :)

I've found the moon rabbit hole is deep and one of the most disturbing, because dealing with the implications of all the strangeness, coincidences, and anomalies having to do with the moon is so far-reaching it can shake the foundations of everything you think you know.Crrow777, the man who captured the first video of the lunar wave, has a good Youtube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Crrow777) if you want to dive in.  You can search for "moon" in his videos, but he delves into a lot more.  This guy will have you questioning everything.

You are thinking of Phobos, a moon of Mars.The Soviets sent 22 probes, none sent back useful info - one is even rumoured to have filmed a rocket leave the surface and impact the Soviet's probe.

There's a great video of (amateur?) rocket equipped with outer camera going from surface of the earth to zero gravity. It's almost as if it hits the water. Google it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/26sby2/hologram_visual_wave_covering_the_moon/chuhvh7/that's also explained. > He rotated the camera with respect to the 'field' and corrected the image with editing software or a field rotation prism in the telescope>You are probably right on and in one of his videos he says he done exactly as you say, rotating the camera then turning the image back right with editing software.

Because it is fraud by Crow77. Make your own observations and you will never see one.

Or Fraud.  That would explain it.  It would also explain why no one else has observed.

He's saying that since the camera is on earth (and in Florida in this particular video), the heat in earth's atmosphere may cause a visible ripple. 

no the moon but OUR atmosphere here on Earth. we are looking through it to the moon which distorts its image slightly. thats my take on it. Not that the moon is hot

That's assuming the wave covers the entire length of the cameras POV, which translates to thousands of miles. Stars twinkle all the time precisely because of these atmospheric waves, but they don't twinkle in unison because these shifting densities are smaller in scale than that.

No, we wouldnt expect to see it on the dark area around the moon -- there is no light from there reaching our eyes. 

I watched the video.  What evidence do you mean?

I don't believe anything anymore 

Too bad the heat waves coming up from the ground are in a randomized chaotic pattern, not a formulated straight forward line like on the moon. Riddle me that.

What's the holofractal theory? I try visit that sub but can't understand anything posted there 

Near vacuum.

Search for 'Underwater brine pools'.

It's so hard to find the real video with the researchers talking about it, it was intentionally deleted I believe by the BBC and they were able to have youtube delete basically all the uploads. That's one of those things where you have to wonder what is so damaging about that account from a scientist that they went to that much effort to erase it entirely. Much like antarctica, there is much hidden about the deep ocean for unknown reasons, very little is allowed to be released to the public. 

[Is this it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZD2STt_OU)

perhaps, but what intrigues me is why the wave seems to follow the curvature of the moon rather than just traveling over 

It is fraud, plain and simple.

you win the award for the worlds most ignorant response 

It doesn't do that through a telescope.  I've tried many times.  I don't know if it's the atmosphere or the video camera but it isn't the moon.  I know that for sure.  It's real and round 100%.  I know this is /conspiracy but I have a lot of friends with big telescopes.  

 

Sweet!  I do that too!  I just need a better camera to mount on my lens.  Right now it's decent but maybe half the quality as these vids.  It's really cool to have a telescope with GPS hooked up to a camera recording on your laptop. 

way to take what they said out of context. seismic activity needs shifting plates. considering NASA previous statements about the moon, I think "rang like a bell" has a literal connotation. 

Hmm, let me try to be as clear as possible. The body you are in now is actually a physical projection from a different state, ..though it's not so much a state as it is a different area of our consciousness.  The only difference between your waking and dreaming self is that while waking we separate from that area of dreaming. And in doing so project a dream reality apart from it. The key to understanding our planets and moons and space in general is that it is a reflection of our focus. As we are projecting into this dream we agree on a focus. A template. A model. And this 'entering into' as a focus here, during that entering the focus adopts the model and projects it as a reality. So when most think of planets having an effect on us, or that they were the results of God's or scientific Theories... that is the complete opposite of what is actually happening. The human consciousness is reflecting itself as a layered reality.  Dense physical waking self in one area, and then light astral body dreaming self, or space, as another layer of consciousness.

Many. Go up in the thread I'm on mobile 

 

Well, we and the people a couple thousand years before and after us...?

Only as far as solar eclipses are concerned. 

Yes, this is pretty similar to theists saying that the low odds of our planet being in the goldilocks zone is proof of a designer. 

A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

Perhaps even evolution isn't happening by chance. It could be that all of reality, including all of nature is communicating with itself on a quantum level in closed systems - thus creating grounds for an intelligent evolution, with intelligent mutations, not entirely random ones. One where "Intelligent design" isn't done by a Deity, but by nature itself.This is supported by the /r/holofractal theory of the Universe (not yet validated by mainstream science and probably missing some parts and connections to make it so, but I do feel it is a step in the right direction).

I do understand evolution.  Be honest, the odds of life evolving on this planet or anywhere else in the universe are just as improbable as the uniqueness of our planet's moon.  Improbable but not impossible.  You should learn to appreciate that.  

>So because the Bible says the Earth is round even when everyone else thought it was flat. So the Catholic church figured if people realized it was flat they wouldn't believe in God so it started a conspiracy to this day to get more church members? Clearly all of this is created either way. Either we are creating this reality, or another entity is.That isn't my understanding. My impression from speaking with flat-earthers is that the bible says the earth is circular, but not "round" in the way you mean it. They all believe that the bible strongly implies that the earth is flat and round (circular). They believe that the push towards thinking the earth is a globe and could have formed naturally is specifically to make people believe that a god isn't required for the earth to exist, while a flat earth could not form naturally and is proof of gods design.Not that there aren't flat-earthers who aren't religious, but that's really been the only motive I've heard for this supposedly huge cover-up

Im a skeptic but I had fun going down this rabbit hole for a bit. I like to read about oddities in space but I dont seek them out much. The wall is certainly interesting 

Corporate espionage?

If that's true then what is Cosmic Background Radiation? 

So I've thought about this some and I have an admittedly probably stupid idea.  Mainstream physics: the edge of the universe is similar to an event horizon, and the schwarzschild radius of something with the mass of the estimated mass of the universe would be about the radius of the observable universemy madness: we are inside a black hole, collapsing.  The reason we see an expanding universe is simply that we perceive time as the direction where entropy increases.  It's arbitrary whether we are collapsing or expanding.

It's possible.

Absolutely.  I'm 35 and I'm already becoming a grumpy old man :D

I love moon mythology. I remember reading this YouTube transcription of Stichens Sumerian tablets, and how the Anunnaki were always enamoured by our moon. Perhaps they were amazed because they knew it was fake but they themselves didn't build it? Whoa dude.  Aliens upon aliens! That said, let's be scientific. If the moon IS FAKE, how can we test and prove it? Is it falsifiable? If we trace time back, can we figure out when the move actually arrived? I posted a thought earlier to wondering when our lunar eclipse used to PERFECTLY eclipse the sun? Is there something interesting about that date? If it was designed to perfectly eclipse, why? What technological advantage would that present? Perhaps it needs constant reorbiting to keep it in the perfect eclipse range but after its creators/operators left, it has been spiralling outwards ever since?  HOLY fucking shit... https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-solar-eclipse-coincidence/The last paragraph seems to indicate that TREX would have seen a full eclipse..... 50 million years from now we won't have total eclipses anymore.. Therefore it happened around 50 or 60 say million years ago.. Did the moon kill the dinosaurs? Yeah, lock me up I've officially gone insane lol

Spoiler Alert: It is ;)

> If I'm not mistaken Charon is the much larger of the twoYou are mistaken. >they both actually orbit around a point in space between themThat's because Charon is such a large moon, that it's fucking with Plutos position. 

> The reason it 'rings like a bell' is because it's composed of more solid, rigid materials, unlike the Earth, which is composed of materials that have far more moistureYou seem pretty certain of that, would you mind explaining where you get that from? Because the moon ringing is established fact. The composition would be based on a handful of moon rocks brought back. One seems far more reliable than the other. Don't take this as a personal attack but it sounds like you aren't willing to entertain the idea the moon is hollow despite compelling evidence that it is. Edit: You did post where you got that from, my mistake for not reading further down. However I read your pdf article. When we theorize the moon is hollow I think you misinterpret what we mean by hollow. It still has something it it's core, the mass in between the surface and the core is evidenced to be either hollow or honeycombed. There is still a core if course because there is still a magnetic field. In fact none of the sources you posted provide a reliable theory for the composition of the moon. That's because there isn't one. The conclusion of the article assumes the impact formation theory, which is in no way reliable or certain. In fact you might be interested to know that the only way the impact theory for the formation of the moon can be correct is if there was a second almost identical impact afterwards. Science based on assumptions is just that. Again, don't take this as a personal attack, it's not. But throwing shade around like;> but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollowWhen your conclusions are based on assumed theories you can't be certain of them. The attitude you are taking is kind of the opposite of the scientific process which you seem to champion so strongly.

Dude, I am not a physicist.  I got that from Wikipedia.  After reading some of the material linked, I gather the difference in density between the earth and the moon despite them being made up of the same material as the earth (theoretically, same materials would have the same density) tends to support the theory that the moon is hollow in the center.  But, if the moon was formed from less dense crust or mantle material and not the more dense iron that makes up the core of the earth, that could account for the difference in density.  Rather than a compact planet with a solid core surrounded by spinning molten metal, the moon is a loose collection of dust and debris held together by loose gravitational bonds making it less dense than earth.  Doesn't make it hollow.  Makes it less dense.  I'm not arguing the moon is hollow.  I'm just sharing information about the theory.

> original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feetA) how the hell would you know the original height to such a specific degree andB) I find no source saying it was that height, it just seems to be convenient to your next equation rather than a representation that's accurate.  According to wikipedia it was 480.6 ft. 

Did they use miles and feet at this time?  I like your theory but i wonder if this would still work in the measuring units of their time.

>The dimensions of the Giza pyramid correspond to dimensions of our planet and the moon at a scale of 1 to 432,000. The sun has a radius of 432,000 miles.How does the pyramid correspond to the the Earth and the Moon at the same scale? It doesn't.>original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feetBest idea for the original height is 480.6 feet or 280 Egyptian cubits480.6 * 432,000 = 207619200 = 39321.8181818 miles >3,938.685 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 11 miles, or an error of about 0.2%)39321.8181818 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 35372 miles or an error of about 90%) you'll probably have to add some crap about ratios or factors in there.You might as well use the real numbers.  Also love the how the pyramid is accurate to 4 decimal places but you're happy to use 432,000 instead of 432287.938 which is the Suns actual radius in miles and good to let slide errors in measuring the polar radius.  Could that be because none of your magic maths would work otherwise?

Fun fact / Maybe we're going too far : the A note used to be 432 hertz before we set it up to 440 relatively recently

Yeah man, I was just enjoying some kooky dooky arguements about the Cloud People, and wherever the fuck the moon came from. Now its ruined by some asshole shoving his randomly quoted text down my throat like it's a 'balloon' that Bill Clinton expects on his birthday. I can bring him up because hes a mind controlled puppet of the Illuminati hell bent on keeping their position of slave masters on this prison we call 'Earth'

I have a pretty damn good telescope, and I can tell you for a fact there is not 'greenery' on the moon.

Those are indeed strange facts. Since most think the moon is a dead/natural satellite.But all of those things listed have been proven as fact. Most back in the 70s. But you see them crop through the news now and again as they are "rediscovered"

I love the idea of flipping everything we know around, because all I feel they need is hidden tech, and they can tell all the lies they want. I know it's not healthy to always think the world is against you, but it helps when you remember it's all of us regular (if you don't want me grouped with you that's cool) people against the ambiguous "them".But I take breaks here and there and enjoy time with friends to solidify myself here and not lose grip.Strange times ahead for sure. 

Not gonna lie this is kind of unnerving 

Crow is a fraud that manufactured those "waves."

Phobos is little more than very large rock. It's about the length of Manhattan. Gravity is near enough to nil that anything living on it would be better off just living in zero-g. 

There are many good leads but this is probably not one of them.  Look up how they "de-spin" rockets which normally spin in order to maintain some orientation.  Absolute linear speed changes are not going to be easy detect with no reference frame.

I'm unconvinced.How does field rotation correlate with a phenomenon that appears to track across the visible moon both before and after the field of view pans?If you feel field rotation is enough then perhaps you can break down how it caused the specific observed effect even after the pan, addressing each of these points:1. The telescope captures a "wave" apparently between the moon and the telescope lens propagating at a constant speed and direction.2. The telescope is panned such that the "wave" is out of the visible frame.3. The "wave" catches up with the visible frame, re-entering from the bottom edge where we would expect it to be if the camera had not panned, and then continues at the same constant speed and direction until reaching the top edge of the moon.

I thought a chap in Germany had independently verified his observation?This is a relatively new phenomenon. I'm open-minded about waiting for more evidence. I'm not saying it's real, but to say outright that it's a fraud is a conclusion without evidence too.

Following Occam's razor, it's much more likely to be atmospheric.

> Not that the moon is hotthe temperature on the surface of the moon hit by the sun can reach over 250¬∞F

Believe in things that can produce results. I 'believe' in many aspects of science because they produce direct, observable results. As for the moon being a hologram? Makes no sense, how could we predict tides if the moon didn't have mass. Moon bases and moon settlements/cities? I doubt it just like everything else. Extraordinary claims, extraordinary evidence, etc. but I don't dismiss it, because I have no way to know one way or the other. 

Either this guy is close to the 'source' or a mad man. Either way, massive respect.

consider things as probability/possibility. belief is a tough one. you can have faith in a thing. apply the sceintific method to a thing. things are harsh. learn as much as you can. it always pays off. 

But believing that you don't believe is itself a belief.

Seems like the safest route for now.

This is hardly meant to be a conclusive argument, but the reason the waves appear chaotic above asphalt is the proximity of high heat makes a lot of displacement waves in the air, which collide into the chaos we're used to seeing. At higher altitudes, few waves would be generated and are less likely to collide, so it's possible to see it keep a consistent angle and velocity.Source: B.S. in physics and a lot of recent experience with wave/sound mechanics

Yea, and I can't find decent information on it.  I want to study the virtual reality aspect of reality or at least things like the moon.I don't know anything about Antarctica other than they seem to be pretty secretive over that place.I can't figure out what the reasoning would be by tricking people it's round if it's flat though.  Even if it is flat, what does that really change or matter?  

[Is this it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZD2STt_OU)

Nonsense.  BBC licensing agreements with YouTube doesnt mean shit.  You can still read the papers these scientists wrote.  Why not just send them an email?

Tbh I think its most likely an artifact of digital recording. It would constantly be refreshing the contrast between the white and the black- i.e, the edge.  Does anyone have footage of this shot with a non-digital film camera? Have these things been seen with the human eye or is it just something that happens if you zoom a digital camera at the moon long enough ?

It *doesn't* follow the curvature. It's more pronounced on the vertical side of the moon and by the time it gets to the top horizontal line it's imperceptible , and *doesn't* come back down the other side. That's exactly what I'd expect if a ripple was moving from down to up in the atmosphere between the observer and the moon.

Cameras are the root of all conspiracies.

 

the entire "sky" is fake. there is no "outer space" in this simulation.

well said. 

So who or what are other people? If their real, why doesn't their dream focus affect my dream too? 

 

How is that? Firstly, the odds aren't really that low, and secondly, that would mean that even if it is low, it's still probable without a creator. 

If a higher dimension entity isn't a designer that how is this being created, by our own minds?  Lol I wonder if Mario and Luigi are atheists. 

Eh that's different though since life should only likely observe itself to be in a place that is suitable for life to be. So like, while our planet is certainly extremely rare it should be extremely common that any life that exists exists in the rare suitable places for it.The eclipse lining up at the same time humans start recording history has no obvious necessity.

The usual argument for this is like the anthropic principle.  The planets where it didn't happen there is no one to complain about it, the odds of us being on a planet where we evolved are 100%.  The moon isn't like that.  Some aspects of it might be, such as stablizing the axis of rotation and the climate stablity that comes with that.  The convenient eclipse size is just fun though.  It's proportionally much larger than moons around other planets.  And it's not a uniform density either, attempts to orbit probes very closet to the surface failed due to anomalies in the gravitational field much larger than anywhere on earth.  I don't know about the "moon wave" thing, this is the first time I saw that.

as a christian, that sounds absolutely ridiculous. you might as well say the Earth is actually a square as "proof" of intelligent design

I don't mean a perfect circle.  I need to check that thread on how many people do believe the Earth is flat.We can go to the "edge" if that's the case ourselves.  No one is guarding the entire edgle.  It's just 1000's of years this conspiracy has gone on with no one messing up.  We go into space and take pictures of the moon, and from satellites.  I hope we all know even if we didn't go to the moon we were in space near it.  I think they walked on the moon.

No, the Bible supports a round Earth that isn't at the center of the Universe.  I can get the scripture.  I just went through a lesson on this.

There are strange hexagonal shapes on the surface of Iapetus as well.

Makes sense to me 

anything is possible

it has been, mainstream science has blacklisted alien/religious theorist's and tons of these theorists have said this, any evidence they find is usually laughed off, and often only published on websites like this or personal websites, and if you ask most informed people, which I've done, and probably shouldn't have because it's done wonders for my reputation i'm sure, they'll tell you how obvious it is that most mainstream scientists won't even humor alternative science, only doing so when it gets popular. 

The Moon is a pretty deep rabbit hole :). And it leds you down the path of realising that we know almost nothing about cosmology, and that most of our theories on it are at odds with new data almost on a monthly basis. Personally I'm convinced the Moon isn't real in the sense it is an organicly occurring satellite, I believe it was very much put there, by whom I can't be sure. A shower thought I had the other day was that if there is a malignant alien presence exerting an influence over our species, and IF there is a galactic council or something similar trying to do something about it, it would make sense that the Moon being the craft the malignant aliens came here on would give them some sort of insurance against the tampering of their affairs but other species. "Hey you, stop messing with the humans and leave their world!", "Sure bro, we'll just take the Moon with us", "But that would be catastrophic!" "Then I guess stay out of our business."Not saying that's what I believe, just a thought I had ;).

This is a sadly underrated critique. 

no they used cubits

the distance of 1 KM is still the same amount of distance if measured in Miles, but the numbers are different because each unit of measurement is in comparison to a control. Every measurement is just measuring the variance from the original control object. 

Upvoted for the kooky dooky 

But not the other half of the moon.

>>But all of those things listed have been proven as fact. Most back in the 70s. Any sources? Proven facts are documented.

um, can you show me any of those 4 things?

Did the 10 other people who caught them manufacture the exact same thing also?

Millions of astronomers over thousands of years and the first dude to observe this is a flat earther?Gimme a break. Obvious fraud.

Crow's videos were shared with the fine people studying atmospheric optics over at /r/atoptics and opinion was that the video was fraud or possibly a contrail.  No one else observes this phenomenon.https://www.reddit.com/r/atoptics/comments/4nxmwl/can_anyone_help_identify_what_is_causing_this/

true, i don't even really believe that

Yep.

if it were an artifact of digital recording the wave would likely move or change in state if the camera panned.  If you look at the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM&app=desktop) he shows footage of the wave not moving with the camera as he pans quickly, and follows it's original trajectory as if unaffected by the camera itself.

Good point

Why do you insist on misquoting me?  LOL.  Conspiratards will tell any lie to support their delusions. 

I need to get a USB camera.  Mine hooks up to my laptop and I can get it on my screen.  I'll definitely record hours of footage.  I looked for aliens for years and all I've ever seen is satellites.  On my space forum 1000's of people who are experts (with telescopes, ones 30 feet tall some have built) all say they have never seen anything weird about the moon, any planet, or seen any UFO's.  

apparently people have only captured 11 waves so far on footage. and some occur near equinoxes or during lunar eclipses

 

It does. We all ripple out. Everything we do or believe , our thoughts, mental energy travels invisibly all around us, and we are in a sense biological antennae receiving it, and projecting it. Collectively we agree on what objects and forms will hold all the energy constantly overflowing from each person in this reality. The Sun is powered by us ,by our energy.  The moon itself is a symbol of night, of dreams.  we all agree on what we dream together, and the forms this will take.

Other people are their own consciousness. You or I are individual. You talking to me is your creation. Me talking to you is my creation. We each create our reality, but we cooperate. Just like we are doing. Only we also cooperate in ways we take for granted. Like we agree to agree there is a sun over our head and a moon trailing behind it. It's automatic, the stuff we take for granted is an automatic agreement. 

 

I don't think it's a valid argument, I was making the comparison to say that I don't think astronomical coincidences (size and position of Earth, of the moon and so on) are very meaningful. It's like a lottery in which each ticket has an equal and vanishingly small chance of winning but there must be a winner. Given that we have a moon it has to be one distance from the earth or another. Seeing its current position as somehow too "perfect" to be accidental is a very human-centric position. 

A common thought is that Antarctica is actually a seawall all around the flat earth that is a circle shape.  This would explain the reason why all countries have forbidden Antarctic exploration on a mass scale. Then a dome, "the firmament", encloses our atmosphere.  The firmament is in Genesis. 

nobody goes to space, all photos and videos are fake

Link please.

Kinda hexagonal shaped. And there are other shapes that look like they could have been buildings. But this sounds like a very harsh environment, to harsh for life to exist. The spaceship theory was fun too, but I think we know enough about the make up of Ipateus to know that's not very likely either. But Im open for discussion, whats your theory if you think these were built? Why? or what purpose do they serve? 

That's nonsense and you know it. 

I second this.  I watched a presentation of his a few years back, thinking that it'd just be some more hollow earth ridiculousness.  I did not expect to be convinced, but it was solid, well reasoned, and not full of the esoteric imaginative gibberish that most hollow earth stuff has.

I'm reading this after I finish my current book, pretty excited for it haha

"but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollow."Thought we were discussing "theories" here?   In discussing the theory we need to look at the origin of the theory and what information supports that theory.  Then analyze it, talk about how or why people may use it to support their belief.  I know what the moon is made of.  I can Google scientific papers all day long.  That's not what I want to do.  I want to find new rabbit holes to run down and look at the origins of some of these more "nonsensical" theories.  But no.  You come in here all Logical and link all your "peer reviewed" research from accredited publications.  Great.  Thanks.  You've ruined this for me.  

They used cubits and other things I can't remember the names of... furlongs? Idk, but the thing is, the units weren't standardized; like a master mason might have his set of measuring sticks passed down from his father who he apprenticed under, and maybe even his grandfather etc, but his would be slightly different than another masons tools although they would both measure a cubit. It wouldn't really matter, as long as they stick with one per structure so it has standardized units of measurement throughout; it would be a pain in the ass to renovate a building you didn't originally build though... Anyways, my point is that it would be damn near impossible to align structures to true north or whatever down to the last micrometer like people insinuate when they talk about these things when everyone is essentially using a unique measurement unit, I'd assume that they're pretty damn close but not perfect.

So you think there are green (read about chlorophyll) plants on the *dark side* of the moon?  You understand why that wouldn't make sense, right?

No, because there arent ten other people.Thousands of years of Astronomy and one dude observes this phenomenon and no one else? Lol

It doesn't matter what he believes. The video evidence stands on its own, until it is properly debunked. His personal views don't change the footage, and trying to discredit that evidence just because you disagree with him on other things is pretty closed minded.

Ah interesting, I thought you meant fraud as in the moon is a fraud.  He claims some of the videos are from other people but who knows if that's true

Sad, wonder why there used to be so much activity and now almost nothing. There are some theories saying they camouflage themselves somehow, need IR camera and stuff like that.But I suppose who knows at this point, you could make a bunch of theories up from that, maybe they're grouping up somewhere, preparing?Wishful thinking I know, besides we have those who believe they are demons. 

I fully understand what the terminology means. The Matrix is way over populated. It is also not mega advanced tech wise. Some people who have a NDE can clearly see the "White Light" at death is completely staged and somewhat synthetic and even crappy. People all over the world have been experiencing "Glitches In The Matrix". From identical people, cars, locations and objects completely respawning, to the projection actually freezing and the characters and objects around them staying in place for numerous seconds.

It's a bit tautological too. If it wasn't "perfect" (e.g. close enough to evolve life that can get intelligent), we wouldn't be here to realize it. 

But how is it too perfect? Why would it being seemingly the same size as the sun in our sky bare any real significance? What does factthat solar eclipses happen sometimes actually change in our lives, other than a few moments to go "oooo". The moon could be a different size or distance and tides would still happen, which is a much more significant phenomena to aid the growth and spread of life than eclipses. 

if i thought it was nonsense, i wouldn't have said it, and if your counter is just calling me delusional or crazy that's not an argument. Call me stupid all you want but mainstream everything, from politics to science is constantly caught cheating, lying, stealing, and blackmailing as well as blacklisting things they don't like, only people who don't like the truth blindly believe they don't exclude narratives  they don't like. 

yeah, i researched hollow theory quite a bit and did a presentation on it for my chemistry class for a pseudoscience assignment. it actually stirred my curiosity on to look into other "conspiracies." my conclusion is that until we have the technology to dig past our crust, we'd have to rely on assumptions given through how the seismic data is interpreated

[Holy moly.  It's  not literally dark, dude.  It's tidally locked & we only ever see one side.  The moon has days and nights, just like us.](http://earthsky.org/space/five-myths-about-the-moon)  #5

I don't think so, but no one from earth's perspective ever sees the dark side of the moon.

Uh I'm reading the book and so far all I can find is that he's citing other books, namely  Jessup, Morris K. (1957). The Expanding Case for the UFO. New York: Citadel PressandStrange World of the Moon - 1962 (by VA Firsoff)Neither of these are in print.Swann refers to Firsoff as a top scientist and authority on the moon. This seems to a be a pretty strong embellishment based on what can be found about the man.MK Jessup is a better known ufologist who was at one point a PhD candidate but it's not clear that he ever finished his degree or worked in science in any capacity after that point.I'd say this is a pretty weak source overall.

Try thinking.  Maybe the wave wasn't there thousands of years ago.  Maybe they didn't have high def cameras.Try checking before making a blatantly false statement.  This video shows 10 wave captures by people around the world.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM

Do you really think that after thousands of years of observations only Crow77 has ever observed this phenomenon?Do you simply believe every video you see, even when that video contradicts the personal observation of BILLIONS of humans over thousands of years?Dude, think. Obviously fraud. 

It isnt true.  No one else observes this phenomenon. 

Word for word?  Read it again if you can actually read, which is doubtful. 

I'm highly confident the "aliens" are fallen angels/demons.  I've had a lot of contact with them since age 14 when it started.  I brought a demon back from Peru and it will tell me it's name if I ask.  It possessed me and I started stabbing myself with the Peruvian knife (turns out it's the Peruvian God of war carved on the knife and they pray over it).

 

/r/glitch_in_the_matrix

its a bit far-reaching for me, but there are footage of planes stopping in the middle of air for a brief second before continuing. or planes simply vanishing like someone turned off a hologram

Been fun larping w/ u

It's not tautological at all... cogito (or in this case, typito) ergo sum.I'm here, and no matter your belief in a fancy-shmancy CIA holo-projected universe, I really did type this, and this planet *is* a Goldilocks planet.And the chance that non-pernicious info is folded into every single species' DNA quadrillions of times, with a way to circumvent RNA's non-conforming-therefore-discarded policy is a number so large that it would require every molecule in the universe to count it out on a cosmic abacus.

Maybe it was created by people for people to wonder at, to block out the sun and show a display of power. IDK why you would involve religion/creationism at all unless that was your own neurosis.

Well their argument, which I think is fallacious, is that if quite a few of the conditions on earth weren't *exactly* as they are, we wouldn't be here. That may be true but all it means is that something else would be here. There's obviously no basis to believe someone or something arranged it this way to suit us. The argument seems to be assuming that there is something essential about human life and a universe without us would be a pointless mistake. 

>  if your counter is just calling me delusional or crazy that's not an argument. Call me stupid all you want   I didn't call you any of those things, but if you insist let's go ahead and put this to the test.   Show me one of these papers published on a website that was rejected from peer reviewed journals, which has empirical evidence of the Moon's atmosphere supporting liquid water and greenery. All it would take is a few spectroscopic measurements, anyone with access to a telescope and some basic equipment can carry that out and publish their data, so where is it? 

During the Dark Ages they burned people as witches because they believed the earth circled the sun and not the other way around.  It was literally a period in history where discussing science, alternative theories of evolution, cosmology and mathematics could get you killed.  New ideas, new belief systems were harshly and violently suppressed.  If anything is dragging us back to the Dark Ages, it's people like you who refuse to even discuss a different point of view.  

Huh. Fair point.  Now can you suggest any reason why only the side we can't see would have vegetation?

Why do you need a camera? Because you cant fake waves on the actual moon, but you can on video.All these "waves" are all in the same video released by the same person, lol You are being duped by someone that pushes pseudoscience to get subscriptions.  

LOL I am still laughing about this.  Where are the source videos, Crow?  I cant believe you took that video seriously.

I'm not saying you're wrong. You could be right.Where is it implied or suggested that this phenomenon is "thousands of years old?" For all we know this was first observed in the last few years because that's when it started. What evidence do you have for a fraud, other than an absence of evidence for it being a real phenomenon? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.I'm not suggesting anything, just pointing out what we can all see on the video. If you can explain how to achieve these effects within the constraints and also explain how a third party independently observed them from a different location, with separate evidence for it, then we can call it debunked and carry on with our lives. 

Good to know, thanks!

I'm still open to entertain that idea, but there's also the possibility of that kind of thing being a "distraction" or "misinfo". I just honestly don't know what to give more credence to.  The beings could be friendly and trying to help, but "they" don't want that, so they're demons or malevolent aliens. But on the flip side, they could be evil aliens or demons sure, and the people shouting the benevolent aliens idea could be trying to get us to trust these beings who mean harm. I'm just anxious about the future and hoping this is all coming to a culmination, but I know there have been others like me waiting for an "event" as well and they've died with nothing occurring. Let's hope there's something to this "Great" Eclipse and the 23rd that follows.EDIT: I also mean to try more psychedelics hopefully in the nearby future, I want to see what my consciousness has to say about all the information I have cooped up in there. 

Part of the fun of r/conspiracy is entertaining the possibility. Or at least it used to be. 

Got any links?

factthat we have DNA is statistically slim?  What?  I need more info.

But what I'm saying is why would anyone who would create the moon need to make it so eclipses are present. It has no real baring on how life came to be. 

Not to further an argument that I also find fallacious, but it isn't just conditions on earth.  All of the constants in the universe (Speed of light, etc.) are so perfectly tuned that if they were changed by on millionth of a percent matter itself could not exist.  It's pretty mind blowing.

oh, i don't believe the moon is hollow, or supports greenery, i'm insane, not delusional, yet, and it's fairly well admitted i believe that the moon has ice on it, you can literally just type in 'moon has ice?' i'm too lazy too bother, and drunk, but the liquid water thing is probably bull, although looking it up on google search brings up lots of times mentions of water vapor, so there might be a little. don't see what difference it makes. 

> During the Dark Ages they burned people as witches because they believed the earth circled the sun and not the other way around.Yup, and people today are still stoned to death, and there were death camps in the 1990s ... we're not so far from history.> It was literally a period in history where discussing science, alternative theories of evolution, cosmology and mathematics could get you killed. New ideas, new belief systems were harshly and violently suppressed. If anything is dragging us back to the Dark Ages, it's people like you who refuse to even discuss a different point of view.A completely discounted, illogical and nonsensical point of view.  It's this kind of 'science sliding' that leads to the coal lobby and other anti-scientific scam artists to hold so much power, they take advantage of people who just want to "discuss a different point of view" and allow it to grow into a powerful minority which ultimately profits only a select few ...

Well, that's probably pretty unlikely.  It has been shown that our moon has a trace atmosphere, iirc from impacts and outgassing, but it's  pretty close to a vacuum.  There  is ice on the moon, and a trace of water vapor, and the moon is capable of holding a breathable atmosphere for (I  think) thousands or tens of thousands of years.   And there are Apollo images that look like liquid water, and are kind of tough to explain away, but I would bet they are something else like impact glass or some other substance.   The moon is a trippy place.**But do I think the other side has air and vegetation?  No.**   I just like to pipe up when someone is thinkng the moon has a perpetually night side.  Space is so freaky and counter-intuitive that I don't  judge ignorance or superstition or conspiracy theories. 

Ok you have no idea what you're talking about.  It's been captured over a dozen times, from multiple states and countries.  But you stay ignorant in your brain cage of rigid skepticism so closed off you cant even learn anything new.

seriously , people get so angry 

Blocking out the sun is a pretty badass thing to do? There's different degrees of significance between Complete Coincidence and Created by God. Maybe the Face on the Moon is actually there and it was to show an ancient civilisations perceived mastery over nature.

There are so many "coincidences" that it almost feels natural, you know what I mean. The fibonacci sequence and Pi happening so often in nature is mindblowing. 

Liquid water and greenery was the specific claim that I was refuting at the top of this comment thread. You were seemingly defending that point when you responded to my request for a citation.

Ohhh, son, that's a big leap to suggest discussing reasons why people might believe the moon is hollow will lead to an unregulated coal industry.I get what you're saying, but I don't think you stuck the landing there.  

 

> I just like to pipe up when someone is thinkng the moon has a perpetually night sideYes, this was a pretty stupid assumption on my part.  I can easily model it in my mind and see why it isn't the case.  I just always took the name at face value I guess.  It was an interesting lesson in my own ignorance.Edit:  For instance, solar eclipses exist.  I can be astoundingly stupid sometimes =)

Apollo? We never went to the moon

Then why is your only evidence a single video?

This isn't supposed to be fun this is a fevered rush for the truth 

Stick your thumb out and cover the sun, are you now a badass?

I think these things tend to lend credence to the idea of us living in a simulated universe.

yeah, i'm slowly getting more drunk, and honestly i don't really care about this anymore, i had to go over this statement like 3 times for errors, so have a good night, don't go to bed angry 

> Ohhh, son, that's a big leap to suggest discussing reasons why people might believe the moon is hollow will lead to an unregulated coal industry.I think both prey on the same types of mindset.> I get what you're saying, but I don't think you stuck the landing there.Certainly a stretch, but I do believe there is a significant 'trickle-down' effect when it comes to believing things for which there is no evidence.

Absolutely.

Pink Floyd didn't  help much.  ;)

[Oh, sure.   That's  what **they** want you to think...](https://youtu.be/ZNIFyy3i_1I?t=47s)

Well no because it only effects me from my perspective lol. If i had a giant thumb and blocked out the sun for this hemisphere it would be seen as badass by some people. Especially if they worshipped the sun.

Yes, but to be fair, I was a badass before doing so.

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

If we continued to simply accept what is known and proven, there's no impetus to discover new things.Liiiiike, alternative fuels that might replace coal and other polluting fossil fuels.  

Ha ha looks like fun

> Well no because it only effects me from my perspective lol.Exactly.

> If we continued to simply accept what is known and proven, there's no impetus to discover new things.I'm not saying that we should only accept what is known and proven, I'm saying that once a theory has reached a point that there is zero evidence to support it and there are mountains of evidence against it, then it should be treated as such.

Supposedly pretty crappy, but I like the idea.

Yes, exactly, putting my thumb out to cover the sun does only effect my perspective. Are you using that as a metaphor or something?

Everything is just relative to where you are. Just like you and your thumb, that's sometimes the moon and the planet. 

Yep, nice metaphor.

Here's the FBI Records Vault release on Tesla they dropped like a year ago... has some great newspaper clippings about Death Rays and such... https://vault.fbi.gov/nikola-tesla

 

https://vimeo.com/133170463 Zero Point: The Story of Mark McCandlish and the Fluxlinerhttp://ericpdollard.com/ This guy Eric Dollard is trying to bring back some of Tesla's work and make them applicable to daily life.https://youtu.be/x2baCg8SHGM?t=21m13sThis video does a WONDERFUL job at explaining Einstein's Theories and why they do not accurately portray how the universe behaves, and instead offers another theory that r/holofractal is largely based on. These principles are largely what made Tesla's work different.

Retired Lt. Col. Tom Bearden claims the EM theory taught in schools today is based on a truncated version of Maxwell's original equation set, and that the original version (not taught in EM schools and dismissed by detractors) may hold the keys to a unified field theory. In an interview, Mr. Bearden was asked why he does not personally pursue development of new forms of electric technology. His answer was simply "I want to live". He has however, left a trove of supposed knowledge that can form as a starting point for anyone interested in following the case.The original version of Maxwell's equation set included scalar terms that required a form of quanternion algebra to solve. Later mathematicians later "simplified" the equations into pure vectors (presumably for ease of use) but also assumed away other dynamic possibilities in our concept of the electric model.http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch4.htmIt also could hold the mathematical keys to understanding SCALAR ELECTRIC energy that Tesla also wrote was the secret behind his wireless electric transmission technology and the basis of his Wardenclyffe tower. Many people make the mistake of thinking that the tower was an EM Hertzian wave emitter like a modern radio tower, which would be an inefficient design due to the power loss being a product of the inverse square law. The tower was actually designed to be in proportion with what was later discovered to be the Schumann resonance (Tesla discovered it first). The idea was to produce electric scalar waves in resonance with the Schumann cavity, which would be amplified by sympathetic constructive interference. It would produce standing (scalar) waves of electric power encompassing the entire earth and would be receivable at any point on the globe.This may also be the key to understanding the current conspiracy surrounding Russia's possible ability to disrupt the electrical systems of naval vessels, as evidenced by the USS Donald Cook incident in the Black Sea as well as two recent collisions involving US warships in the pacific within just two months.http://www.cheniere.org/books/analysis/history.htmhttp://www.prahlad.org/pub/bearden/scalar_wars.htmI also found this interesting CIA doc showing awareness and a simple mathematic analysis of the above possibilities.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000500240001-6.pdfEdit: added some stuff.

Exotic weapons (not just "ultra-sonic") being used against diplomats, and people think there's no way they can be used against high profile politicians or business people, against dissidents or the opposition.[A post I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6tinw3/theyll_soon_wont_be_able_to_hide_directed_energy/)[Another about US embassy in Russia (Microwave affair)](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5fvhet/reminder_electronic_assaults_like_those_performed/)Recent news: http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/20/politics/havana-sonic-attacks/index.html

 

 

Other things to look into: the fuel-less engine that carried lindenburg on one of his flights, meyer's water fueled car, nazi tech (the bell), supressed cancer treatments, leedskalnin's levitation (coral castle).

About the subject of suppression of advanced technology. The U.S. government would not allow any technology to be invented by an individual that could pose a threat to its agenda. Image a group of people with tech more superior than the military that could overthrow the aristocracy. That would be a major pain in the butt to a shadow government that wants us all as their slaves.

Look up the connection between Trump's uncle (an MIT Physicist) who was given the task of sifting through Tesla's notes after he died. There are quotes from Donald saying his uncle showed him the notes. Pretty intriguing stuff

i have reviewed about an hours worth of vids (bearden, hutchinson effect) and they are interesting and suggestive, but not one shred of information, circuit diagram, machine, magnet configuration, that would allow anyone to test their assertions.  i am not giving up, i am building a tesla bifilar coil experiment now, with positive results, but find no help from the references yet.

The Philadelphia Experiment is a fascinating one. I personally think it's unlikely, but I'd love to hear what /r/conspiracy thinks about it! 

I've been researching history and ancient technology for about a year and this is by far the most applicable and understandable resource I have ever found. I highly recommend this report to everyone, it covers ancient symbology, technology, tesla and it's connections to today's society's such as the freemasons: https://thenarrowgateweb.com/2016/10/14/table-of-contents/

Something else to throw into this discussion, which I haven't had the time to research properly yet, is the idea that the two navy destroyers which crashed in the Pacific might have been attacked by some form of advanced tech which disabled their electronics. There's been speculation that it wasn't operator error or a computer based hack, but an actual energy weapon of some sort. Russia has claimed to have used such a device against the destroyer USS David Cook in the Black Sea, as well. Official US sources and most US media have denied these claims, but it's still worth investigating. 

[electric universe geology](https://np.reddit.com/r/mudfossils/comments/6vdl8c/electric_universe_geology/) the Missoula Floods were recent and they were plasmahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULuA1vVZhak&feature=youtu.be&t=1s

Just about every technology developed by humans has a weaponized branch, and this goes back to pre-history. (Rock can be used to crack nuts, or rock can be just as good at cracking skulls.)I'd think that if there's some type of technology that does mass-energy conversion better than anything the public is currently aware of, there's going to be some effort to keep wraps on it. It was bad enough that nukes proliferated back in the 1950's, and I suspect the PTB in charge of western countries don't want a repeat.So even though it'd be great for most of us if we had electric cars with indefinite range using a new power source, if the same tech could be used to make a "pocket nuke" and not need the usual hard to get or traceable materials, then we're unlikely to ever see it.So if it's possible for stuff like this to exist, then I'd say there likely is some effort to keep it hidden or painting it as so fringe that it'd dissuade most scientists from going near it, lest they get blacklisted or lose credibility among peers.

Vortex math, I'll provide links later

The only solid proof you need of the suppression of humanitarian/useful technology is big oil suppressing the most important technology to our race at this moment, which could save the planet and most of its species from destruction within the next 100 years or so. See: Trump- "Climate change is a hoax"

Thanks everyone for the great contributions! I've enjoyed reading these posts. This is the kind of stuff I love to see in r/conspiracy! Really made my day.

[Nikola Tesla. Why did Tesla say that 3,6,9 was the key to the universe?](https://youtu.be/5NHaUrm4QN0)

I have to say I'm skeptical of a lot of the claims about Tesla made here, but I'm willing to have my mind changed. So a couple questions for those who think he discovered/invented things that have been suppressed: * What are the specific Tesla technologies you think have been suppressed?* What evidence do you have that these technologies are feasible (other than factthat the government confiscated his research)?* Why has no one (outside of government) been able to reproduce any of these technologies in the 75 years since his death, or have they?Specific sources would be much appreciated.

Are there any subreddits that deal with these types of topics?

So, who else figures Tesla was using a base-nine numeric system?

Please share more

I hope this isn't a shitty thing to ask, but I have a very general knowledge on Tesla. Any books I can read that talk about him and his experiments in depth?

John G Trump got a hold of FBI's records of tesla's stuff, its interesting to look into.

Here is some excerpts from Tesla and what he thought of the current Theories of his time. More or less against them entirely.https://www.quora.com/What-was-Teslas-opinion-on-Einsteins-theory-of-relativity-and-quantum-mechanics

What I don't understand is why there are so many newspaper articles about Nikola Tesla but no footage. He lived until 1943 so there is no good reason why such footage should not have been captured.Does this lend weight to the [theory](https://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/nikola-tesla-mythology/) that Tesla was not who we were told he was? 

Part 3 is interresting. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq_viSR2Yhs) guy is being mentioned. 

 

I'm a little off-topic here but I've thought for a long time now that smart phones were brought about for the demise of the internet, or to put it more bluntly, the dumbing down of content on the internet. I've been a computer/internet guy for decades, before it was everywhere. For those of you who were plugged in during the early days you'll probably agree that in order to be a part of the web community, you needed a) to be reasonably smart with computers, modems, ISP's, and internet navigation in general, and b) have a fair bit of financial dedication to it. Not everyone could, or knew how to access and use the net so it was *generally* a place of *reasonable* intellect once you arrived there. Even the stupid shit online had a element of wit about it. Then came the smartphone, timed perfectly with Facebook, and suddenly any dickhead with a $0 upfront contract had immediate access to the internet in their pocket with the press of a single button. Suddenly the internet became a place of true stupidity.Most of what I read now on the net isn't sourced, isn't fact, and has 3000 comments from complete morons who all think they all know shit. No one is correcting anyone anymore (like the old days when unforgiving, vicious fact-checkers would verbally bash you until you plug-pulled and cried yourself to sleep), and the great, retarded circlejerk has begun. Look at any news post on Facebook now and scroll the comments. It's just 1000 toothless dickheads spewing unchecked retardation with 1000 more applauding them. The same happens for any news site that all encourage user comments now. This is the internet now. So why? Maybe the original internet community was getting a little too smart, or had too much potential? Maybe we were splitting from the pack becoming too innovative? I don't know, but it wouldn't be the first time in history where pockets of collective intellect were attacked, infiltrated, and/or disbanded. But by flooding the net with the entire population I think it dumbed us all right down and trivialised the entire space. Spelling in general is appalling, grammar is fucked, content is dribble, and ideas... well, what ideas? No longer is the net a place of *reasonable* sense and intellect, but it's truly owned by fucking morons now, breeding more morons with each additional comment and each additional user. Just a thought.

>  the EM theory taught in schools today is based on a truncated version of Maxwell's original equation setI've been looking at Electro Magnetic theory recently and there is at least one massive hole in it.  Everywhere says to ignore magnetism in calculations for simplicity and the theory still works.Furthermore interaction between a so called electro*magnetic* field and magnetic fields doesn't appear to exist.   The closest anyone has got to affecting light with magnetism was to change the circular polarization slightly, and that requires a medium, it doesn't work in air and wouldn't work in a vacuum suggesting it's the medium causing the effect and not the magnetic field. Short version: Light is supposed to be an electromagnetic wave but passes through a vacuum (electricity can't do this) and isn't affected by magnetic fields. 

I just want to leave a little hint here.    What is the square root of x?  What is the square root of negative x?    One set of answers is always present, while the others are not often considered.

I sorta feel like most Americans if asked about this would agree that the government probably has tech that is advanced and can do things like this.

Reading the post you made, following this link https://search.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1976STATE166451_b.htmlI stumbled upon an excerpt which was rather alarming to me:Firstly:>OPERATORS, ELECTRONICS TECHNICIANS, MILITARY PERSONNELAND THE LIKE.

THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY STANDARD IS 10MILLIWATTS PER SQUARE CENTIMETER (10,000 MICROWATTS).IT IS BASED ON MINIMIZING THE HEAT STRESS PLACED ON THEBODY BY EXPOSURE LEVELS ABOVE 10 MILLIWATTS PER SQUARECENTIMETER.Then:>THE SOVIET OCCUPATIONAL STANDARD IS 1,000 TIMES LOWER,10 MICROWATTS PER SQUARE CENTIMETER FOR A WORKING DAY.IN SETTING STANDARDS THE SOVIETS HAVE TAKEN AN APPROACHWHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH SCIENTISTS OFTHE UNITED STATES OR WESTERN EUROPE BELIEVE IS JUSTIFIEDBY EITHER SCIENTIFIC DATA OR **EXPERIENCE**.My interpretation of this, is that US Scientists have the freedom to set the level of *acceptable exposure* to anything they wish, based on experience? Would that be a possible explanation for such a discrepancy detailed between the varying levels of US and Soviet acceptable exposure?To play devil's advocate; Can anyone think of possible (TPTB) motivation for the US acceptable exposure to be so much higher?

How fitting that the CIA thread you linked above has a 666 identification number.

So I just was reading though [this  patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US20060144035?dq=%22John%20Quincy%20St.%20Clair%22) on the spacecraft. I have an issue with this line: >Moreover, in our dimension, the speed of light is 299792458 meters per second. Hyperspace energy has a speed of light equal to one meter per secondI find this very unlikely that the hyperspace speed of light is one meter per second. The meter and second are arbitrary measures created by humans. I suppose it could be on the order of 1 m/s but that is still a pretty huge coincidence. Maybe this guys is just "blowing smoke":>From experiments with the magnetic vortex wormhole generator, it is known that the proper combination of electromagnetic fields, together with this negative energy, can create a wormhole through which smoke can be blown into hyperspace. 

This is the good stuff, thanks

I, too was wondering about the John Quincy St. Clair patents. Looking through historical St. Clairs I found some significant names on the list:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_ClairNotice especially Jean de Saint-Clair, alleged sixth Grand Master of the Priory of SionWikipedia claims the Priory of Sion was a hoax fraternal society... that it was allegedly founded on Mt. Zion in the kingdom of Jerusalem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priory_of_Sion and all sorts of obviously made up legends about it. I wonder what the truth of it is?This site discusses how he claims to have communicated with pleiadians http://zapatopi.net/blog/?post=200604284330.st_clair_hyperinventor . Sounds like a bunch of BS to me. Certainly seems like an intelligence operation. However, it could be a way of seeding concepts into society. I'm not sure if any of them are viable though. Its interesting because these types of patents are typically banned by the patent office ( which was brought out in some recent FOIA documents which I made [a post about](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6t8y5g/sensitive_application_warning_system_saws_foia/)

that thing don't work, they wouldn't put it on cnn if if it did

Tellinger did a couple vids about the ancient structures in Africa that emanate a different reading in electro magnetism. Ideas from this type of research would relate to Where the ancients placed their structures. He and quite a few others call these areas points on a World Grid. At these points energy constantly enters our system:http://www.soul-guidance.com/houseofthesun/coordinatepoints.htmlSo like the elephant in the zero point room is 'How did ancient man use these areas?' [Ancient Structures](https://vimeo.com/user12206452/videos)[Tellinger on Ancient Africa](https://youtu.be/GkTj-NwLG0Y)What I think is going on is we are missing a piece. If we could ascertain all of the points in the world energy enters the system, then we just need a proper mechanism to harness, transmit, amplify, etc, that energy.  The pyramids for instance would be what this device was placed in. It's probably really simple too.But something like this, it's called a zero point antenna. Or a beginning of its concept:[Zero point antenna](https://youtu.be/WxhA9_PcR_o)

Leedskalnin just used car batteries hooked up in parallel to power saws that struck the limestone with a regular period, generating resonance and allowing the saw to vibrate sympathetically with the dtone, allowing it to cur through in a matter of hours. "Levitation" was achieved with tripod gantries, moving each leg slightly up at a time as a very large three-legged lever.Real ingenious use of harmonics and simple machines, it was explained really well. Wish I saved the video it was so interesting, look up coral castle explained maybe? 

Ah so this is how The Donald got his time machine!

Any primary sources for these claims?

This has been skewed and twisted so much how can anyone research this?

From what i have read, the original goal was invisibility; surrounding a ship with devices that emitted electro magnetic pulses. The ship was rendered invisible, but it also was spotted at another port miles away before it rematerialized. Crew members who wore metallic devices (watches) suffered worse effects, with the metal burning and sticking to them. Some people were stuck halfway into floors/walls, had mental issues, and sometimes would spontaneously burst into flames at a later date. Some theorize tesla's work was involved, others say Einstein was in on it... could be both. 

As far as I understand things, the experiment was real, but the teleportation stuff never happened.  That tale reads more like a pasta than any actual account.

I remember I became highly fascinated with it after watching some episodes on Fringe and then couldn't stop reading about it.

Teleportation experiment gone wrong. They took Tesla's paper and tried to move the ship in spacetime but fucked it up. Einstein was supervising iirc and apparently the crew members that fused with the ship was not pretty to see

Cool link! Lots of info there. Saved for later reading 

Dude.  The world isn't flat. 

The magnetism chapter (13) is insane but interesting.I still don't understand what they mean by calling this,the basic unit of the universe....http://i.imgur.com/pebYRWl.pngI skimmed through this websitehttp://www.coralcastlecode.com/ and it's still confusing to me.Is that shape meant to be part of a DNA helix type shape?And basic unit of consciousness or the universe?Is it anything to do with the Plankton length?I know they show animations but it still is confusing without enough contextto visualize what exactly that shape is representing.

I was on /r/army and the guys there say that the people on ships have horrible hours and often are deprived of sleep. I blame human error on these two.

I don't think Russia claimed anything, people claim Russia used it, The Russian government claimed nothing 

Add to that we still don't know how the Iranians took control of a US stealth drone and landed it. 

'links later' reminds me of Richard Linklater who made the brilliant film [Waking Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk2DeTet98o). 

So what do you say to those who say it's just simple mod9 math?

Euler?

Trump's denial of climate change is kinda ridiculous, but remember something. Often in science things are often widely agreed upon by the community that later turn out to be wrong.

[Hutchinson demonstrates Zero Point Energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO-1l0lXR_U)Would like to hear what others have to say about this -- I'm not too learned myself.People also claim that the wing of a beetle has levitation properties and I'm reminded of the [Egyptians'] seeming obsession with scarabs. "Beetles levitation" yields some good results on youtube.

It is excellent to see other people who are also skeptical of the claims made about Tesla. What I have noticed on this sub and elsewhere is that if you even dare question the many stories and myths surrounding Tesla, a lot of people seem to get triggered by it, no different to challenging Jesus in a church.It seems to me that anybody who sees [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0i-fWRjQeM), and is truly open-minded i.e. willing to challenge their own beliefs, will feel inclined to begin looking for evidence to support those beliefs. This is real skepticism.

/r/holofractal and /r/FringeTheory might be down your alley, possibly /r/AlternativeHistory to a lesser extent. 

Here is the linked quora thread in all of its greatness>Tesla opposed relativity theory and quantum mechanics, and was arguing for the aether theory. He made several unsupported claims that he discovered effects which violate SR. But then, he didn't even accept factthat atoms are mutable and consist of smaller particles and believed electrons are physically impossible...>From The New York Sun (July 10, 1935):He found time while surveying his own past to express his sharp disagreement with the theories of Prof. Albert Einstein. He announced that the theory of relativity is "a mass of error and deceptive ideas and opposed to common sense," and that "not a single one of the relativity propositions has been proved.">From The New York Times (July 11, 1935):He described relativity as "a beggar, wrapped in purple, whom ignorant people took for a king." In support of his statement he cited a number of experiments he had conducted, he said, as far back as 1896 on the cosmic ray. He has measured cosmic ray velocities from Antarus, he said, which he found to be fifty times greater than the speed of light, thus demolishing, he contended, one of the basic pillars of the structure of relativity, according to which there can be no speed greater than that of light.>From New York Herald Tribune (September 11, 1932)I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.>Some quite bizarre thoughts from Popular Science (November 1928), on electrons and radioactivity, showing remarkable misunderstanding of some already widely accepted at that time theories:"To account for its apparently small mass, science conceives the electron as a hollow sphere, a sort of bubble," Tesla says. "Now, a bubble can exist in such a medium as a gas or liquid because its internal pressure is not altered by deformation. But if, as supposed, the internal pressure of an electron is due to the repulsion of electric masses, the slightest conceivable deformation must result in the destruction of the bubble!>"Just to mention another improbability, the force tending to tear an electron apart is, in pounds per square inch, represented by the staggering figure of 256,899 followed by twenty-one zeros - and this is 513,798,000,000,000,000,000 times greater than the tension that tungsten wire can withstand? And yet it does not burst! Not even when it is hurled against an obstacle with a speed hundreds of thousands times greater than that of a bullet!>And ‚Äì more widely interesting in this day of radio ‚Äì this strange, many-sided man clings to the opinion he expressed in his scientific investigations published from 1896-1898, that the source of all rays we know is always a stream of tangible particles or ‚Äòcorpuscles,‚Äô rather than waves or vibrations. Even before the discovery of radium, Tesla expressed his belief that radioactive rays were of this sort, a view ridiculed at that time. When radium was discovered it was found actually to emit particles of matter ‚Äì flying nuclei of helium atoms, called ‚Äòalpha‚Äô rays. Tesla has maintained ever since that radium is not a generator but a transformer of energy, the emanations being caused by cosmic rays of immense power capable of penetrating all obstacles however thick.>And more strange thoughts from Galveston Daily News (March 13, 1932):"As I revolve in my mind the thoughts in answer to your question I find the most wonderful thing is the utter aberration of the scientific mind during the last twenty-five years. In that time the relativity theory, the electron theory, the quantum theory, the theory of radioactivity and others have been worked out and developed to an amazing degree. And yet probably not less than 90 per cent of what is thought today to be demonstrable scientific truth is nothing but unrealizable dreams.>"What is 'thought' in relativity, for example, is not science, but some kind of metaphysics based on abstract mathematical principles and conceptions which will be forever incomprehensible to beings like ourselves whose whole knowledge is derived from a three-dimensional world.">The idea of the atom being formed of electrons and protons which go whirling round each other like a miniature sun and planets is an invention of the imagination, he said, and has no relation to the real nature of matter.>"Perhaps no other has given rise to so many erroneous ideas and chimerical hopes. Everybody speaks of electrons as something entirely definite and real. Still, factis that nobody has isolated it and nobody has measured its charge. Nor does anybody know what it really is.>"In order to explain the observed phenomena, atomic structures have been imagined, none of which can possibly exist. But the worst illusion to which modern thought has led is the idea of 'indeterminacy.' To make this clear, I may remark that heretofore we have in positive science assumed that every effect is the result of a preceding cause.>"As far as I am concerned, I can say that after years of concentrated thought and investigation there is no truth in nature of which I would be more fully convinced. But the new theories of 'indeterminacy' state this is not true, then an effect cannot be predicted in advance.>"If two planets collide at certain time and certain place, this is to the student of positive science an inevitable result of preceding interactions between the bodies; and if our knowledge would be adequate, we would be able to foretell the event accurately.>"But in the spirit of the new theories this would simply be an accident. 'Indeterminacy' introduces into the world of inert matter a principle which might virtually be compared with the universal illusion of free will.>"Of course, there is no such thing. In years of experimenting I have found that every thought I conceive, every act I perform, is the result of external impressions on my senses.87.8k Views ¬∑ 

They didn't want him to be a public figure? 

Eh, no one is really who we are told they are. There is always some embellishment.

Film footage was not all that widespread in Tesla's day. And consider the events of the time, WWW 1&2, the Great Depression, alcohol prohibition, mass strikes and boy-cots, is it truly all that surprising that we don't have film footage of Tesla? And this doesn't even mention the slanderous pr campaign leveled against him by Edison.No, don't read too much into there not being footage of him. Cameras and film were nearly as ubiquitous as they are now. ;)

Footage was easier to control in 1943

Solid points. Phones are the trackers so makes sense to roll that shit out first. 

If Apple and other cell phone manufacturers now have "permission" from the "PTB" to release the smartphone tech, why do they still make large desktops and laptops that require active cooling, rather than implement this tech into those devices as well? It's because the cell phone tech isn't all that special when you look at the hardware.For starters, the resolution of modern phones is significantly lower than the resolution of a desktop monitor, so right off the bat less processing power is going to be required to display images. This was even more true when the first smartphones were being released - the first ones had abysmal resolutions. Next you have to consider how smartphones are used. Even today, as far as I know, "true" multitasking isn't available on most smartphones, meaning you can't have even just two apps open side by side at the same time. The marketing for multitasking is deceiving - sure the phone can cache app data so that you can open it more quickly next time you use that app, and phones make the app easier to reopen using some nice menus - but it's still not multitasking in the desktop sense of the word. Having only one program open and using processing power at a time makes for much less strain on the CPU, meaning less powerful processors that give off less heat are required. Add in some serious slimming down of the OS because phones don't need all the bells and whistles that windows and mac do, and you start to see how it's all possible. Additionally some manufacturers (Apple) control both the hardware and software of their phones, allowing them to optimize their software for their specific hardware. It's the same reason game consoles have comparable graphics (PCMR don't shoot me pls) to PC's - when you can optimize your software for the hardware it's running on, you can make much better use of the hardware. The explosion of smartphones in the late 2000s was not due to some crazy technological revolution, in reality it was just progress as usual. The *adoption* by consumers was the real revolution. Smartphones for power-users such as PDA's, Blackberries, etc had existed since the late 90s, nearly a decade before they were being adopted by normal consumers. And those smartphones that started to get really popular in the late 2000s? They *sucked*. Have you tried using one recently? I had an iPhone 3G up until 3-4 years ago (so until about 4 years after its initial release), and it was incredibly slow. Multiple seconds to even open apps after clicking them, stuttering when typing, slow to load webpages, etc. Those early phones  didn't "come out of nowhere", they just sucked slightly less than previous iterations.

SSD technology had a lot to do with this.  Smartphones no longer have any mechanical parts, all of it is done electronically.   factthey have made so much advancement in NVRAM technology is mostly to do with this.  Also you have to remember you mobile processor and laptop/desktop processor are very different, the mobile produces much less heat than the desktop, but has some limitations.

A basic course on processor design and passive cooling designs would do you good.

A few years ago? If you mean a decade plus then maybe I'd agree with you, but a few years ago I was watching youtube and playing games at the same time . . .

Very well put

Libraries followed soon after; I remember when I was poor and traveling I could always just go to the library to surf(although then it was alt.binaries.pictures.stuff and message boards.And the smartphone was inevitable with the current technology. You had all these people with pagers, then cell phones, then motorola and blackberry were competing to combine the two, and you had verizon's little flip phones with a GUI. Once you had a phone/camera/radio/texting pager the addition of more and more features was bound to be an arms race.People who get their news from social media sites(here included) don't deserve to be called morons, as long as that's not their only source of news. I used Fark for aeons before Reddit, Yahoo news before Fark, Netscape news before Yahoo, and dial-in BBS sites back in the day. It's easy to just live in a bubble and reinforce your own cognitive bias, but it leads to outcomes like the 2016 election. Once it gets thrown in your face hard enough how insulated you are from the facts, you have to wake up a little. Spend a little time on r/facepalm to see people posting BS on Facebook get theirs. Subscribe to r/askhistorians or other strongly curated spaces for as close to unbiased truth as you can get.I think this is a great time to be informed. You can research who owns the site you're reading, find out everyone's research methodology and the politics of their board of directors at the click of a mouse. I think most of the people yo're upset at are just kids. They'll figure it out eventually. We did.

My mum, a then forty-something housewife, was active on he internet in the late 90s. She's not *particularly* tech savvy. She wasn't then, she isn't now. She's not an idiot by any means, she knows what she's doing on a computer but she isn't *great* with tech stuff. Anyway, point I'm trying to get to: people who weren't super intelligent and/or super focused on tech were on the internet *decades* before smartphones became ubiquitous. I think your who idea doesn't really make sense at all. 

PTB = Powers That Be

Huh?? How could Einstein have been a distraction?  That is like saying Newton was spreading false information.  While no scientist can ever be 100% each discovery brings us closer to our understanding of the universe and everything around it.

Wow, I profoundly disagree. I guess Copernicus, Newton and even relatively advanced early civilisations like the Mayans were all just distractions and misleads? Science is a work in progress, not an absolute truth (even though truth is its ultimate, unreachable goal). Einstein did a mighty fine job of advancing human kind a significant amount on this scientific journey, especially when it comes to practical application of his theory (good luck posting on Reddit/using a computer without hundreds if not thousands of different applications of his theories). After a while, as humankind's pooled knowledge grows and new discoveries are made, his theories too will be refined, retuned and perhaps even completely rethought. This is, as I explained, the nature of science. I just wish he would have been alive to experience modern quantum mechanics, no doubt in my mind he would've had some pretty rad insights :) 

Unfortunately, pretty much.

I wish I could be him

I never took university level physics, but this theory as you describe it is not accurate.  A moving magnetic field produces an electric current which produces a magnetic field.  And that magnetic field can interact wih the electric current again.  I got this understanding from a video on electromotors I watched.  The experimenter was demonstrating how certain kinds of geometry can be used to minimize the electromagnetic resistance and vastly increase the efficiency of generators.

How is electricity unable to pass through a vacuum?How is an electromagnetic wave different from a magnetic field?

I don't see how that is a relevant analogy

But omens are shared in the same manner, however those can't be demonstrated. The difference here is that we can finally prove that people own and use this technology to remotely harm others, and if Russians have it, who the fuck else and what are they doing with it?

Can't that normally be done with speakers that play loud noise outside of human hearing?

It's an interesting interpretation, acceptable exposure discrepancy. However we have to dismiss symptoms/temporal illnesses and harassment stories (with testimonies extremely similar to Cuban diplomats), the issue that it was the only embassy with abnormal exposure levels (after dept. of state sent detectors to other embassies) and the use of aluminium shielding in the embassy.Discrepancy about safety levels are one thing, but I'm not sure what could be the alternative to the symptoms and harassment.

 

That does seem odd, I think humans perception of TSOL is kind of warped to begin with.Love your username by the way. Always nice to see a fellow student of Ra in the wild.

 

This "world grid" I've heard it referred to as the Christ Consciousness Grid. It is a series of lay lines around the planet with vital intersections at different critical points (Stonehenge, Giza pyramids, Mayan pyramids, and other historical locations that have remained hidden in obscurity). The Grid purportedly enables us to connect to other living creatures through an alternative sense. I've heard it referred to as the reason Multiple Discovery exists. Multiple discovery is when two scientists unknown to each other make a discovery at the same time.  The concept is that they feed off of each other's thoughts and ideas that are just "out there" on this grid. They are attuned to the same concept and therefore pick up on each other's thoughts, emotions, and ideas. Incidentally, there is a conspiracy theory that destroying this grid is part of the elites goals. It was part of the reason nuclear "tests" were done for so long in the 50's and 60's. It was also stated that was the true reason they are hell bent on controlling Afghanistan. All of this was shared with me personally from a very credible source. I've dug and cannot find anything regarding this theory on the internet. To be sure there is plenty out there on this grid, but no conversation/sources regarding a conspiracy theory to destroy it. 

These structures were obviously meant for something we don't understand, and their placement around the world lining up mathematically is unlikely to be a coincidence.  I wonder if our planet is unique for whatever their purpose was, or if every (or any) other planet is the same?

Interesting info. I had heard that there was a simple explanation, but still quite clever. Since Egyptians had access to primitive batteries, perhaps this was the way they built the pyramids, as leedskalnin stated. Thanks for the tidbit.

Lol those books about Trump and Baron from the 1800s are crazy. My theory is trump just named his son after those books or something. The crazy thing is they also mention a guy named pence

And since no one's posted it yet, here's the 4chan thread on it. Very fun read https://imgur.com/41omp1q

In 1943, as the technical aide in Division 14 of the NDRC, Trump reviewed and analyzed the papers of Dr. Nikola Tesla when Dr. Tesla died in a New York City hotel. The research was completed on behalf of the Alien property Custodian office in Washington DC. From February 1944 to the end of the war in Europe, Trump was the Director of the BBRL.[7]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Trump

Yeah this is pretty easy to find man. I figured it was common knowledge for a sub like this.

How?https://www.google.ca/amp/heavy.com/news/2017/08/john-trump-donald-uncle-mit-nikola-tesla-g-george-time-travel/amp/

For what I have researched Einstein was nothing more than a distraction from the finding of Tesla. Light is obviously not the fastest speed in the universe. 

3 people worked on it.EinsteinTeslaAnd Thomas Townsend BrownThe ship affected, emitted a sort of st elmo's fire around the ship right before it disappeared and reappeared again.U really need to search Thomas Townsend Brown. His daughter did an AMA a long time ago here.https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1y04a0/i_am_linda_brown_the_daughter_of_the_physicist/

I don't think we could explain that with currently held scientific principles. So that is probably why it's been covered up. I dont think anyone is quite sure what exactly happened to that ship.

A pasta? 

Sounds like the plot from a movie, doesn't it?

His link wasn't about flat earth. Why bring that up? 

Some later chapters get in to flat earth, personally I disagree with flat earth but I don't think it devalues the other parts of this report which are absolutely amazing, and directly in line with my other research. 

I followed along with most of the magnetism stuff, but I also failed to properly understand the significance of that specific symbol. 

I think that's the most likely explanation given the evidence I've seen; I was just throwing this out there to see if anyone had any thoughts on this. 

Looks like you're right. And it was the USS *Donald* Cook for those interested in searching for it.

Some researchers have also noted the connection between the Hutchison Effect and some of the effects observed on 9/11.

 

This is great, but doesn't answer the question about Tesla.  Tesla worked with electromagnetism, and zero-point is something else entirely.

Scarab is also generally associated with the Moon.'For the Egyptians, Cancer was represented not by a crab, but by a scarab (or dung) beetle, sacred to the Egyptians as a creature of immortality.  The beetle is clearly linked to the moon‚Äôs twenty-eight day cycle. It deposits its ball of eggs, rolled in dung in the earth, for the space of twenty-eight days, which is the time it takes for the moon to complete a full revolution through the twelve zodiacal signs.  The Egyptians considered the twenty-ninth day to be a day of resurrection, and according to lunar markings, there occurs the baptism of the beetle, when the scarabeus casts his ball into the water, opening to give birth to the young beetle.  This immersion and baptism became naturally associated with renewal and regeneration.  In this way, the lunar god was always declared to be self-created, never born.  This symbolism seems to fit very aptly for the sign of Cancer, so seemingly introverted and self-contained.' - Egyptian cosmology is much different obviously. They weren't ball earthers. So they probably did see many similarities of 'levitation' in the Moon. They didn't believe in relativity or gravity Theories.

Thanks for that. I might take a look at his [2-hour podcast](http://www.johnlebon.com/podcasts/jlbp1684-nikola-tesla-a-scientism-priest/) on the subject if I get the time. I'll have to consider whether it's worth it though, as I already take a skeptical viewpoint to the claims. At this point, I'm more interested in the proponents of the claims showing why they believe them. > What I have noticed on this sub and elsewhere is that if you even dare question the many stories and myths surrounding Tesla, a lot of people seem to get triggered by it, no different to challenging Jesus in a church.I'd say it's a broader problem than just Tesla. Among conspiracy theorists in general, there's a certain tendency toward dogmatic thinking, usually of the form "Authority A makes claim X, therefore ~X must be true and anyone who believes X is either duped or paid by A." It's just lazy thinking, IMO, and completely contrary to the type of critical thinking and skepticism necessary to understand our world. 

/r/fringephysics

Isn't he sort of right about the electron ? aren't they just probability fields, and not this finite sphere orbiting regularly around the nucleus?

Some of his ideas seem to be valid in Newtonian physics, but not quantum physics.  I'm disappointed to see him not just wrong, but confidently wrong about physics for which he apparently didn't understand, or even comprehend the mathematics.His predictions for the future would have made for an interesting world, such as broadcast power, but he didn't have the underpinnings to reveal the universe as it is.

He was snubbed by the tptb. They wanted to go in the direction of industry and economy . I don't think Tesla was a materialist, so he basically didnt belong in their club.

> Film footage was not all that widespread in Tesla's day.lol is this a joke? Do you realise that Tesla died in 1943? When exactly do you think film footage began?

Thank you. I was going to write this last night, but you did what was likely a more thorough job. It should also be noted that the ARM processors used in smartphones are running on a much more limited instruction set, meaning there's a lot less silicon per core, meaning a lot less energy usage, and therefore less heat generated. Also, you might have a quad- (or even octo-) core processor running at 1.8 GHz in your phone, but you can't really compare that to a modern quad-core i7 running at 2.5 GHz. The larger instruction set of the Intel cores means that it can perform orders of magnitude more FLOPS than the ARM processors, at the cost of orders of magnitude more energy usage and heat output. And in most (all?) quad-core mobile processors, the cores aren't the same. Some are clocked slower (or even different types altogether) to conserve battery life during low-intensity applications, and some are more performance-oriented for high intensity applications like HD video and 3D games. Most phones aren't doing true multitasking either. There's nothing fundamentally different about mobile processors vs. desktop processors; they've just been optimized for different things. There's nothing in their development that can't be explained by incremental progress in transistor size, fab techniques, circuit design, and software improvements. 

Ok I have something relevant to your last point.   Of course the iPhone 3 is slow as shit.   -That's apples planned obselence at work.   The updates that you have to install to even connect to the network on one of their dinosaurs will nearly brick them.  I'm fairly certain this isn't up to question either <citation needed>.   When new products roll out they make updates that basically ruin their old hardware to encourage consumers to buy the new product.   And when the new product runs normal the apple fan believes that their new product is superior.For reference I'm rocking a 2012 android that works fine.

My ¬£150 Moto G5 has a 1080p screen (the usual definition of monitors) and can multitask with two apps.Good points overall though 

 

My brain knows that, but I still say "peanutbutter" instead

its nothing like saying Newton was spreading false info..

I am speaking of mostly astro physic's. That is the one branch that we can't test our selves. Do you trust the government to give you the information you seek?

You get a moment... watch this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTqKnJvY13A John Hutchinson was a brilliant self described physicist with I believe with no formal training. His story is one of intrigue.

I'm no scientist but I wonder if Einstein's theory actually does apply throughout the universe, or if it is specific to Earth.

i want to be like him. buy a house with a good size of land then build a laboratory to explore building things like zero point energy devices or perhaps simply a thorium nuclear reactor so i can sustain my house off grid

Can you expand on the geometry aspect? 

Hey, just read your interaction and I'm curious if you could speak more to his allegation that electromagnetism doesn't seem to interact with magnetism? I'm not sure if I understood him right. But if that is what he meant, I find that incredibly surprising.  Like, if you had a super strong magnet, would it bend light? 

The Faraday effect is the name of the polarization effect, I recommend reading up on these things, it's very interesting.  Youtube too.   

Has to do with multiplication. Weird scalar stuff (from what explanations I've seen) generally has a lot to do with waveform properties. And in electronics it's possible to do waveform multiplication.Basically the square root of a negative produces an "imaginary" value. Mostly seen in some math applications with *i*, but there are things to do with electronics or physics where it's also noted with *j*. Theoretically if you do the right interference pattern for the multiplication to take place, and you somehow have an imaginary value input on both - then you can have the product as a negative result. If this applies to something like energy or power output, then there are some hypothesis for some weird results. Things like circuits that show energy loss as cold instead of heat, etc. And those things may break or not be in-line with most accepted physics models.

Only if you ignore that in the 60s the US department of state sent microwave detectors to the US embassy in Russia to prove the attack, and they shielded the embassy after that. It's the Cuba issue just a big speaker aiming to the diplomats considering the neurological damage? I think it's not that easy, but we can research more.

There. Are. No. Coincidences.

What the hell, who is this guy? One dude vs the NSA. I wonder what happened with the lawsuit?"NSA operatives can usethis to covertly debilitate subjects by simulating auditory hallucinations, characteristic of paranoid schizophrenia."This is quite interesting to me given that I kept getting these my senior year of college; at the time I suspected I was getting harassed by intelligence operatives but I had no proof. People I told this to thought I was being paranoid. I think its likely that I was getting gangstalked for a few main reasons: 1) I was attending a decently large school; these colleges are known to have agents monitoring and subverting students who go "against the establishment" 2) It didn't start until after I had glimmers of unity consciousness and I awakened to factthat other's wellbeing is my own. This was after several months of meditating regularly.  This of course accompanied a deeper understanding of the power structures that control our society and so I became more vocal about this; posting wikileaks stuff on facebook (which i later realized was being censored). 3) The auditory hallucinations went away after I moved. My experiences make me wonder if they experiment with these sorts of devices on kids at college campuses. Its difficult for me to find evidence of this to corroborate this idea, though.

I've heard about that theory the elites want to destroy the energy grid. It was around the time ISIS destroyed that temple in Palmyra I read about it, that they're trying to destroy the grid and anything on that grid that would help amplify the volume(?) of conscious energy like temples and other buildings and artifacts. And that they're doing it through proxies like isis. 

Very interesting. Could we apply Multiple Discovery to all the pyramids popping up all over the world at the same time?  For the sake of argument let's suppose the Mayan and Egyptian cultures had no direct means of communication , but they both got inspired to create these structures.  Where do you think this inspiration would originate?

>  I wonder if our planet is unique for whatever their purpose was, or if every (or any) other planet is the same?We won't be able to figure that out until we give up fighting ourselves and start exploring space. Good question though!

Ya, it's pretty funny though.  The going meme is that he visited and saw the future and went back to 2016 to fix America, his future knowledge explaining how he was able to actually win the election.

This is fantastic, MORE!!

Thanks but that is not a primary source.

That is barely even able to be considered fact.  

Care to provide any evidence to your statement contrary to all of the observations science has ever made pertaining to a universal constant? Quantum entanglement doesn't qualify either, as it is not a measurable phenomenon. We're pretty limited by our instruments, but I'm inclined to agree with you if you can provide some valuable insight. We know so little about the universe it's amazing. 

 

Any info on carlos allende, the mysterious informant from the philadelphia experiment book?

 

http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypastaBasically, because the story is so outlandish yet fascinating some people can't help but repeat it and embellish it and get everybody all excited by it.

Some later chapters get in to flat earth, but there is a lot of great content that holds up whether the earth is flat or round. 

because its in the linked blog post this is a reply to.   

Thanks for the reply anyway, at least I knowI'm not the only one.

Alright. Just wanted to put that out there.

Judy wood

I was thinking the same thing. Didn't know what to make of it. I still don't want to take it off the table completely, but I don't want get flat-earthed, either. Thanks for your comment.Edit: [Judy Wood's observations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vadSaWyiozg)

> It's a giant hoaxYep. People *love* stories, though.

Celine, you have just won yourself a new fan. I can only hope that your skeptical attitude rubs off on more people on this sub. There is lots of potential here, but too many people who have no apparent understanding of what skepticism is all about.

Yes,  a magnetic field. In 1925 physicists began talking about the spin of the electron. Shortly afterward they started looking at the spin of the Components of the nucleus itself. The spin isn't the orbital motion of an electron around a nucleus, but  actually more of a measurement of the electrons magnetic field.Probability field might be a better way to describe it. Because within this field is what I think is The Impression we pattern into it. So this field would be linked to our thoughts and emotions and basically linked to the blueprint of our perception.

 

> Isn't he sort of right about the electron ?> aren't they just probability fields, and not this finite sphere orbiting regularly around the nucleus?Geez, he was *this close* to inventing the [Improbability Drive^^^TM](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Improbability_Drive) !

Electron*s* plural, yes, but not Electron, singular. There's only one of them, you know. That's why zero point energy is possible; you're just tapping into it. It's funny, but what he called "aether", was really the same thing as "Electron", or at least is ubiquitous in the same way. 

basically, his ultimate dream was to provide free power to everyone in a period where businessmen found out how profitable selling electricity was

Do you think they had a film camera on every street corner? You know that at the time of Tesla's death most people didn't own a tv and saw the bulk of film in Theaters?Why do you think this is about when film *started*? It's about how wide-spread that tech was in the early 1900's and it wasn't as ubiquitous as it is now. People now take the availability of video for granted.

When do *you* think video footage became ubiquitous, might be a better question..

 

Yea for sure, I have no doubt there is some of that going on, but it has always been pretty slow. Like I said in another comment, the most objective proof against the argument above is the FLOPS of different devices, which never lie. Check that comment for a comparison of a newish phone to old game consoles; new phones still get blown out of the water when looking at raw processing speed. There was never some secret injection of technology to make a rapid advance in smartphones, just incremental upgrades.

Late to the party, but I enjoyed your post. As a fellow Android user, I assume that you need to keep the phone hooked up to a USB cord constantly, as the battery life goes to shit after a couple of years.

Alright, my bad. Recent phones (within the past 2-3 years) are starting to get much higher resolutions because of incremental improvements to hardware. What I should have said is that the earlier smartphones that appeared around the mid to late 2000s had very poor resolutions compared to desktops.This doesn't really "prove" what he's saying because his theory is that there was a large advancement in technology when these smartphones were first being released, not within the past 2-3 years. For more *objective* proof that there hasn't been some crazy advance in smartphone technology, check my comment below with the link to FLOPS for different devices. 

It does as far as we can tell.  The issue with Einstein's theory is it breaks down completely at the quantum level.  Many think because of this it is wrong.  Maybe, I don't know, I just know what they hope for is a universal law that can be applied to all things big or small.

What I know: electric current creates a magnetic field that spins at right angles to the electron flow.  Moving a magnet creates an electric current at right angles to the motion of the magnet.  A generator that runs off of moving magnets will create an electric current that generates a magentic field that - IF the design is not careful - will oppose the motion of the magnets (field of the magnet interacts with magnetic field of the electric current), thereby reducing the efficiency of the generator.I wish I could find again the video where the guy demonstrated how his design corrects the above problem in a hyperefficient generator.

That doesn't answer anything that I asked.

Well, then they are using waves, isn't that relatively common as well? Don't some police departments have access to anti riot technology that use waves to essentially "boil" people on the inside?

A desire to communicate may be a common tie to tap into each others thoughts?  It could actually be this. It would be the simplest response. Possibly without the disruptions to the grid I outlined the ability to "communicate" may be greater than what we could imagine. Maybe the reason for this fucking device I'm typing on is to further suppress this innate ability, as there is less of a need for biological long term communication. Instead of literally blowing up the grid, they replaced it with a physical communication device versus ethereal. Personally I have a different opinion on why the pyramids evolved all over the world at roughly the same time. I love your idea, and will have to give it more thought. Another simple answer is a similar culture that interacted with both with the intention, possibly, of increasing the effect of the grid. This culture would have either been very mobile, relatively mobile and highly displaced, or an unknown ancient sophisticated culture.  So obviously ET for very mobile. I think however we have vastly underestimated the ability of these ancient cultures to navigate the globe. They had a very keen understanding of astronomy and were obviously industrious. Displaced would be Atlantians or the like. Ancient sophisticated culture is least probable. If our "highly sophisticated" culture collapsed overnight we would be hunter/gatherers in less than a generation with little desire to construct monoliths. 

Hahaah who knows dude all I know is Tesla was doin some crazy shit back in the day, revolutionary shit

Source [7] is

Space itself can move faster than the speed of light.  Space is theorized to be made of dark matter/energy.  This is why there is so much research being done into the origin and properties of dark energy and anti-matter.

I could, though be better ingrained if you research yourself ;)

How so to what exactly?

unfortunately not my friend. but the story isn't complete. and our lack of understanding regarding this tech is out of our league. btw this is far as i gothttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Townsend_Brown#Legacy

Ok. I think most of them are. The Philadelphia experiment proves it in a way. So does many of other phenomenons science can't explain. It must be that the core scientific principles about the creation of reality are wrong, and so that prevents us from understanding these events with our current models.  The only explanation I can think of for the Philadelphia experiment is that two dimensions overlapped.  But I dont think I could scientifically explain a dimension of reality, and how more than one could overlap.I could do it metaphysically Somewhat. With a touch of science fiction.. Somehow they initiated some sort of portal through the veil during the Experiment. Entered this portal briefly, went to a somewhat parallel Earth, or even into another time frame of the Earth they were in.  But do to lack of understanding they didn't return properly.  They returned off center. They should have returned and be overlayed directly over the exact same space they had left. But there was something that interfered. They were in a state similar to how we think a rainbow is. A reflection off water.  In that type of state, and the people watching started freaking out and pushing buttons and actually interrupted it, and that caused the refocus to not be a seamless one.

Right you are, my mistake. It does indeed go into flat earth in the end. I'll give it a read nonetheless. Like you mention it does address a lot of good content. 

 

Thank you, and the feeling is mutual. I think it'd be interesting to poll this community to see how they got into conspiracy theories in the first place. I imagine for many, it was 9/11. The thing with that is, a lot of the early 9/11 conspiracy videos (I'm thinking Loose Change, specifically) made a lot of leaps in logic and tried to pin the event on certain players rather than make a thorough accounting of what we actually know. From "there are glaring inconsistencies in the 9/11 Commission Report," it does not necessarily follow that "Bush did it," or "Mossad did it," or "CIA did it." The official narrative is not our story, and we don't need to prove what really happened. We just need to point to official story and say "this, this, and this make no sense." The burden of proof is on them, and they have failed to meet it. That is a much stronger indictment of the official narrative than any of the various alternative theories. That's not to say we should not try to piece together what might have happened and who might have been involved, but I don't think we gain anything or persuade the fence-sitters by saying "this is what happened and this is who did it," if we don't have a rock solid case to back it up. Not sure how I got on the 9/11 tangent, but my more general point is that we're unlikely to arrive at truth by selectively picking the facts and patterns that fit a narrative that *we want to be true*. Even if we accidentally stumble on the truth in this manner, we won't be able to demonstrate it to others, and certainly not to critical thinkers. I think I was getting at the idea that many people's introduction to conspiracy was through the idea of learning a new "truth" to replace an old "truth" they used to believe. They never went through that often tedious process of looking at the arguments for a position, trying to find any inconsistencies or fallacies in the logic, and then doing the same for the alternate positions. They just accepted an answer that for one reason or another appealed to them more than their old answer. It was more emotional than rational. And if they never developed the skill of skeptical analysis afterwards, all they want to do is *be given* more answers that they like better. I'm reminded of the Gore Vidal quote: "I'm not a conspiracy theorist ‚Äî I'm a conspiracy analyst." The difference might seem minute to some, yet I think it captures exactly what we're trying to get at here. We should be striving to analyze all the facts and data we can get our hands on rather than try to project on them a theory that in some way makes us feel better about ourselves or our world. 

Care to elaborate on why you think our thoughts and emotions are able to control electrons?

i'm a huge fan of Nikola, but how can SR & QM be revised w/ what he's saying here?SR & QM are fairly well proven at this point, so I'm wondering what alteration would be needed to incorporate what he's claiming here.

is aether the energy present in a vacuum?  My only understanding of this is from Krauss with the experiment of to  panes of material in a vacuum still have some interaction between the panes.

> Electrons plural, yes, but not Electron, singular. There's only one of them, you know.Have I wandered into some Steampunk fantasy subreddit?  Do you have any evidence of this claim, subscribed to any reputable physicists?

Check out [this](http://pages.experts-exchange.com/processing-power-compared/) link comparing processing power in FLOPS of different devices. Even a recent phone (Galaxy S6) has significantly less processing power than last-gen consoles (that were released 10 years before the S6 was!). Care to explain what was reckless about the dismissal? You're providing anecdotal evidence about "desktop wars" and saying that computers were struggling to play HD videos in the mid late 2000s (???) and that somehow shows that smartphones are secret government tech? I fail to see how my response and the comment above are a reckless dismissal when they provide a rational, data-based rebuttal. 

Well, they actually made arguments, not something you bothered to do in your dismissal. It's astonishing to me how many people complain about and smear other users who dare to question their narrative, as if refusing to swallow information without examining it were something that is antithetical to conspiracy theorizing. In actually, it is the bedrock heart of it. If you aren't rigorously examining and even trying to disprove your own theories, in all likely you are someone else's tool.  

And this is a lackluster rebuttal. The original iPhone had nowhere near the processing power of even budget laptops of the day, in terms of FLOPS or any other benchmark. They didn't even have 640p screens until the iPhone 4 in 2010, and didn't have full 1080 until the iPhone 6+. I still have an old 2009 iMac with 3 GHz Core 2 Duo which runs 1080p flawlessly. No phone from that time even had a 1080 screen, let alone the processing power to run it. The latest Snapdragon 835s are certainly catching up with the i7s at this point, but it's been incremental progress the whole way. The 835 can even run Windows 10 at this point, and I suspect we'll see a move toward ARM processors into low and midrange laptops in the coming years. If your theory is correct and you have more than anecdotal evidence, show us where the government-released tech was injected into the market. Show us when ARM processors somehow got a huge jump in performance or reduction in energy usage that can't be explained by incremental progress. 

I guess embracing anything written here solely because it contradicts whatever is mainstream is the way to go?The guys presented solid arguments (in contrast with what you offered) and were subject-literate when doing so (again, in contrast with yourself).Maybe it is indeed time to move on.

I would've if this thing were actually in commission all those years. I've only had it a year and my friends dad had it for 6mo before it hit thrown in a closet and forgotten until my last one broke.

You asked about long accepted scientific concepts.  I'm not your science teacher.  When you read up on these things you might come to the same conclusion I did.  Or not.

Yes but these were used for covert harassment, that's the big difference. These weapons you are talking about, that were used in Iraq, operate in a frequency that it's expected to heat the skin, not the insides, but that's not the limit of the directed energy attacks, as the same principle (with different wavelength) can be used to cause actual internal- organ damage. If you are a strong dissenter or political dissident and suddenly you are remotely harassed in your own home, how are you going to prove this? Are your health issues enough to state that you are being remotely harassed with directed energy weapons? We know this case because the targets were diplomats, but we might be ignoring how countries that aren't very human rights friendly can use them. Maybe the suicide by bullet in the back of the head or suicide by polonium and other techniques not limited to hostile countries (who knows if the US does them too), might get a lot easier to perpetrate against enemies or annoyances. We need to bring this vulnerability to the table and push for regulations, shielding and detectors.

There are degrees of coincidences ..

Yea. I view our technology to be a reflection of what we do as a consciousness. More akin to what we do subjectively, or with our latent psychic abilities and subjective senses.  And yes the reason they are latent is because Materialists have basically ruled the world for a while. They have made everything about materialism, even our spirituality. But The web itself is just a reflection of the interconnection in the collective consciousness, right? When you drop it's materialism what is it?We could as a whole drop all the devices we use and then turn our perception inside out. By using our inner senses to do the same thing we use the web for. Or the phones... Phones are telepathy. The t.v. is a thought coupled with imagination. All things that send and receive data show how consciousness is a web of interlinked energy across a worldwide energy grid.So you could say Technology is showing us the nature of our own consciousness.

'Media not available online'.

Makes you wonder if the concept of aether in classical philosophy had validity.

 

Ah, this seems a good enough place to drop this word picture:> a somewhat parallel Earth, or even into another time frame of the Earth they were inIf we consider time in itself as a true dimension such as the 3-d of space, we can think of "sideways" time, when "straight" time, which aligns unidirectionally from past to future, is seen as a layer of simultaneous times separated from each other by contingency (that is, the many possible actions that could have been taken in this world but were not).We actually use this expanded time dimensionality quite commonly in ordinary speech and thought. We say "The British might have defeated the Colonists and the USA would not now exist." If that contingency (the American Revolution was stopped) had both been a real possibility, and then had actually happened, then there would at present be a "parallel world" in which we would have a very different political history (assuming "we" is meaningful, since perhaps "we" would never have been born). However, if we think only of the contingency of the most recent presidential election (had Clinton not Trump won), then the alternative "time frame" would be very similar to the present reality, just with us talking about different political events than the ones we actually are.Science since the Greeks has been pretty strong on the unreality of contingencies. Our linguistic structures are well-adapted to orient conversations as to whether what we are saying has happened, could have happened, is happening, will happen, or might happen. The very definition of science is based on throwing the statements about "could have happened" or "might happen" out the window.The exception of course is the science of statistics and probability, which deals with contingency directly. Like the weather, a flipped coin, a rolled dice, or any other randomly generated number cannot be predicted, because we cannot measure the multitude of influences that will cause the result. Like an atom discharging a subatomic particle to kill a Schroedenger's Cat, only the ability to measure any contingent result is sufficient for science to admit its reality. Hugh Everett's multi-universe interpretation of quantum-scale randomness is the suggestion that two parallel universes are created when the cat either dies or lives. The Philadelphia Experiment somehow transported into such a parallel universe, and barely made it back.One more comment: most people miss the implications of living inside an infinitely infinite swarm of possible universes, both at the largest (infinity of universes), the smallest (infinity of particulate structures) and personal (infinity of life-stories).

Perhaps the rotation of the earth meant that the ship returned to the same spot, but  the duration of time meant it appeared to have moved.

so this could be the "vibrational energy" i heard a lot of people talk about. Even Thomas Townsend Brown used pulsated frequencies to propel or "lift" his device.  I can only deduce that if thomas had something to do with that experiment > they were using his skills in electrogravitics to test the ship out.http://www.integrityresearchinstitute.org/pdf/ElectrograviticsElectrokineticsValone.pdf

Yea -- don't want to fall for it.

Of course.  Instead of looking to science I researched channeled materials for info about how reality is created. In the 60's Jane Roberts started channeling Seth.  Seth explained many aspects of creation, and dictated many books. In them he touches upon what he termed CU's,or Consciousness Units.  So I will take an excerpt from the web to show you the angle he approaches it from:Seth: "Now: there are electromagnetic structures, so to speak, that are presently beyond your (scientific) instruments, units that are the basic carriers of perception. They have a very brief ‚Äúlife‚Äù in your terms. Their size varies.Several units may combine, for example; many units may combine. To put this as simply as possible, it is not so much that they move through space, as that they use space to move through. There is a difference.[Note: This may seem complicated at first, but once we see that what Seth calls ‚Äúspace‚Äù is in fact the aetheric energy, it makes sense. Since the units are made of aetheric energy, they must use aetheric energy to travel. They are not self-contained ‚Äúparticles‚Äù that move through an empty vacuum.] "In a manner of speaking, thermal qualities are involved, and also laws of attraction and repulsion. The units charge the air through which they pass, and draw to them other units.The units are not stationary in the way that, say, a cell is stationary within the body. Even a cell only appears stationary. These units have no ‚Äúhome.‚Äù They are built up in response to emotional intensity.They are one form that emotional energy takes. They follow their own rules of attraction and repulsion. As a magnet, you see, will attract with its filaments, so these units attract their own kind and form patterns, which then appear to you as perception.[Note: This is easy to miss. Seth is saying that everything we perceive is some form of pattern built up from consciousness units. Since they do form all of physical matter, this is a very accurate statement indeed.] "Now: the fetus utilizes these units. [Note: Seth had been discussing the fetus earlier in the discussion.] So does any consciousness, including that of a plant.Cells are not just responsive to light because this is the order of things, but because an emotional desire to perceive light is present.[Note: This idea of an ‚Äúemotional desire to perceive light‚Äù conforms with cutting-edge research cited by Gregg Braden in his various books. The work of Garaiev and Poponin entitled the ‚ÄúDNA Phantom Effect‚Äù has found that a DNA molecule can be inserted in a cylinder with light passing through it, and the DNA will actually attract the light and cause it to spiral through the molecule!Furthermore, when the DNA is removed, the light continues to spiral as if the DNA were still there. (We will have a lot more to say about this in Volume III, as it relates to evolution and how the torsion wave forms the DNA molecule.)This is obviously a very strange finding, but we can see that Seth helps us to understand it; the DNA has an ‚Äúemotional desire to perceive light,‚Äù as it naturally attracts light into itself. This might not seem possible until we realize that all life and matter has some degree of consciousness, since it is made of ‚Äúintelligent energy.‚Äù] "The desire appears on this other level in the form of these electromagnetic units, which then cause a light sensitivity.These units are freewheeling. They can be used in normal perception or what you call extrasensory perception. I will discuss their basic nature at a later session, and I would like to tie this in with the fetus, since the fetus is highly involved with perceptive mechanisms.("Next session will be fine.")It is not that you cannot devise instruments to perceive these units.Your scientists are simply asking the wrong questions, and do not think in terms of such freewheeling structures.[Note: Seth implies that we can indeed design instruments that would be able to perceive these units.We will have a lot to say about this in Volume III, as there are several Russian scientists who have designed very effective torsion-field detectors. Also, this work has been replicated by Lt. Col. Tom Bearden (ret.) among others in the US.The pyramid work of Joe Parr, also covered in Volume III, clearly shows these fields as well. So, the latest research shows that since the time when Seth gave these readings in 1969, some scientists are now asking the "right questions."]http://divinecosmos.com/contact-us/privacy-policy/62-the-shift-of-the-ages-chapter-06-the-seth-entity-and-consciousness-units

 

"Proven"?Let's start with quantum *statistics* (mechanics is a bit too far.)  Just because the math helps us with predictions doesn't mean the philosophy behind it is right.  The way I see it, statistics is the admittance that we *dont* have all the of information about nature.Continuing with special relativity, it's about the furthest thing from proven.  We have no clue whether time is actually slowing or the idea that matter moving through aether affects it.  If aether has some weight to it (it can, depending on the model chosen to analyze) than I would expect matter moving through it to perhaps affect it.  As for length contraction, and mass increase as velocity approaches the speed of light.  I actually think this is really just enforced through book keeping, not observed.  What did your research show?

As we learn more about our solar system, galaxy, and universe, we begin to realize that an Einstein universe is less and less a true and COMPLETE understanding.What‚Äôs more, I am starting to believe that Tesla‚Äôs theories were proved correct,  most likely in his lifetime, and covered up by the government hence the reason for the FBI classifying his ‚Äúharmless‚Äù research. There‚Äôs more to that, but I‚Äôm still working on it.Just been looking at the facts compared to the propaganda we‚Äôve been subjected to and the lies become obvious.I‚Äôve looked at ‚Äúalternative‚Äù theories out there. I‚Äôve even looked at present day aether theories....they aren‚Äôt quite a complete picture either, so I‚Äôm still looking for answers. 

haha you're not gonna like it if you immediately appeal to authority, but yeah. And now you have to go seek it out yourself because you're a dick :P

Well put. 

I already know it. You're talking complete bullshit and I want you to explain it.Electricity can't go through a vacuum? How do you think satellites communicate with earth? The aether?

That's just a coincidence 

It possibly did, or at least the concept.  The problem with calling it aether by Nikola's time is it was a word already associated with mumbo-jumbo and any talks of such a thing had scientists laughed out of the community.In current times, dark energy is a proven thing which is once again being widely studied.  Except we no longer call it aether even though it has superfluid like properties.  While technically right, I think it is a problem in translation as the classical definition refers to aether as a medium.

Tesla could be wrong, but when such a genius straight up denies other mainstream theories, the least we can do is look into it. Question everything! Lol

Quantum entanglement moves faster than light.  Negative matter. The most credible way of sending signals faster than light is via negative matter. It has been proven, mathematically.  The way of breaking the light barrier may be through GR, General Relativity, and the moving/bending of space time. Though only in theory and one can not prove that NM, or negative matter, exists. This is one of the ways matter can exceed the speed of light.

Love the idea of sideways time. Totally connects to channeled info i like where it describes accessing other dimensions of consciousness as 'stepping sideways'Here is one example:http://www.eliasforum.org/exercises/inner_landscape.html

That's if the ball earth model is correct. 

Very interesting. I've always been a fan of these kind of ideas, although admittedly very skeptical, but this is all new to me so thanks for the study material!

This is a really buddhist way of looking at things and dictates more control to the observer than the observed. I like the ideology, and am curious about how it stacks up against what we currently may and may not know.

> Consciousness UnitsVery nice, good troll.Unless you're just fucking nuts.Show a single reproducible effect of this nonsense.  No?  Didn't think so.

will do, thanks 

 

> As for length contraction, and mass increase as velocity approaches the speed of light.When I first learned about *c*, my first question was "How do we really know, besides through math, that an object nearing the speed of light will have 'near infinite' math," and it seems like one of those questions man invented that cannot be answered through any known means and may take a long time to resolve a more thorough and definitive answer. It seems like the mass claim may be more of a distortion based on the amount of energy it would take to move a body at that speed destabilizing the structure of the object itself, like an explosion without combustion.What were the findings with mass when smashing atoms together in an LHC?

> And now you have to go seek it out yourself because you're a dickYou have nothing but a tinfoil hat.  Thought so.  I didn't subscribe to anything - I asked if you have anything in your hand besides your dick.Dick.

> Electricity can't go through a vacuum? How do you think satellites communicate with earth? The aether?You think satellites send data to the earth through electricity?   o_OAnyway the point is, vacuum is not conductive.  You can make it conductive under extreme conditions,  but according to EM theory it happens spontaneously in straight lines through millions of miles.   Or between a candle flame and a forest floor, whatevs!

 

My pleasure, I personally love the ideas. And I do view reality as created by myself in this way. Through emotional intensity and pattern. Exploring the mechanical aspect of it is all conceptual, meaning you are using an inner sense to actually form the understanding in consciousness so that you can then sense it. Every thing every moment of our lives is this process. We send an energy outward from ourselves and consciousness forms around it.Our interaction in this way was brought on by your emotional intensity and mine together. It had never existed before,  We brought it into creation through this process that Seth describes. 

Actually you just showed it with your emotional intensity. All the various units attract to it to create your 'outburst.' Everything you do shows how these units form around your energy. But they are not 'units' in the strictest sense of the word. They are more like fields.

Wow.

 

 

I applaud your critical thinking.  It's spot on.  The interpretation of the increasing difficulty in adding momentum to objects as their velocity increases can be interpreted in a few ways.  Religious prone human scientists, many whom reverse Einstein, have chosen a (helpful) *model* and ran with it, yelling within the confines of their echo chamber that nonsensical things are happening, and that we juts have to accept the unintuitive nature of these nonsensical things.  Something quite similar seems to be happening with quantum statistics.It's actually kind of funny when you think about.  It's plausible, unlikely, and in the face of other models (aether dragging is up there) we should be quite critical of the zealots who (incorrectly) profess they **know** what's happening. > What were the findings with mass when smashing atoms together in an LHC?I'm a logical and critical thinker whose taken high level engineering and modern physics courses but the science of high speed collisions is something I'm not well training enough to say anything with certainty.  On the face of it, I don't think it's possible to measure the mass of a moving object unless that 'scale' (many types exist) is also moving in that reference frame.  And when it's in that reference frame...oh, relativity conveniently (for it's non purposeful predictions of measurement) suggests that there is no mass increase!   (Theory being that the mass increase is for an object in a reference frame with different velocity / acceleration.)See, we can use light to try to obtain measurements from these moving objects, but we're dealing with a shadow of reality when we are only going by the 'photon' emission.  We don't even have much an idea what light really is.  By definition we can't see it in the lab / with a microscope.  It's (part of) *how* we 'see' anything at all.  The idea that light is a ripple in aether rather than a ripple (more technically oscillator) of nothing but itself; a self propagating wave.  Another quite illogical supposition when you really step back and think about it.  To wrap this up, I'll add that one solution to the frictionless seeming nature of the photon through the supposed aether would be that the photon literally picks up energy from this aether.  Some would call this the 'zero point energy'.---P.S: I wish the dude above would answer.  Probably ran back to his echo chamber

Actually, we have ways of observing things like time dilation very precisely, with for example unstable atoms. You know that the half life of that thing is like 20ms, but if you accelerate it very quickly now it looks like several seconds to you, which is a very strong indication that time dilation represents accurately what happens at high speeds. It's been checked so many time with GPS satellites too, but those don't get near infinite like in particle accelerators.

haha yeah man google it some time. It's fascinating. 

They send it through an EM wave which excites electrons in an antenna and causes current flow.Electricity is the movement of charge carriers which operate using the electromagnetic force.Either you're saying electrons and their associated fields can't move through space (false) or electromagnetic fields can't move through space (false).When you boil it down, people mean "transfer of electrical energy" when they mean electricity in which case you can use either definition in common speech.The action of the fields is basically what we think of as electricity. 

I think it is a grounded theory. Yet, it is still theory. I do believe that it is a snip bit of truth. It wouldn't be as main as it has been for 80 years if it were not something used as a partial truth and distraction.

Great write up, OP. I'll definitely be looking into the Seth Material. Thank you

And unfortunately his was quite negative, glad you stayed with the light side with your answer...

Nothing that you typed makes any rational sense.  You are a loony.  You're all shorts and sparks upstairs.  You're so far off, you're not even wrong.What happened is that I saw your ridiculous post, and chose to send you a little chastisement for being nuts.

Yes, wow.  You show nothing.  It's pretty spooky, if you believe that nonsense.

Ok you understand the commonly accepted basics, I am only looking at accepted theory and testing it. Let's take an example.  The light from the sun is an EM wave.   It is composed of a sequence of collapsing *magnetic* and *electical* fields.  Look for actual empirical science examples (i.e repeatable experiments) of light interacting with either *magnetic* or *electrical* fields.   There should be LOTS.  I've only so far found the faraday effect and it only works in a medium, and then only weakly (maybe it's the medium?).

There is another channel with info free and available , a continuation of sethian Gnosticism. Channel is Elias. Seth and Elias , http://www.eliasforum.org

Is this guy drunk or something?. I thought this was a discussion and not about getting wasted and making baseless insults on people posting about alternative views of science ? 

lol

 

I believe it. I must be a ghost it's so "spooky"

If you believe anything you wrote, you must be so, so high.

The stuff you believe is far more lol-worthy.

If you find anything this guy says to be meaningful you have a bright future in Scientology.

Nothing you say makes the slightest bit of sense.  There's nothing to discuss - you're just stringing nonsense phrases together.

r/alanwatts

I'm trying to compliment your insults but alas I've been ambiguous.

 

I approach every new idea with an open mind, but not so open that my brain falls out.You were apparently never taught critical thinking.  That must make your life difficult in many ways.

 

Your comprehension is scattered and weak, or you would realize I pointed out the flaw in your approach to the world.Good luck in your future disappointments!

 

> There's many benefits and alot less stress to the world when you hold most ideas in a "quantum" state in your brain. Things can be true and not true and both (silver lining, kernels of truth).This is literally the concept of "doublethink" from 1984.

 

> Oh so you can read, neat.And you feel no embarrassment about your naive ramblings, which are identical to a core tenet of one of the worst dystopias in literature?Hmm, maybe you could be president.

 

Hey! You can read!Cliff's Notes, at least.  It's funny as hell you posted swaths of text from someone else's analysis of the book - you forgot to strip out the [1] footnote mark.The original nonsense spewed by the poster I ridiculed is still just that.

 

I think you're confused.  I didn't see a reference to the CIA FOIA, or a link to a study.  Are you really criticizing my ridicule of the post that started out;>Instead of looking to science I researched channeled materials for info about how reality is created. In the 60's Jane Roberts started channeling Seth.There's nothing credible there - he even said he's abandoned science.  If you're giving this any of your time, you're wasting it.  Instead of this bullshit, how about a basic physics book?  I recommend Brian Greene. Or a history of Europe.  Either of those would be better than reading nonsense about cells "emotionally wanting to perceive light".I can't stress this enough - if you credit that shit, you're wasting your life.

 

You're wasting your time reading nonsense without the skills of critical thinking.  Garbage is still garbage.

 

The problem is you're not looking in dumpsters, you're looking up your own ass.If you're not smuggling diamonds, you won't find any gems with this nonsense.

 

> Do you always spend this much time discouraging people from reading different types of information?This is the funniest thing you've written so far - you dump at least five times the words at me as I write.  Remember that you researched 1984 and *literally* wrote me a book report?It's not that this nonsense bothers me more than other nonsense - you jumped in by making unwarranted judgments about me, then you couldn't let it go when I started criticizing your weak approach to the world. That's the reason you convinced yourself that I'm the one with the problem.That's some pretty strong self-deception you have going.

To say nothing of US state policies and practices prior to WW2, it's almost like our keepers learned of Nazi and Imperial Japanese human experimentation and occult/phenomena research and said "well hey that's a great idea." And soon thereafter "well hey the Soviets are doing it to too, we gotta keep up." I've done my digging and been disgusted by what I've found. As this may be the most confirmable and devious 20th century conspiracy by the US government against it's people (in the usual guise of being conducted "for" the people), it's still quite relevant. I have some questions for those more knowledgeable than I. Were systems like this already in play in the US long before WW2? Aside from Eugenics I mean, though it's clearly a precursor of sorts.  I've read pieces on E.T. disclosure in which former state officials coming forward to claim and hint-hint about Roswell and other events are viewed with extreme skepticism...largely around how much should we really be trusting former state officials to tell us the truth about anything? Are we being misled on purpose? Too good to be true? Branching off of that idea, were the official end of the program and the release of declassified docs a "too good to be true" kind of thing? Perhaps that out of concern for the public finding out about the program the state then disclosed part of it, punished some of it's players, thereby informing the public of what occurred but also indirectly insuring us that it no longer continues. Many sources I've seen claim that it was a small, niche program only known to a few select agencies and players...was this really the case, or simply an attempt to reduce the public scope the program itself?Is there any doubt that MKULTRA-style interrogation techniques aren't still being tested and perhaps utilized at CIA black sites?

Relevance to the topic:>I support this suggestion. However I'm more interested on discussing the modern devices and artifacts used for a effective brainwashing. Lets be coherent, these days it's difficult to provide LSD or other substances and perform a psychological "montage" like MKULTRA did to disrupt the victim, but technologies like military V2K (exploiting the microwave auditory effect: voices in ones mind) and other remote directed energy weapons designed to harm (ultra/infra sonic and microwaves) can disrupt a victim to the point of making a remote (re)programming possible, even guiding a harmless person to commit one or more "convenient" crimes.**CIA unethical non-consensual human experimentation:**>In August 1951, inhabitants of the picturesque French village of Pont-Saint-Esprit were suddenly tormented by terrifying hallucinations.

Has there ever been any material declassified or leaked about the Soviet or Chinese equivalents of MKULTRA and the wider patronage of 60s counterculture by the CIA? Considering how much more "blatant" their totalitarian regimes during the era were it seems surprising that neither of those two countries ever made any attempt to engineer a new type of culture for the latter half of the 20th century. Which is strange considering they both had access to more or less the same resources as the US on that front and that they *did* compete with the US in much more resource-intensive fields of R&D like nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Counterculture, helped the US gain enormous influence over non-aligned nations and left communism fighting an uphill hearts-and-minds battle around the globe. Why didn't the communists attempt to artificially manipulate their culture and reinvent themselves into something that would be more popular? Or did they do that and it just didn't work?  Closest that I know of is the Maoist cultural revolution and destalinization but those were both blunt political initiatives carried out in public.

In all, it has been reported that Bender administered electroconvulsive therapy to at least 100 children ranging in age from three years old to 12 years, with some reports indicating the total may be twice that number. One source reports that, inclusive of Bender's work, electroconvulsive treatment was used on more than 500 children at Bellevue Hospital from 1942 to 1956**, and then at Creedmoor State Hospital Children's Service from 1956 to 1969. Bender was a confident and dogmatic woman, who bristled at criticism, oftentimes refused to acknowledge reality even when it stood starkly before her.>**One six-year-old boy, after being shocked several times, went from being a shy, withdrawn child to acting increasingly aggressive and violent. Another child, a seven-year-old girl, following five electroshock sessions had become nearly catatonic.**>Years later, **another of Bender's young patients who became overly aggressive after about 20 treatments, now grown, was convicted in court as a "multiple murderer."** (*before the word "serial killer" existed.. almost makes you think they were created* OP's thoughts) Others, in adulthood, reportedly were in and of trouble and prison for a battery of petty and violent crimes. **A 1954 scientific study of about 50 of Bender's young electroshock patients, conducted by two psychologists, found that nearly all were worse off after the "therapy" and that some had become suicidal after treatment.** One of the children studied in 1954 was the son of well-known writer Jacqueline Susann, author of the bestselling novel "Valley of the Dolls." Susann's son, Guy, was diagnosed with autism shortly after birth and, when he was three years old, Dr. Bender convinced Susann and her husband that Guy could be successfully treated with electroshock therapy. Guy returned home from Bender's care a nearly lifeless child. Susann later told people that Bender had "destroyed" her son. >About the same time Dr. Bender was conducting her electroshock experiments, **she was also widely experimenting on autistic and schizophrenic children with what she termed other "treatment endeavors." These included use of a wide array of psycho-pharmaceutical agents**, several provided to her by the Sandoz Chemical Co. in Basel, Switzerland, as well as Metrazol, sub-shock insulin therapy, amphetamines and anticonvulsants... **a public mental facility, reveal that Metrazol was administered to them by CIA contractor Dr. Robert Hyde on numerous occasions in order "to address overly aggressive behavior."**>In 1955 and1956, **Dr. Bender began hearing glowing accounts about the potential of LSD for producing remarkable results in children suffering mental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Bender's earlier work with electroshock therapy had brought her into contact with several other prominent physicians who, at the time, were covert contractors with the CIA's MK/ULTRA and Artichoke projects. **There is sooo much more, including this chilling personal story:>"During the 10 sessions, each of which involved an injection, my sister and I were kept in separate bedrooms, darkened rooms, usually with someone present in the room, but I don't know who the person was. Occasionally, my mother was also present. At times, I was so frightened by the hallucinations that I screamed and tried to escape from the room. I remember once actually reaching the hallway and being forcibly put back into the bedroom by my mother. I saw a wild array of images - nightmarish visions, occasionally provoking hysterical laughter, followed immediately by wracking sobs. I had no idea what was happening to me. It was terrifying....>"Although each individual session was often terrifying, any lasting effects of the LSD unfolded gradually. In the weeks immediately following the final session, I experienced frequent nightmares - visions of crawling insects, horrible masks, etc. I couldn't sleep. I was afraid to shut my eyes. I became afraid of the dark. My parents were dismissive and unsympathetic. Their attitude was, in some ways, more disturbing to me than the experiments themselves because it meant that my parents had known full well that the experience would very likely be frightening - and hadn't cared.>"Two years after these experiments, during her freshman year in college, my sister suffered a nervous breakdown. I don't know the extent to which the LSD may have precipitated this. But my parents' response to what was probably a mild breakdown from which my sister could have recovered, was coercive and drastic. She had been asking questions about the LSD at this time. She was angry about it. We both were. We talked about it together, but I was afraid to confront our parents. My sister was not. The angrier she became, the more she was 'diagnosed' as a 'psychiatric' case and the more medication she was given. To this day, my sister is heavily medicated. She never fully recovered from that first episode.>"Our parents responded to my sister's anger in a way that frightened me further. I also felt tremendous guilt for not being able to prevent the horrors that my sister endured. Once she was 'classified' as a psychiatric patient, she was lost. Everything that was done to her in the name of 'treatment' seemed to me to be a form of ongoing abuse and torture.>"**factthat our father was a prominent, internationally known and widely respected physician - and his brother, who had introduced us to this LSD horror, was a prominent, internationally known and widely respected psychiatrist - made it impossible to expose them or go against them. Their reputations were more important to them than the health and well being of my sister.**>"Even when I subsequently confronted my father with the evidence that LSD had been tested by the CIA for use as a military weapon in the 1950s and 1960s, he dismissed his participation by saying that it was an 'enlightening experience, like visiting an art gallery.' When I pointed out that this was not my experience as a child, he dismissed it, including the presumption that I must be a 'conspiracy theorist' to propose such a thing. At the age of 91, he finally admitted that it had perhaps not been a very good idea to subject my sister and me to LSD.http://truth-out.org/archive/component/k2/item/91211:the-hidden-tragedy-of-the-cias-experiments-on-childrenFurther experiments where Ambramson and then Dr Bender begins dosing children with LSD:> In 1960, Abramson conducted his own LSD experiments **on a group of six children ranging in age from five to 14 years of age. **>Her initial **group of young subjects consisted of 14 children diagnosed schizophrenic, all under the age of 11.** (Because diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, autism, and other disorders have changed over the decades, one cannot assess what actual conditions these children really had.) There were 11 boys and three girls, ranging in age from six to ten years old.>Jean Marie is **almost seven years old.** She came here nearly a year ago after her parents abandoned her to the care of an aunt who had no interest in raising her. Marie, who prefers to be called Jean, is shy, withdrawn, and distrustful of most adults she encounters. There are reports she may have been sexually molested by her uncle ... Despite her withdrawn nature she smiles easily, and enjoys the company of other children. After receiving LSD on three occasions earlier this month, **Marie ceased smiling at all and lost any interest in others her age** ... In the past week, she seems to have become easily agitated and has lost any interest in reading, something she seemed to very much enjoy before treatment.

MK Ultra is done nowadays via EMR remote technology. See this book for more info:http://thoughtlessness23.blogspot.com.au/

These topics are all great, I'm interested most in mind control on children. 1996 presidential commission victims said they were raped, electrocuted, tie into cages, sensory deprIVed and irradiated. Children were held in cages and murdered in satanic ritual abuse procedures as part of terrorizing the survivors. Trauma based mind crreated sexual slaves used to ensnare powerful people on film with babies and children if a citizen did this we would use the penalty. 

MK Ultra is old news guys.  Much bigger and farther reaching programs now that is undetectable to a vast majority of the population.

I'm not saying everyone is doing this here but quite often I see people demonizing LSD when they bring up MKULTRA or claim that the entire counterculture movement of the 60s was because of MKULTRA which I think are two positions that obviously disingenuous to anyone who has actually done LSD, at least more than once or twice. Although they very well may have contributed to the culture of the 60s and introduced LSD to a lot of people who then introduced it to others I think if you look into historically you find that most of the people experimenting with LSD in the 50s were psychologists who bought LSD straight from Sandoz and then they introduced it to friends. Rick Doblin highlights this cultural movement among psychologists and psychiatrists in his many interviews and factthey were doing this research at Universities and involving grad students creates the perfect atmosphere for a cultural spread of psychedelic culture that was the 1960s. Obviously such powerful substances as LSD can be used to torture individuals or possibly induce psychic phenomena such as shared hallucinations but I keep seeing people blame MKULTRA when actresses in Hollywood have a breakdown or even attribute Marxism to LSD which I think is illogical and disingenuous. Most people have enlightening experiences when they try psychedelics and most psychedelic enthusiasts tend to be in support of individual freedom above all else. That's not to say that people havent lost their minds on LSD or it cant cause delusions and there is evidence that at least a few serial killers and murderers were part of the MKULTRA program including the infamous "uni bomber."

ooh, acid rock, man. These days, parents are dumb enough to give their kids mind scrambling pills that allow their souls to be malleable by retail managers skilled via mind control tutoring conferences.

Ongoing project, now we got Burning Man.

[The Last Podcast On The Left](https://soundcloud.com/lastpodcastontheleft/episode52-project-mk-ultra) did an ep on it that has some decent info.  I find them irritating though.  They also did a pretty thorough series on the Franklin Coverup which they kinda tie in to MK Ultra

Mkultra was allowed to be revealed in order to protect project artichoke.

Always thought this clip of Clinton apparently in a trance was creepy. His clip is about ~~1:20~~ :55 seconds in. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt7r_XFMT_M&app=desktop

Commenting so I can come back an post links later. Last night after a quick sear h I found a video for forced fem that has pentagrams flashing throughout.   If anykne wants to look into these things themselves there is a sub   sissyhypno on here also a few forced fem subs. 

Here's the search results from CIA.gov... don't forget to look up other MK programs like MKNAOMI while yer there... https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/search/site/MKULTRA

StarGate was certainly an offshoot of MKultra, but did they achieve anything? 

[The Empire Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRMT1eozxPg) did a good 30 minute piece on the human tests conducted by the US military on it's own troops since WW2. The MK Ultra program pretty much shaped the way the military conducts experiments on unsuspecting US soldiers to this day.

Here's a link to a 2015 film called "CIA Covert Experiments." https://www.amazon.com/CIA-Covert-Experiments-Olivier-Pighetti/dp/B01G96P9IQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505208776&sr=8-1&keywords=cia+covert+experiments- In 1951 the CIA sprayed a French village with LSD to test LSD as a combat weapon on the battlefield.  Quote: "It is August 1951 and an entire French village goes crazy. People are screaming in the streets and throwing themselves out of windows. 300 people are affected and 7 end up dead. 60 years later declassified documents from the United States reveal that the CIA conducted experiments on unsuspecting citizens." Folks can watch the film for free with a free 30-day trial if they're not an Amazon Prime member.

MKULTRA wasn't about manchurian candidates, it was about social engineering. The entirety of the 1960s counterculture was engineered by the CIA. https://www.gnosticmedia.com/manufacturing-the-deadhead-a-product-of-social-engineering-by-joe-atwill-and-jan-irvin/

I think the most telling, modern day example for  the continuation of MKUltra experiments was the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting. http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/01/ft_lauderdale_airport_shooting_suspect_he_went_to.htmlThe suspect apparently went into an FBI office in Alaska and complained about hearing voices in his head telling him to watch ISIS recruitment videos.

i was given drugs by undercover police at two festivals this summer that were not as advertised.well the second ones i didnt take but hid.  im being followed and harassed, a woman i was dating was an undercover or private securityi am trying to get the word out at more than a little risk to myselfthe rainbow gathering in oregon was a complete police operation, hundreds of undercovers there on day 1 pretending to be campers.  i am concerned my account may be silod so only police see my posts, all responses to me have been suspect.if this is the way it goes down i dont want to be part of the future, just mazes of lies as far as the eye can see.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Ewen_Cameron> Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron (24 December 1901 ‚Äì 8 September 1967) ‚Äî was a Scottish-born psychiatrist who served as President of the American Psychiatric Association (1952‚Äì1953), Canadian Psychiatric Association (1958-1959), American Psychopathological Association (1963), Society of Biological Psychiatry (1965) and World Psychiatric Association (1961-1966). Notwithstanding his high professional reputation, he has been criticized for administering electroshock therapy and experimental drugs to patients without their informed consent. Some of this work took place in the context of the Project MKUltra mind control program.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Memorial_Institute

Is there any risk in writing a fictional story that involves MK-Ultra? 

Thoughts on MK-Ultra techniques and their use in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay>

Kind of random, but I don't know where to put this. Anyway, I just want to say that this really is one of the best moderated subs I've seen, especially for such a contraversial topic. Seriously, I haven't seen anyone banned just for disagreeing with a conspiracy, which is honestly not what I expected when I first came here. It's much more interesting to read about these things when you can see the counterarguments, instead of just a string of deleted comments. Even though I don't really believe in most of these, I'm still a lot more persuaded than I would otherwise be. Anyway, just thanks to the mod team for being cool. 

So much shill evidence on Youtube to muddy the waters. Targeted Individuals, post your court-worthy evidence? 

All of these programs are ultimately being formulated and directed by humans based in the Astral Dimension who work for the Alien Archons. Mind Control implemented during the subjects dream state by way of Astral Travel done by initiates of the arcane "Mystery Schools" paved the way for this 100 years ago.

[https://augtellez.wordpress.com/mkultra-release/](https://augtellez.wordpress.com/mkultra-release/)this link has pdf's of original documents that are worth saving

Mind control is spiritually based in that demons are instilled into a person during trauma and then called forth to take over that person's consciousness and make them perform as required. In the Bible, in Acts 16, the apostles encounter a woman whom we could say fits this description. "And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying: the same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour." (Acts 16:16-18) Although the demon in this case gave the skill of divination, demons have been rumored to give other skills, for example: musical instrument performance, physical strength, telepathy, remote viewing, intelligence, foreign language fluency, and "photographic memory". When reading about famous people, many will speak multiple languages at a young age or have photographic memories. Robert Johnson was just one of a great many musicians rumored to have sold his soul for musical talent. Svali, who claimed to be an Illuminati defector, said that her fluency in multiple languages stopped when she placed faith in God's only son, Jesus Christ. The classic story of Faust is about selling one's soul for intelligence and knowledge - Gnosticism in a nutshell. What better way to create "super soldiers" than with demonic assistance? Finally, another rumored skill granted by demons is the power of persuasion. There is documentation of governments using hypnosis to obtain information from enemies during the Cold War. Cult leaders such as Marion Pettie, Jim Jones, and L Ron Hubbard, were associated with the intelligence community.

I think that so far at this point... and with the advance technology the Government has... we all are part of the MKUltra programming. In Fact, i think we are being programmed while we watch Game Of Thrones, The Superbowl, The Primetime news, Radial waves that our smart TVs, PCs and Smartphones transmit throughtout the air ... Subliminal Imagery and Sounds our unconsicious mind can easily catch without us ever knowing about it... Sound notes and words that trigger a certain emotion and reaction in our central-nervous-system. Certain ingredients mixed up in our cans of Pepsi or in our starbucks coffee. Classified components that not even Doctors are aware of... Chemicals that come from the mixing of plants and artificial substances made inside the ClA labs back in the 50's... Lots of money, wealth and power is put into this by the Elites of the world (Bilderberg Group)... and the only clue we have to it... it's the one left into the 90's card game "Illuminati", someone who was inside the Elite or somehow got this information put it all away in a children's card game that nobody even ever played... with the hopes (or maybe because he felt sad about us) that we can have a little.... very very little... glimpse at our true reality. Just a tiny glimpse, a foolish and inmature glimps at our existance.

Testing 

If so many people know for a fact this is going on, how is this allowed to continue/what's the point of it continuing if it's supposed to be a secret(ish) tactic? 

[Gnostic Media's MKULTRA Brain file](http://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/6FBA86B0-0C57-9FCA-5CF9-D742DA541AAA#-4411)

In the [latest episode of Porkins Policy Radio](https://youtu.be/cRGZLXKWscs) (second half of the podcast), Pearse Redmond discusses MK Ultra as it relates to Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing, Sirhan Sirhan, and potentially the 9/11 hijackers.

This music video by Travis Scott is a recreation of MK Ultra.http://www.eliteagenda.com/featured/travis-scotts-butterfly-effect-illuminati-satan/There's also a thorough background on MK Ultra here as well. I recommend OP include it in the links.http://www.eliteagenda.com/featured/mk-ultra-then-and-now-a-thorough-analysis-of-mind-control-part-1/http://www.eliteagenda.com/featured/mkultra_mind_control_2/

MKULTRA to me is the most boring conspiracy there is. Every thread on reddit that mentions conspiracy theories someone copy pastes a huge wall of text about "MKULTRA".It's a horse beaten so dead it came back to life just to be beaten to death again.

mk ultra is the reason i believe the "pizzagate" thing to be 100% true.https://imgur.com/a/GMeAjthat, and factthe every info on it gets aggressively taken down, in a so precise and organized manner that only people with alot of power are capable of.plus, it's not the first time a pizza place has been used as child prostitution hideout. "jojo's pizza".also, it's not the first time that hillary and bill clinton or their close friends the podesta brothers have been tied to child prostitution rings and sex offenders.http://archive.is/ruHl6

Great article thanks for posting 

I'm more interested in the mind experiments being conducted now. Too bad you have to be an insider to know about them.

The entire Evidence Of Revision series is amazing. Jonestown was certainly a mkultra experiment.Many people forget how close Jim Jones was with politicians. In fact, he was appointed chairman of San Francisco Housing Authority, where he recruited many of his future victims. From http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=33190*One of his notable honors was being selected chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission by San Francisco Mayor George Moscone (Layton, 105). The Mayor was one of his greatest supporters, even sponsoring a Testimonial Dinner in the reverend‚Äôs honor (Layton, 105). On one occasion, Jones hosted a celebration for Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äô s Birthday and shared the podium with Governor Brown and the Chief of President Carter‚Äôs Transition Team (Layton, 105). When Ronald Reagan was the governor of California, he sent the Temple a thank-you note to the Temple for all of their hard work in the community (Layton, 35). His most noteworthy advocates include President Carter‚Äôs wife, civil rights leader Angela Davis, Pastor Cecil Williams, and Indian rights activist Dennis Banks (Layton, 65). With such an entourage, it is easy to see why Jones had success Despite his outlandish doctrine and often erratic behavior.*

[The Men who Stare at Goats](https://youtu.be/1wTMSUFos3o)It's a full audiobook, but the last chapter is over MKULTRA death of Frank Olson. 

I just watched another link off of this link; Donnie Marshall. Have you watched it holy shit bone chilling. Some of the names in it are truly shocking and really makes me even more skeptical of ANYBODY in mainstream and anybody who dies to early. Shit is fucked up.

Absolutely. 

My reaction is exactly the same. We might be at the same level of research, I'm not sure, so consider these for thought rather than as authoritative, they're all "as far as I know."Truman created the what is now the CIA in 1947. The agency is the secret police at the will of the president. I believe that it works the other way around as well, in the Deep State uses CIA to find and use blackmail techniques specifically against the president. Gottlieb et al created blackmail child pornography films of government and university employees using MKULTRA child sex slaves. Let me repeat that because it blows my mind that this is not the only thing we talk and DO something about: Gottlieb et al created blackmail child pornography films of government and university employees using MKULTRA child sex slaves. CIA must have known about ancient ritualistic torture techniques to control the human mind. They definitely started the slave program before learning of the "Manchurian Candidate," which they claimed was their motivation.They pardoned the German mind control and the Japanese biowarfare/radiation scientists. The Mengele import was the most obvious and not even acknowledged by the 1996 Presidential Commission that I could see. They could not admit that they were bringing Mengele over so they concocted "German countryside" and "Argentina" b.s. EVEN ISRAEL helped Mengele keep his Canadian and American torture/mind control position of "Dr. Green" ("Green" is the head programmer.) They claimed to have found Mengele but let him go in order not to endanger another NAZI hunt underway, which is the biggest pile of ridiculous nonsense ever uttered.Mengele worked in Canada and bases all over the United States. His work or perhaps his colleague's work I'm not sure (because sometimes I just have to stop reading) was based on ancient and satanic ritual abuse mind control methods which allowed CIA to organize and create mind control recipes.CIA might have been innocent compared to the German and Japanese mind control but my opinion was that they would have done it if they had thought of it, so rather than "that's a great idea let's steal their work after the war," it was "our Deep State masters are multi-generational satanic ritual abuse mind control slave societies already, let's up our game against/with them by using the advanced German and Japanese techniques. I base this belief on factthat they didn't just steal the "losers'" work. They pardoned, rewarded and protected the criminals from retribution. Today the world thinks Neuremburg took care of the NAZI doctors and doesn't even know about the Japanese cooking people alive.Eugenics - I think you are absolutely right in stating that Eugenics was in place, because Eugenics is a natural precursor to multi generation mind control slavery. I also came to that conclusion. I think Rockfeller Eugenics, NAZI eugencis and Harry Armstrong making sure the NAZI mind control scientists were setup in cushy CIA university jobs are all intimately connected.Re ET in my opinion all ET info is a cover story for two disinfo campaigns. One, ET is used as part of mind control domination, it is a being so powerful that the slave believes he/she is being watched on an atomic level and can therefore not break the terror to escape.Two I think came later but that's just a guess is to use ET as the biggest false flag ever created in order to justify spending trillions to defend earth from the greatest danger it ever faced. William Cooper said that he was leaked ET info in order to disseminate intact but later realized that it was leaked to him so that he would be an unwitting disinformation agent.The documents were not released on purpose. They were stolen and at first the newspapers refused to print them. But they did, hence the Church Committee hearings. Helms ordered all of the MKULTRA documentation burned. The only reason FOIA has anything is because there was a box mis-filed and so handed over (which blows my mind because it would imply there's an honest person complying with FOIA in CIA when we know they accidentally lose Apollo Mission and Torture documentation on a regular basis).Stansfield Turner only exposed and admitted to what was already exposed on stolen paper, which is why LSD and not sex, torture and slavery was exposed. The senators were remarkably kind to him and he was remarkably kind to the universities that received the MKULTRA contracts. They asked him softball questions, and he in turn wrote to universities giving them a heads up that some information on them was public so hint hint wink wink might wanna destroy some records.Most of the FOIA material was financial and so didn't expose the agency to any trouble. NONE of the people involved in LSD or sex slave/assassin/secret courier were sought out or put on trial.No one was brought to trial, no one was punished. Gottlieb wrote a memo he made sure was public saying that CIA had given up on mind control because it didn't work. This was 100% lie. Not only did mind control work, by 1973 the electronic frequency weapons used on people this very day were already well under way. The MKULTRA program is the name I will continue to call it because we are communicating a concept, not being pendantic about secret code words and "it depends on the meaning of 'is.'" Semantics are irrelevant when children are being raped and tortured in order to ensure my freedom as an American. YES it absolutely still goes on today. Targeted Individuals are being microwaved and bombarded with EEG cloning attacks that create forced speech, voices in their brains not produced by soundwaves a recorder can interpret, remote influencing, and mind reading (I am not joking).Its complement is gangstalking, which uses the community to torture, harass and gaslight the victim in order to destabilize what's left of their sanity. The microwave and remote electronic brainwave weaponry is the MKULTRA mind control program, and the gangstalking is part of the victim surveillance and destablization.The MKULTRA weapons mimic psychiatric illnesses of schizophrenia and paranoia. Victims appear to have these disorders because they hear voices. The gangstalking and harassment require sensitization to the perpetrators' clothing or car colors and so to an onlooker there is nothing there when the victim complains of being stalked. But the victim recognizes the patterns and so can't understand why no one else can see them. That is the nature of sensitization. Buy a red car and suddenly you will see red cars all over the place. They were always there but now you're conscious of the color. The weapons induce psychiatric disorders and the gangstalking, harassment, gaslighting and surveillance create valid paranoia. Combined these make the victim appear to someone who knows nothing of these programs as if they are a paranoid schizophrenic delusional person who is therefore completely discredited. Because victims have no credibility, MKULTRA is now a worldwide program of victims being microwaved, having images induced into their minds, having thoghts programmed into their mind, having voices pumped into their cochlear center that interprets noise signals into speech. They are harassed with voices and text messages telling them what they are doing at the very moment they are receiving the message, ensuring they know that the MKULTRA perps have complete control of their lives. The perpetrators say things like "We are going to rape and kill you," and "You should kill yourself."In this way they destroy the victim, they decompose the life force in a modern process of what the E. German government of 1950-1989 called Zersetzung, or "decomposition." EDIT I feel this bears repeating, as this is still going on today:Gottlieb et al created blackmail child pornography films of government and university employees using MKULTRA child sex slaves.

Well MKUltra consisted of plenty of Nazi scientists who were brought over thru operation paperclip after the war. To say the least, parts of MKUltra was absolutely inspired by nazi experimental weapons and projects.

The mind control of MKULTRA is still being performed but not for interrogation. For slow kill. Dr. Cameron's depatterning and psychic driving is performed remotely:https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/6lwiwr/mind_control_cia_mkultra_the_secret_montreal/djx4jt1/

> the release of declassified docsSpeaking from experience, having worked on three DoD classified programs (now declassified), typically, the only reasons any government agency releases declassified documents are:a.)  the document's contents is no longer relevant. *b.) the document's contents have been eclipsed by later developments. * A good example of the first one is documentation on early missile tests performed after WW2 which led to further developments in guidance technology.  

ET, Roswell, alien spacecraft, they are all red herrings. Probably part of some other program that we don‚Äôt know about.I‚Äôve come to view conspiracies as such.1. If we‚Äôve heard about it, it‚Äôs probably false.2. If the government has ‚Äúadmitted‚Äù or declassified something they did, but then claim they don‚Äôt do anymore, they probably are doing it but clamped down on security.3. All government black-sites that we know of are red herrings.

Hello friend, I'm sorry to inform you that you've been shadowbanned by the reddit admins.Unfortunately, as a mere /r/conspiracy mod, I can only approve your comment and let you know about your predicament. I recommend you contact the reddit admins ASAP about the status of your account.That being said, I would've been a *tad* disappointed if there were no shadowbanned users in an MKULTRA megathread :)

Thank you so much for the Wikileaks link. Do you know is there any more than these software descriptions?

The leak and "Vanguard device" is probably just a wild guess, as [this is probably the Vanguard device the leak is talking about](http://www.calamp.com/products/broadband-cellular-routers/routers/vanguard-3000). However in my other comment you can see the rest of the story about modern MKULTRA isn't just an assumption or guess.

https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/kanye-west-reportedly-suffered-memory-loss-since-forced-hospitalization/Vigilant Citizen is a good site to read for MKULTRA info.

It made him go blonde. As so many do when they have a 'breakdown'

Didn't he go to a facility known for "rehabilitating" celebrities who had "breakdowns"?

It definitely was because he was taken to UCLA where Jolly West created much of the mkultra protocol.

I thought it was pretty weird how he met with then president-elect Trump just a few days after experiencing "temporary psychosis" and being in a psych hospitalhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dTQSON9dSk

Its worth mentioning that there need not be a 'one single program' that all mind controll is controlled by. Many independent programs, cults, and buisinesses can deploy methods of controll... So if you have a music icon with a lot of people making money off them, it seems plausible that producers may want some controll over these artists as a sort of insurance.  So there's that to keep in mind.  That said i have very little doubt that programming of this sort is used in the music and media industry.

Why would that happen?

 [A Mind for Murder: The Education of the Unabomber and the Origins of Modern Terrorism Alston Chase](https://books.google.com/books?id=av5iRXPoXZYC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) has a lot of dope on Henry Murray, the CIA/Harvard psych who experimented with Ted in the subject set.  He doesn't have any drugs or confinement or shock treatments or McGill U extremities. They were more along the lines of Milgram experiments or Stanford Prison experiments. Basically grad students would be assholes to the subjects and study how they reacted. The Harvard students got off pretty light in comparison. Not that they weren't in outrageous violation of modern human experiments protocol, but Kaczynski's twisted psyche was affected by a million other circumstances beyond CIA experimentation.  It is chilling in a way how much good sense is contained in the Manifesto. I wonder if the autobiography is ever going to come into print. I would love to read it.

Excellent, thank you!

 

This might be the single most important thing you can ever read when trying to answer the "why" behind both ritual abuse and MkUltra

Late to the party, I know, but found something weird. This was def a very interesting, albeit confusing read. Decided to look up DC Hammond (the speaker) and he has a website: http://www.neurofeedbackslc.comIt seems that he is now focused on neurofeedback. Not a word is mentioned about MPD, ritual abuse or programming. Was kind of expecting more...looks like he just straight up abondened all that stuff? The plot thickens.

Can you find another source for the transcript of this talk?A lot of the segues are pretty fantastical and these allegations beget a ton of scrutiny.I've been half tempted to contact the supposed DC Hammond and ask him about this speechI was hoping that link wouldn't show up in this thread. Seems too fanciful for me

The People's Church, Laurel Canyon, and Charles Manson, were all CIA operations. "Just touch your nose when I arrive at the truth." 

Yes.  Laurel Canyon Airforce Lookout/Laboratory 

Think-Thanks... that's some Orwellian typo. :)

awesome research and he has the docs

I'm glad there are others following Jan's diatribes. I've probably listened to about 30 hours of his unspun shows. I really love the stuff he does with Dr. Utter; Atwill is also an intellectual force to be reckoned. I worry that a lot of his arguments, however, rely on tenuous connections and fallacious arguments despite his repeated claims of being an expert on the Trivium. When you take the things he's saying in context with the lessons of M. William Cooper in his Mystery Babylon series from the early 90's, they certainly seem to buttress and confirm one another, and yet I've never hear Jan reference Cooper or the majority of his links. Have you (or anyone reading this) used his "brain" software that he provides on his gnosticmedia website? 

They are releasing a drama over Frank Olson soon on Netflix. I'm curious to check it out.

 

PTSD? From what? And how is it linked to the TV show

I've got FOIA-obtained documents on /r/psychotroncis, that prove the CIA was successful in creating mind controlled killers that wouldn't even remember they killed.

I'm going to be harsh here, but this is my honest opinion. Your wiki features disinformation, non-credible cases, and highly triggering material. No, you cannot magically deprogram yourself over a short time period or with special codes. Your writing is near incomprehensible in places. You aren't doing anyone, least of all survivors, any favors. 

How recently were you mk ultrad? Was it near dc? 

Yep. Just google "psychotronics". Also of interest is how communist used psychiatrists to undermine the west.https://books.google.com.au/books?isbn=141161822X

I posted these earlier to this thread, but maybe I should have explained better. Back when CNN did actual journalism: [CNN Special Report 1985 Electromagnetic Frequency Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ8eYZIwVHg) [13:26]It discusses Soviet and American technology. Note, this was in 1985, so the methods have certainly become more powerful and fine tuned. This thread has some Nazi and Japanese experiments, along with Canadian, British, and American: [Conspiracy facts: A brief history of human experimentation without consent.](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6z4ewn/conspiracy_facts_a_brief_history_of_human/)Remember that the Japanese were not on our side back then. 

This ones new to me! I had no idea that there were any British actors who had spoken out directly about mkultra. I might get my mum to watch Calendar Girls and bring this up in conversation.. she might find it more relatable and close to home. 

I think that the lasting effects have to do with what was learned and how it was applied going forward.  I wouldn't consider MK Ultra 'old news,' but more like 'square one' of a lot projects.

Do share!

Clone malfunction.

Remember when all those reporters started speaking gibberish back in 2012?https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2rWmpgWHG_0

Hypnosis is a technique used in the MK Ultra program.  This video shows Al Roker going under hypnosis in this video.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njE-YvyET2I

I don't really see the big deal on that one; he stares into the camera for a few seconds with a pleasant but neutral expression while the other people are talking.

What's the conspiracy with Burning man? Curious

This.

Their response. It's all horse shit, what her and her husband are saying...

Wow, I wonder what she really said? Their explanation (she just went crazy!) is clearly a cover-up; even uses the same dubbed video, knowing it's fake. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1Nih7at8eQ

Hail Yourself 

Yes, this even used to be in the wikis on Artichoke and MKUltra, specifically calling Ultra a "limited hangout." All wiki entries on mind control programs and psychotronics have been curiously neutered though- even when citing gov't documents like the .mil paper "The Mind Has No Firewall."

How was that plan supposed to work?

Why do you say this?  So little seems to be known about the actual chronology of the mind control programs and their relation to one another.  I have often thought MKUltra was a limited hangout as well since so much was purposefully hidden.  I wonder if the story about the known records only surviving due to mis-categorization are true?  If they are then that would mean MKUltra is a limited hang out.

StarGate the TV Show? I only ask because my "mentally ill" brother like watching that show and bought many if not all the box sets. It just occurred to me that the tv show stargate had a lot of hypnotic/occultish themes and  haven't seen it in like a decade.......

That moment you realize you're an undercover cop.

How are you being harassed? Sounds like you could be suffering from drug induced psychosis

i absolutely loathe rainbowsbeg for others' generosity so you can harass more people? nah, fuck off rainbows. do some good rather than beg for others' generosity.fucking bums

Cameron was an incalculably sick individual.

This makes a good bit of sense to me.

You're absolutely right, MK Ultra is everywhere, but people are too afraid to admit it, even people in the conspiracy community would rather deny it & stay ignorant.

Success!

if hillary and bill are indeed in the child sex ring, then the Don and his family damn sure are as well. birds of a feather.. 

If Jim Jones was in with MKUktra then did Jim Jones kill himself or do people think he faked his death and survived?

Jon Ronson‚Äé was recently on Joe Rogan Experience.  He basically says the whole program was a joke and Major Gerneral Albert Stubblebine was out of his mind.  Although, I though the most interesting aspect of the interview was when he talked about how infiltrated neo nazi/white supremacist groups are with FBI agents.  I've been making that point for a while not, and currently feel the feds are helping to create the current political environment for social manipulation by using higalian dialect.

The book got turned into an excellent [documentray series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAMIvDmWbQs)The twist in the end is amazing and should give everyone here pause for thought.

Can you link me?

Someone has got it locked down. Great post. 

Just wow man. Thanks for the great read.

> Gottlieb et al created blackmail child pornography films of government and university employees using MKULTRA child sex slaves.There's a whole lot there, so I'll just ask on what seemed your most ardent point- can you provide any reading or source on that part?  Was this one of the confirmed findings in the released documents?

> Targeted Individuals are being microwaved and bombarded with EEG cloning attacks that create forced speech, voices in their brains not produced by soundwaves a recorder can interpret, remote influencing, and mind reading (I am not joking).Mind reading sounds fantastical until you realise that your little voice in your head (subvocalisation) actually creates movement in the larynx. All you'd need is a powerful camera and a program which can decipher said movements. SVR (Subvocal recognition) is a real phenomenon, being studied around the world right now. It's no secret. Check out US patents even: 6011991 and 3951134. It's no leap to suggest that there's a way to do it without placing electrodes on the larynx.

You're a great mod

Maybe it doesn't and doesn't require much energy, like Snowden leaked information about ANT devices that are passive, requiring an "illuminating" device to work that gathers the information remotely.

He took down all his tweets about trump a couple months into trumps presidency. Not sure if he really supports trump any more 

what truth did he tell?  I vaguely remember listening to the concert rant, but could barely make out what he was saying.

Is it?

Do you think this will have any effect on his music

Jim Carrey is one I'm not sure about. Katy perry, Taylor Swift, and Ke$ha all are still under control. I don't think big stars like them will ever get a chance to go back. Too tightly controlled - once you give the handlers control (Taylor) or they take it early on (Arianna) they're not going to let big public figures ever get free like they'd do a throwaway slave. 

[Humans are free as well.](http://humansarefree.com/2017/03/project-mk-ultra-satanic-cults-how-it.html)

Of course this thread turns into an ad for Vigilant Citizen blogspam.

Yup. UCLA

Because he was speaking out against the establishment. Remember that "Kanye rant" at one of his gigs a few months ago? I'd recommend watching the whole thing 

You're welcome. Glad I could be of service.

I thought false memory cam from Jolly West and his branch of satanic ritual abuse mkultra defense. If they don't abide their suicide programming we will discredit victims with accusations of implanted memories.

https://youtu.be/9FUersarZuoNot much of a better source than a live recording. 

Peter Levenda's research on the Manson murders is some *real* eye-opening stuff...any other good resources on that topic?

Were they experiments that got out of control or did they want media frenzy?

Dave McGowan is one of the best I know of on the subject...[Inside The LC: The Strange but Mostly True Story of Laurel Canyon and the Birth of the Hippie Generation](http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/laurelcanyon/)> *The hippie movement of the 1960s, which began in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles and peculiar military and political ties to prominent figures in the scene like Jim Morrison and Frank Zappa are looked at with Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon author Dave McGowan.

> I worry that a lot of his arguments, however, rely on tenuous connections and fallacious arguments despite his repeated claims of being an expert on the Trivium. i share your concern. one example which immediately springs to mind concerns a riff on [this](https://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/) quote:"In the Brave New World of my fantasy eugenics and dysgenics were practiced systematically."i vividly recall jan exclaiming that the phrase "fantasy eugenics" proves that huxley was an idealistic eugenicist technocrat of the worst sort, while it is quite obvious from attention to context that "fantasy" in this context refers to the book itself. i've thought of pointing this out to him, but my last conversation with him ended badly.Q_Q

I don't have the discipline to build my own "brain" -- text files seems to work better for me.BTW here's [Gnostic Media's MKULTRA Brain file](http://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/6FBA86B0-0C57-9FCA-5CF9-D742DA541AAA#-4411). Lots of good info here.

Cameron and Mengele were just as evil as Hitler. Maybe more so.

i like your username :)

What do you mean 

If anything, he was murdered once his handlers no longer had use for him.

Yes.  Maxine Waters seems to think there's white people under every rock on youtube trying to kill her when it's actually a blockbuster video full of AI phones making the appearances of 'people' with contrary ideologies, when it's actually a fraud perpetuated by money‚Äî¬†Being actively used to subvert the union.Very good. 

Yup nazi and the Feds go way back. Shit should awaken people to all other the possibilities of crazy ass corruption going on even if it seem "outlandish". -NOTHING is outlandish when a government executes a false flag terror operation to knock its own people's sky scrapers. STAY SKEPTICAL.

Perhaps it was a "joke" as far as never having any real chance of accomplishing what it intended, but it certainly wasn't a joke in the sense that real people's lives were horribly and intentionally ruined. I agree though that Ronson had an interesting point about infiltration, always important to keep the threat of provacetwurs in mind...we've seen a lot of Muslim terrorists turn out to basically be FBI patsies, and I think they will need to reinvent different dangers soon as the Muslim thing grows old 

The Hegelian dialectic. A fine conceptual tool that becomes dangerous when adapted to manipulate politics.

Gives it more credibility to me. JRE is a massive propaganda operation.

 

You will see it in the second testimony [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BINQ4jiQFsI&list=PLB6770C417F73C849) in which she says at the age of 9 she was taken to Maryland to learn how to please men and one of the reasons was so Gottlieb could use her to blackmail people who affected money coming in.

Well said. Thank you for the comment.

Listen to saint pablo (the song) and then listen to everything after.

No idea unfortunately. 

if you follow katy perry, it's very obvious she's trying to break out. she's basically having a break down, her latest album went full on illuminati. but the biggest sign that she's no longer sold her soul: there's front page posts on reddit smack talking her, with tons of shill bots in the comments slandering her too.katy perry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQRFT4bZucjim carrey is definately aware. he's a sad clown after all, and highly intelligent. who knows if robin williams were ever involved as well, he certainly shows alot of signs that he was "aware", but he was always kinda a coward.anyways, jim carrey: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG9i7d8yfKQi feel like jon stewart is in the same vein too. the sad broken truthful clowns usually gets ganged up on by the illuminati until they're too depressed to speak out.

Which questions? out of curiosity

Theoretically, couldn't an adult be MKULTRA'd if they were temporarily reduced to a <6 year old state of mind via mass doses of psychedelics / trauma ?

The Woody Harrelson thing is always great to bring up. It blows my mind how this information is available online to those who bother to look.

Yes. He was triggered when she said "holy ghost." He explained to her, "well you know, you said the word."..

Do you have more instances to share?

""When I spoke to Serene's doctor yesterday, he told me she had the complete head-to-toe workup, everything was evaluated according to a stroke protocol to exclude a stroke. So, imaging of the brain, ultrasound of the heart and the blood vessels in the neck and the brain, extensive blood tests. Evaluated by a cardiologist, as well as migraine specialists and neurosurgeon. No stone was left unturned and luckily, (they're) 95 percent sure it was not a stroke. More the classic migraine"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/serene-branson-had-migraine-not-mini-stroke/

True. What gets me about the clips of news personalities 'breaking down" like this is that these people spend an enormous amount of time speaking in front of a camera, and of course they're going to fuck up now and again.Some are stranger than others, no question, but framing every brief pause as an mk ultra glitch seems a bit of a stretch.

Yes.

Ever seen controlled opposition before?

But it's not really Christian, it seems more like VC is entertaining the Occult in an ironic or indirect way.

um basically 90% of the young generation which is currently who they are attempting to neuter and brainwash.

Pop stars are part of the establishments indoctrination of the younger generation so you should care. And the establishment definitely cares

Not what he says it's that he woke up so they modified him back into silence.  The music industry competes with CIA for being the most vile mind controllers. When their slaves start to wake they get re-educated. Torture is another word for that.

Nice link! From now on anyone who uses "FALSE MEMORY SYNDROME" shall be assumed to be a pedophile.

Interesting... That TMOR never made no sense to me.  Good thread.

Fair enough. Ive read up on the Montauk chair and also the creature they found that got washed up there. One thing I always think about when they name a particular installation as home to project "X" is partly a disinfo campaign just to throw people off the scent a bit. I wouldn't be surprised if the government conducted the alleged experiments, maybe just not at Montauk. I'm not familiar with project rainbow so it looks like a got some reading to do. 

Thanks, but I'm one of the lucky ones. Some never make it outta thier 20s, either drugs or suicide.

It may be controlled opposition, but there's still some really good info on the site. It was originally started by Mark Rockefeller but I don't know who runs it now.

Plum island is a bad place. They are responsible for the modern outbreak of Lyme's disease (note the island is very close to Lyme, CT). I'm fairly certain they fabricated the bacteria (or at least made it viable) there.

Well said. I wish you all the Best.

I'm sorry but could you point me in the right direction? Don't have the time to dig through your entire comment history, my bad

Bingo! Thank you. What are your thoughts on the super soldier cloning programs...like Max Spires and such?

Some of those clips are edited. Try sourcing the originals and you'll find that the pauses aren't as long as they are in this video.

Thank you for sharing. These are great.

Thanks, what a polite response:) Cheers

 

It's straight disinfo.

Yeah there are some good ones and others where they are reaching.  That Kourtney Kardashian one though...

Hey we're in r/conspiracy in an mkultra post talking about semantics. Pretty sure we're both nerds.

In the early 1950's, [Dr. Bernice Eddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernice_Eddy) and [Dr. Sarah Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Stewart_%28cancer_researcher%29) discovered [the polyoma virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomaviridae).As a result, the two were the first to successfully demonstrate that viruses causing cancer could be spread from animal to animal.Tragically, Dr. Eddy's warnings regarding tainted vaccines led to the infamous [Cutter Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernice_Eddy), which ultimately exposed several thousand children to the live polio virus:>In 1954, while the NIH was testing the first commercial polio vaccines, Eddy's job was to test the vaccines from five different companies. Testing the vaccines on 18 monkeys, she and her team discovered that the inactivated vaccine manufactured by Cutter Laboratories contained residual live poliovirus, resulting in the monkeys showing polio-like symptoms and paralysis. >Eddy reported her findings to William Workman, head of the Laboratory of Biologics Control, but her findings were never given to the vaccine licensing advisory committee. >Although then-NIH director William Sebrell was notified, he chose to ignore Eddy's findings and proceeded to license the Cutter vaccine along with the others. Dr. James Shannon, the associate director of the NIH, managed to get the vaccines recalled.Bernice Eddy also was the first to identify [SV-40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40), a cancer causing monkey virus that millions of people were exposed to through contaminated polio vaccines.From the Wikipedia page of [Dr. Herbert Ratner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Ratner):>In 1960 Ratner learned that a government researcher Dr. Bernice Eddy had discovered evidence of a cancer-causing agent that she described as a vacuolating virus in the Salk vaccine rhesus-monkey-kidney culture medium. >Dr. Ben Sweet working under Dr. Maurice Hilleman at Merck observed a similar agent in the same kind of medium that they were using to develop a vaccine for adenovirus. >The agent was later identified as a monkey virus and named Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Sweet & Hilleman published their work in November 1960 and Eddy published her work in May 1961. >The unused box of 1955 Salk polio vaccine Ratner had placed in his refrigerator remained there for more than forty years. In the meantime researchers had begun to discover that SV40 was associated with various cancers. One of these researchers was Dr. Michele Carbone, a molecular pathologist of Italian birth and education, then working at the University of Chicago.>Eventually the entire box of remaining vials was given to Carbone in the presence of a lawyer and witnesses. In these vials Carbone discovered two separate strains of SV40, one of which was a slow-growing strain previously not known to have been in polio vaccines and for which the vaccines currently being marketed were not being tested. >Moreover, this slow-growing strain was the same as one found in some types of cancerous tumors. Had Ratner not saved vials of vaccine, the source of this slow-growing strain would have been suspected but unproven.So Dr. Eddy not only made two huge discoveries (polyoma virus and SV-40), but she warned the scientific community *twice* about contamination of the polio vaccine and she was ignored twice![From the book The Health Century by Edward Shorter](http://www.whale.to/v/eddy.html):>Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy's discovery of the polyoma in 1957 marked the real takeoff of theories about virus and cancer. It could be destructive like polio, but produce tumors at the same time. >Although Stewart was later promoted within the cancer institute, she did not in her lifetime win the recognition she deserved. She died of cancer in 1976, Bernice Eddy remaining close to her until the end. "She was a forceful individual who did not let anything stand in the way if she could help it," said Eddy.>This is an interesting story, but in terms of drama it's nothing compared to what happens next. At the same time in the late 1950s that Eddy and Stewart were producing cancers in animals with the polyoma virus, Eddy had sneaked back to the polio vaccine. "I did things on the side which I wasn't assigned to do,"  Eddy said.  >One of them was starting to conduct safety experiments on the polio vaccine in June 1959, from which she had officially been removed four years earlier. In observing cells from the kidneys of rhesus monkeys under the microscope‚Äîthe kind of cell preparation from which the polio vaccine was being made by private drug companies‚ÄîEddy had noted spontaneous degeneration, meaning that the cells would start to die without any apparent cause. >She did more experiments with these cells, and on July 6, 1960, reported to her chief Joseph Smadel, that when she injected preparations from those monkey kidneys into hamsters, the hamsters got cancer. Tumors grew in newborn hamsters at the site of injection; probably a virus in the monkey cells was causing the cancer.>The story that follows is such a sad one, partly because Smadel himself was a distinguished scientist, not just a petty bureaucrat...he was not pleased, just after assuming his new post in viral research, when Eddy threw this time bomb onto his desk: the possibility of a cancer-causing virus in the polio vaccine. >In August he sat down with Eddy, went over her data, and dismissed the findings as "lumps." He thought her rumps unrelated to the degenerative changes (vacuolation) that other scientists had observed in the kidney cells of other monkey species, and he dismissed the possibility that the lumps, might be cancer or cause the disease in humans. >He must have been very nasty at the time, for he later wrote to Eddy,  "It is my recollection that I was not even diplomatic in telling you that you had no basis for either statement." This was not out of character for Smadel, who was generally known as brusque and authoritarian, although his earlier relations with Eddy while he had been at Walter Reed had been cordial.>The Eddy problem landed again on Smadel's desk when, in October of 1960, she gave a talk at the New York meeting of the Cancer Society. At the meeting she described finding a cancer-causing virus in the monkey cells from which the polio vaccine was grown. >Thomas Rivers of the March of Dimes Foundation was in the audience and later told Smadel what Eddy had said. Smadel hit the roof. "Smadel called me up," Eddy said, "and if there was anything in the English language‚Äîany awful name‚Äîthat he could call me, he did. Oh, he was mad. I never saw anybody so mad.‚Äù Smadel wrote Eddy a letter later that day forbidding her to speak in public again without clearing a written text of her remarks specifically with him. That was just the beginning.>Eventually, Bernice Eddy lost her labs. In successive measures she was denied permission to attend scholarly conferences, her papers were held up, and finally she was removed from vaccine research altogether. >Her treatment became a scandal within the scientific community and was discussed in Senate hearings.

The 1918 flu pandemic that killed millions [was partly caused by aspirin overdose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic#Aspirin_poisoning):>In a 2009 paper published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, Karen Starko proposed that aspirin poisoning had contributed substantially to the fatalities. >She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the post mortem reports still available, and also the timing of the big "death spike" in October 1918 which happened right after the Surgeon General of the United States Army, and the Journal of the American Medical Association both recommended very large doses of 8.0‚Äì31.2 g of aspirin per day. >Starko also suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a "perfect storm" of events: Bayer's patent on aspirin expired, so that many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the flu pandemic; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.

A weaponized form of Lyme Disease [was created and released](https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/10/02/the-politics-of-lyme-disease/) on Plum Island:>Plum Island is 10 miles from Old Lyme, Connecticut and a mile and a half off the North Fork of Long Island.>Michael Carroll, an attorney, formerly a law firm associate of the late New York Governor Mario Cuomo, notes in his book [Lab 257] that Lyme disease ‚Äúsuddenly surfaced in Old Lyme, Connecticut‚Äù in 1975 and cites years of experimentation before that with ticks on Plum Island and discusses the possibility of an accidental or purposeful release.>Lab 257 documents a Nazi connection to the original establishment by the U.S. Army of an animal disease laboratory on Plum Island. According to the book, Erich Traub, a scientist who worked for the Third Reich doing biological warfare, was the force behind its founding.>During World War II, ‚Äúas lab chief of Insel Riems‚Äîa secret Nazi biological warfare laboratory on a crescent-shaped island in the Baltic Sea¬≠‚ÄîTraub worked directly for Adolph Hitler‚Äôs second-in-charge, SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler, on live germ trials,‚Äù relates Lab 257. >The mission was to develop biological warfare to be directed against animals in the Soviet Union. This included infecting cattle and reindeer with foot-and-mouth disease. This became the mission, in a Cold War setting, at Plum Island.>And, states Lab 257, ‚ÄúThe tick is the perfect germ vector which is why it has long been fancied as a germ weapon by early biowarriors from Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan to the Soviet Union and the United States.‚Äù>‚ÄúA source who worked on Plum Island in the 1950s,‚Äù the book says, ‚Äúrecalls that animal handlers and a scientist released ticks outdoors on the island. ‚ÄòThey called him the Nazi scientist, when they came in, in 1951‚Äîthey were inoculating these ticks.‚Äù >Lab 257 goes on: ‚ÄúDr. Traub‚Äôs World War II handiwork consisted of aerial virus sprays developed on Insel Riems and tested over occupied Russia, and of field work for Heinrich Himmler in Turkey. Indeed, his colleagues conducted bug trials by dropping live beetles from planes. An outdoor tick trial would have been de rigueur for Erich Traub.‚Äù>Traub was brought to the U.S. with the end of the war under Project Paperclip, a program under which Nazi scientists, such as Wernher von Braun, came to America.>‚ÄúTraub‚Äôs detailed explanation of the secret operation on Insel Riems‚Äù given to officials at Fort Detrick in Maryland, the Army‚Äôs biological warfare headquarters, and to the CIA, ‚Äúlaid the groundwater for Fort Detrick‚Äôs offshore germ warfare animal disease lab on Plum Island.

1916 saw [one of the worst polio outbreaks](https://htmlimg3.scribdassets.com/8425i20p4w258wzf/images/9-7e65fb9cad.jpg) in US history. Originally blamed on "immigrants", a study determined that it was most likely caused by nearby Rockefeller Labs where a deadly "multi-virus" strain of polio was being developed.[More info about polio, including discussion of the 1916 outbreak](http://autismrawdata.net/1/post/2013/11/raw-data-polio.html):>However it is a remarkable coincidence that a unique neurotropic strain of poliovirus was developed a few miles from an epidemic caused by a uniquely pathogenic strain of the virus...such an extraordinary epidemic requires an extraordinary explanation.[Here's a very informative video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns) on the elusive history of "polio" and the polio vaccine, and [here's the slide show](http://www.scribd.com/doc/125897205/Polio-Dr-Suzanne-Humphries-clear-slides) Dr. Suzanne Humphries used in her presentation.

The [contaminated haemophilia blood products](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products) tragedy resulted in thousands of haemophiliacs infected with HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970's and 80's.Perhaps the most shocking thing about the episode was that the products *continued* to be sold [even when they were known to be contaminated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_VIII#Contamination_scandal):>Bayer sparked controversy by continuing to sell contaminated factor VIII after new heat-treated versions were available. Under FDA pressure, unheated product was pulled from US markets, but was sold to Asian, Latin American, and some European countries. The product was tainted with HIV, *a concern that had been discussed by Bayer and the FDA.*To me, you can't simply dismiss this as the actions of a greedy company...the intention must be far more nefarious, especially coming from a company like Bayer.

The story of [Judyth Vary Baker](http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKbakerJ.htm) is about as extraordinary as they come. It starts with a book by [Edward Haslam](http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKhaslamE.htm) called *Dr. Mary's Monkey: How the Unsolved Murder of a Doctor, a Secret Laboratory in New Orleans and Cancer-Causing Monkey Viruses are Linked to Lee Harvey Oswald, the JFK Assassination and Emerging Global Epidemics.*Haslam tells a riveting detective-like tale that spans numerous decades, resulting in the publishing of his first book on the subject, *Mary, Ferrie and the Monkey Virus*. After Judyth went public in 1999, Haslam rewrote the book (as he finally had the witness for his theories that he had been lacking) and released it as *Dr. Mary's Monkey*.Haslam focuses on the macabre and unsolved murder of prominent orthopedic surgeon and cancer researcher [Dr. Mary Stults Sherman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_S._Sherman). Sherman's body was discovered in 1964 in her apartment in New Orleans. However, the precise nature of her death wasn't released to the public for over 30 years. It was prematurely concluded that the killing was the work of a "sex-crazed lesbian" who conveniently was never found. Not surprisingly, it was never released to the public that Dr. Sherman's entire arm and right side were missing, exposing her insides. A superficial mattress fire in the apartment was blamed for her severe injuries, even though temperatures of thousands of degrees would be necessary to locally disintegrate flesh and bone while leaving the rest of her body intact. In addition, Dr. Sherman's heart and liver were stabbed, and the heart wound was inflicted while she was still alive. Curiously, her death occurred on the same morning that the Warren Commission first began taking witness testimony.Haslam argues that Dr. Sherman was engaged in a top secret project, ostensibly run by the well-known researcher and surgeon [Alton Ochsner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Ochsner), and included the young Judyth Baker, David Ferrie, and Lee Harvey Oswald.Dr. Ochsner, who was fiercely anti-Communist, had ties to the CIA, FBI, and even the Mafia, and was part of the very real effort at the time to remove Castro from power, by any means necessary.It's well known that elements of the CIA and Mafia were actively engaged in trying to kill Castro. Their main concern was that a violent death could ultimately be traced to US intelligent agencies, potentially resulting in World War III. Eventually, a more stealthy approach was attempted: perfect a cancer-causing bio-weapon to take out Castro. Although cancer-causing viruses had been discovered a decade earlier, the idea of "inducing" cancer in an individual was still considered by most to be in the realm of science fiction.Dr. Sherman was actively involved with this project, as well as the one of the most enigmatic figures in JFK assassination lore, [David Ferrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrie). Ferrie is perhaps most known today as being the first suspect of [Jim Garrison's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Garrison) infamous investigation into Kennedy's death.Amazingly, Garrison revealed in an interview with Playboy that he suspected David Ferrie and Dr. Sherman were somehow involved in a secret cancer project, however that little tidbit has largely been forgotten, and it seems even Garrison himself never realized the implications of this connection.In addition to being a defrocked priest and a pilot for the CIA and Carlos Marcello (the Mafia king of New Orleans), Ferrie just happened to be involved with Dr. Mary Sherman, one of the most prestigious female scientists in the country. Ferrie had allegedly developed an interest in cancer research. He filled his apartment with white mice--at one point he had almost 2000, and neighbors complained--and he wrote a medical treatise on the subject and worked with a number of New Orleans doctors on different means of inducing cancer in mice.He also lost all of his hair, and in light of his curious hobbies, this may have been the result of his dabbling with toxic chemicals. He was found dead only days after Garrison first accused him of being connected to the JFK assassination.Eventually the bio-weapon was more or less perfected, and it was subsequently successfully tested on (at least) one inmate at a nearby facility. The subject died in 28 days. However, it seems that their efforts were too little and too late, for the coalescence of interests that wanted to remove Castro from power had completely changed their directive and focused their sights on Kennedy instead. According to Baker, David Ferrie and Dr. Sherman were under the impression that they needed to hurry and created the weapon *before* their superiors got impatient and killed Kennedy instead.Lee Harvey Oswald was supposedly involved with this project, but more in the capacity of running errands and doing some of the dirty work, as he killed and dissected the cancerous tumors on the experimental mice on several occasions.Baker, although very young, had already established herself in the field of cancer research. While still in high school, she had induced cancer in mice faster than any public research being done at the time (one week). She attracted the attention of numerous prominent people, including Dr. Oschner, and she soon found herself being trained at the prestigious Roswell Park Memorial Institute in 1961.Baker and Oswald were hired on the same day at Standard Coffee, and then one week later they both were moved to Reilly. Their jobs at Reilly Coffee were covers for their actual activities. Baker, as the secretary, was responsible for clocking Oswald out to cover up his extended absences, and she still has numerous time cards for Lee with her initial "J" on the front.Anna Lewis, who was married to David Lewis, another well-known figure in JFK assassination lore, is perhaps the last living person who has gone on record saying she saw Judyth and Lee together and that they were lovers. Here is a video of [Anna Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyN37x3OfHs).As for when things went wrong, Baker claims that a letter she passionately wrote to Dr. Ochsner doomed her future career in the medical world. She had been extremely upset when she discovered that the "volunteer" the weapon was tested on wasn't a terminally ill inmate as she had been told, but a perfectly healthy young man. Unfortunately for Baker, the letter she wrote to Ochsner ended up in the hands of his secretary, violating the secrecy of the "Project". This infuriated Ochsner and he abruptly terminated his relationship with her.After the project unraveled, Oswald (an intelligence asset) began to suspect he was being set up as a patsy for Kennedy's death, but that he believed himself to be part of a team that was going to try and "prevent" the assassination in Dallas. According to Baker, Oswald stated that his presence in Dallas meant that one less bullet would be fired at Kennedy. She also claims to have met Jack Ruby, who was introduced to her as "Sparky Rubinstein" and she was unaware until decades later that Sparky was the one who killed Oswald. Ruby and Oswald had apparently been friends for years. Oswald's mother had dated numerous Mafia men, including Carlos Marcello's personal driver, so Oswald had ties to the Mafia from a young age. She was also adamant that her son was a government agent and was framed for Kennedy's death.It's even been alleged that Ruby himself called the police station where Oswald would be killed and warned them that an attempt would be made on his life.Ruby's fate, however, was anything but merciful, as he died of cancer shortly after his incarceration. To make matters even more bizarre, Ruby actually claimed to have been injected with cancer while in prison! This was during a time when such a notion was considered ludicrous by the general population, but it fits rather ominously into the narrative of Haslam and Baker.It's possible that Ruby knew of Dr. Sherman's project, and he may have been aware of exactly *how* they induced the cancer: the subject would be submitted to high doses of radiation with an X-ray machine to compromise the immune system, followed by a series of painful shots.Ruby received this X-ray treatment in jail and then was given several shots from a mysterious doctor. When Ruby's cancer was examined after his death, it was observed to be an extremely aggressive form of lung cancer.Dr. Sherman herself likely fell victim to this conspiracy, as Haslam suggests that the secret linear particle accelerator in New Orleans that they were using to irradiate cancer cells was responsible for her extreme injuries. Something clearly went wrong while operating the machine, and she was hastily stabbed, while still alive, and her body moved to her apartment in a sloppy attempt to create a "murder" scene.For more information on Judyth Baker and her story, she is featured in part 8 of the excellent series [The Men Who Killed Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Killed_Kennedy).60 Minutes was once set to release a special on Baker, but an order was given to immediately stop production on the segment and it was never completed. According to Haslam, the frustrated 60 Minutes team told him that they had spent more time and money on the story than any in the history of the program.

Sugar industry paid off scientists to downplay the dangers of sugar and vilified fat as the culprit and we all ended up obese with type II and heart disease. https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

As both a biomedical and public health researcher, I have often tried to find a universal connection behind the prevalence of chronic disease and the health of our mitochondria seems to be the answer.The mitochondria are bacteria that live inside most of our cells and supply most of the energy currency, ATP, through a near motor-like system called Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS) along the Electron Transport Chain. Healthy mitochondria elongate, and the surface area of the cristae, folds wherein OXPHOS occurs, increases, promoting more energy potential per mitochondria unit. Similar to cells, mitochondria can divide, move, and former networks in strategic locations near structures that require large amounts of energy.Furthermore, mitochondria are inherited from mothers. Giving a direct genetic line where metabolic disease, disorders, and energetic inefficiency can be inherited. Many pollutants, carcinogens, inflammatory agents, drugs, foods, and more, promote the production of Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) and other DAMPs (damage associated molecular pathogens) which can easily cause structural damage to the mitochondria or mitochondrial DNA (it is more susceptible than nuclear DNA because bacteria have limited protection). As these agents increasingly affect a person, the ratio of healthy to unhealthy mitochondria can change, promoting disease states. Furthermore, the mitochondria in your eyes and brain can be completely different than those in your leg muscles or heart, a state called heteroplasmy (nuclear DNA is homoplasmy, same in all cells). Returning to the maternal inheritance: a proposed theory of maternal inheritance is the "mitochondrial bottleneck" wherein RANDOM mitochondria are transferred from mother to egg. So it's a chance game on what mitochondria will transfer to child, however if 50% of your mitochondria are healthy and 50% diseased, the chances of child inheriting disease is more likely.We have all heard of the "beer belly" or the person who just exercises their biceps and triceps but not their calves. What this phenotype comes down to is as the person exercises or drinks the mitochondrial energetic potential in these regions change so the person can support the mechanics of these structures. In the beer belly case though, the mitochondria in the gut organs become diseased and produce scant amounts of energy and cant process the rush of carbohydrates hitting the system, promoting fat deposition. A similar story occurs in the development of Diabetes Type II where the Beta-cells which produce insulin according to blood sugar eventually are overworked, desensitized and eventually chronically inflamed resulting in pancreatitis. The mitochondria in these regions are ravaged and beaten and end up contributing to the destruction of the region. Mitochondria additionally control the on and off switch for apoptosis (cell death) and can be implicated in cancers (immortal cells, the on/off switch is gone!)The connection between mitochondrial health and these modern diseases following the 1950s is infallible. However, indirectly, synthetic ways of life, the capitalistic societies we live in, and disregard for community health promote environments where mitochondrial damage is inevitable. The real conspiracy I am attempting to illuminate is the disregard for viewing ENERGY as source of disease rather than just MATTER. I consider this as logical, given life in a materialistic society, focused on body parts or organs being diseased, however these organs would not exist without ENERGY.

[Hilary Koprowski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Koprowski) invented the first "effective" live polio vaccine, and used monkey and chimpanzee parts to make them.[Albert Sabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Sabin), the other main producer of the polio vaccine at the time, analyzed Koprowski's "oral" vaccine and found that it was "unstable and contaminated by an unknown virus." In response, Koprowski claimed that Sabin was trying to discredit his work.As it happens, Sabin was also manufacturing a contaminated polio vaccine with a *different* lethal virus: [SV40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40).According to the [oral polio vaccine AIDS hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis):>From 1957 to 1960, after years of tinkering with monkey kidneys and polio germs, Dr. Hilary Koprowski tested his own experimental polio vaccine on 325,000 equatorial Africans, including 75,000 citizens of Leopoldville, Belgian Congo.>98% of the vaccine recipients were infants and toddlers. The youngest children received 15 times the adult dosage. Though Koprowski claimed he had the backing of the World Health Organization, WHO denied sanctioning the large-scale trials.>In 1959, Dr. Albert Sabin reported in the British Medical Journal that Koprowski's polio vaccine used in the African trials contained an "unidentified" cell-killing virus. It was never identified. >However, in 1986 the earliest known blood sample containing antibodies against HIV was traced back to 1959. The serum came from a patient visiting a clinic in Leopoldville.>Koprowski's vaccine was not approved for human use, so it was discontinued in 1960 following the African trials. Thus, it was only administered to inhabitants of the Belgian Congo, Rwanda and Burundi--the precise area where high levels of HIV infection were identified by researched 30 years later. >Furthermore, the AIDS virus is known to infect mucous cells, prevalent in the mouth. The African vaccines were squirted into people's mouths.

The CDC is a revolving door that has blurred the lines between Big Pharma and Big Government.In 2004, [CDC scientist William Thompson expressed his concerns](https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/breaking-cdc-vaccine-whistleblower-given-immunity-to-testify/) that the agency was engaged in a coverup of the connection between the MMR vaccine and autism.Thompson attempted to notify his superior at the time, [Julie Gerberding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Gerberding):>In 2004, whistleblower Thompson [wrote her a letter](https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/09/10/cdc-whistleblower-this-is-the-real-smoking-gun/), in which he warned her that he had sensitive and troubling data about the MMR vaccine‚Äôs connection to autism. He was shortly due to present the data at a major vaccine/autism conference.>Apparently, Gerberding didn‚Äôt answer the letter, and Thompson‚Äôs presentation was canceled.>After Gerberding left the CDC in 2009, she ascended to the position of president of Merck Vaccines. Merck manufactures the MMR vaccine.>Interestingly, in December of 2014, Merck removed Gerberding from her august position and placed her in a new role, a role that never existed within the company before: executive vice-president for ‚Äústrategic communications, global public policy and population health.‚Äù>Did Merck make this move to shield Gerberding, to protect her from a possible scandal tying her to the 2004 MMR-autism fraud at the CDC? If there is a Congressional hearing, will Gerberding be conveniently unavailable because she is overseas tending to her new international duties at Merck?The flu vaccine is [another major cash cow](https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/09/05/cdc-caught-in-billion-dollar-scheme-to-to-sell-vaccines/) for the CDC:>The CDC employs straight PR lies [when it counts the number of flu deaths every year](https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/welcome-to-the-medical-matrix-the-flu-isnt-the-flu/) in the US.For example, Peter Doshi wrote a particularly damning analysis for the journal BMJ Online (December 2005), stating:>‚Äú[According to CDC statistics], ‚Äòinfluenza and pneumonia‚Äô took 62,034 lives in 2001‚Äî61,777 of which were attributable to pneumonia and 257 to flu, and in only 18 cases was the flu virus positively identified.‚ÄùThe CDC created one category that combines both flu and pneumonia deaths, assuming that the pneumonia deaths are complications stemming from the flu.>This is an absurd assumption. Pneumonia has a number of causes. But even worse, in all the 2001 flu and pneumonia deaths, only 18 revealed the presence of an influenza virus. Therefore, the CDC couldn‚Äôt truthfully say that more than 18 people died of influenza in 2001. Not 36,000 deaths, the usual PR statistic. 18 deaths.Doshi continued his assessment of published CDC flu-death statistics: >Between 1979 and 2001, [CDC] data show an average of 1348 [flu] deaths per year (range 257 to 3006).‚Äù These figures refer to flu separated out from pneumonia.This death toll is obviously far lower than the parroted 36,000 figure. But it would drop much lower, if you added the need to confirm the presence of a flu virus in those cases.The CDC is a PR agency.

 that in the US, the CDC had dropped the OPV from its vaccine schedule [*because it was causing polio.*](http://www.thinktwice.com/Polio.pdf)According to Neetu Vashisht and Jacob Puliyel at St. Stephens Hospital in Delhi:>The charade about polio eradication and the great savings it will bring has persisted to date. It is a paradox that while the director general of WHO and Bill Gates are trying to muster support for polio eradication it has been known to the scientific community, for over 10 years, that eradication of polio is impossible.>This is because in 2002 scientists had synthesized a chemical called poliovirus in a test-tube with the empirical formula C332,652H492,388N98,245O131,196P7, 501S2,340. It has been demonstrated that by positioning the atoms in sequence, a particle can emerge with all the properties required for its proliferation and survival in nature.Vashisht and Puliyel [published their findings](http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/index.php/ijme/article/view/110/1065) in the *Indian Journal of Medical Ethics* and [‚Äúshould have made headlines around the globe.‚Äù](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/08/28/polio-eradication-campaign.aspx) They determined:>‚Ä¶while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. >Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere [First, do no harm] was violated.For more info on the history of the polio, smallpox and other vaccines, [here's a lengthy post on the topic of vaccines](https://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/23og48/the_skeptics_guide_to_vaccines_part_i_poxes_polio/).

The ultimate medical conspiracy is the historical fact that it has, for thousands of years,  increased death rates while reducing birth rates and lifespan.  For Pre 20th century medicine our modern official consensus recognizes this.   Modern medicine likes to take credit for the population explosion of the last century but in reality the cause of this is that bloodletting and completely excessive doses of poisons fell out of Vogue as the immediate response to every ailment..   Or in other words medicine was made slightly less lethal.

Everybody knows this by now, Cannabis was recognized as medicine by experts in the 1880's.From Dr. Beard (1889):>**HEADACHE**: I have myself  been a frequent sufferer from this disease, and have experimented thoroughly on myself and on others with nearly all of the well-known remedies and systems of treatment. My conclusion is, that sick headache is much more relievable and curable than is commonly supposed.Almost all cases can be relieved in less than ten hours, sometimesin half an hour. The disease is a very common one. It visits nearly every household.It is, moreover, a disease that patients are usually obliged to treat themselves.The plan of treatment which I propose, and which I usuallyfind more or less successful, is as follows:1. Begin treatment early, before the disease is at its height.This rule is as important in the treatment of sick headache as inthe treatment of a common cold. (See Common Cold.) Commencetreatment as soon as you suspect that an attack is coming on.Some persons can foretell when they are to have an attack forseveral hours in advance; others have very little warning.2. Take 1 or 2 grains (.06 or .12 gram) of citrate of caffeinedry on the tongue. Repeat the dose in half an hour if there is norelief. Some can bear 3 or 4 grains (.18 or .24 gram) at a dose.Begin with moderate doses. This is a wonderful remedy for sick headache. I have calledthe attention of many physicians to this, and their results confirmmine. Caffeine is easy to take, is not unpleasant, is not dangerousin moderate doses. It is the active principle common to coffee,tea, chocolate, and guarana. It acts in some cases, when just theproper dose is taken, with magical power. The only objectionto its use is that it keeps one awake if taken late in the evening.One can take it and go right on about the routine of business.Take a pill of cannabis indica (Indian hemp), ¬Ω or 1/3 of a grain(.03 or .02 gram). Repeat in half an hour if necessary, or doublethe dose.This remedy sometimes succeeds when caffeine fails, or whencaffeine has worn out its virtue by long use.3. The following pill :      Extract of cannabis indica, ¬Ω  drachm (2 grams),      " "guarana, 1 ¬Ω   scruple (1.87 gram),     Citrate of caffeine, 1 drachm (4 grams),Mix, and make into sixty pills.DOSE. -Take one pill and repeat the dose in one hour if necessary.TL:DR I present this as evidence of medical corruption coming from outside the community of Doctors; their recommendations sidelined by conspiratorial agenda. While I know this is mainstream now, it remains clear evidence that severe Medical Conspiracy occurred, and thus, probably *is occurring*.

 

[HIV = AIDS Deconstructing The Myth Of AIDS ](https://youtu.be/euXpgfMeP-U)AIDS research has failed because it has never really found the cause.Over **100,000** research papers published on HIV/AIDS and there was no direct proof that HIV causes AIDS.  It took less money and scientific talent to land on the moon.  We have spent over 40 Billion (1995, time of this movie) dollars already.What exactly is killing the T-Cells that allow opportunistic infections in?Who was first to say it was even a retrovirus?  Dr. Robert Gallo.  He failed to prove retroviruses caused cancer in his previous decades work.  Also he had NOT submitted his test results (for HIV/AIDS) for peer review before an important conference telling the world that it was HIV that causes AIDS.  Added to that, The Institute Pasteur in Paris claimed that Gallo's "AIDS" Virus was actually their discovery (LAV) they sent him 6 months prior to a conference in 1984.  Dr. Luc Montagnier (who discovered HIV) has even stated "HIV might be benign."April 23 1984;The press conference that invented the aids virus.  It was also stated they would have a cure within two (1986) years.  As the Press conference was going on... ...the blood test used to detect HIV was being patented, which would earn large royalties for Gallo and his ilk.The previously mentioned test results were then published a week after this conference in Science magazine.  When it was more thoroughly examined, "Only 44 of 93 AIDS patients tested had the virus (HIV) ~ less than half"  Yet, Gallo claims in "further studies he could find HIV in 90% of AIDS patients tested."  Dr. Peter Duesberg Ph D of Berkley (considered by some, the foremost retrovirus analyzer - first to map genomes of virus' etc) in 1987 put out a review claiming HIV is not causing AIDS.  He also claimed HIV is an old harmless virus that has been in humans for centuries.  Nobel Prize winners Dr. Walter Gilbert and Dr. Kary Mullis also question the validity of HIV = AIDS.Several of these men and women formed The Group for Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis.  The letter they sent was rejected by Nature Magazine, the New England Journal, JAMA and The Lancet.  It was only four sentances long.>"It is widely believed by the general public that a retrovirus called HIV causes a group of diseases called AIDS.  Many bio-medical scientists now question this hypothesis.  We propose a thorough reappraisal of the existing evidence for and against this hypothesis be conducted by a suitable independent group.  We further propose that critical epidemiological studies by devised and undertaken."  The Group for Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS HypothesisAfter it was rejected, the Group obtained more than the ten to 12 original signatures - it jumped to 30, than 50, 100, and than 600 (188 of which had advanced degrees).  They have a website and newsletter of their own, but this Group is ignored by the media and publishers of mainstream magazines.10 Scientific reason why HIV does not cause AIDS;**1**) HIV (*like any other viruses*) is harmless after antibody immunity.  The HIV test searches for the antibodies that are produced to subdue HIV.  When a person tests positive to HIV they are immune to the Virus at this point.  "There is no known diseases that ever reemerge to cause the illness after the antibodies have done their job."**2**) HIV does not kill the T-Cells it infects.  HIV researchers use T-Cells to grow the Virus because T-Cells live compatibly with HIV.  Retroviruses (unlike animal and other known viruses) do not kill cells, ever.**3**) HIV does not infect enough T-Cells to cause AIDS.  HIV only infects 1 out of 1,000 T-Cells (and sometimes 1 out of 100,000).  T-Cells can reproduce at the rate of 5% per day.  HIV cannot infect enough T-Cells to completely shift the balance.  Simple math~ **4**) HIV has no AIDS causing gene.  HIV has no unique reason to cause AIDS.  All retroviruses have only three major genes; GAG, ENV and POL and only six minor genes.  50-100 different retroviruses infect every healthy human body.  All are kept under control by the antibodies.  "HIV behaves no differently than other retroviruses."**5*) There is no such thing as a slow virus.  HIV is said to take 10-12 years after infection to cause AIDS.  This would give HIV "magical abilities" such as; Reactivating, Mutating, Migrating and Hibernating.  A retrovirus has effects within days, or weeks (at the most 3 weeks) - all of them, including HIV.  It is impossible for HIV to take 10-12 years to activate and cause AIDS.**6**) HIV is not a new virus, so it could not cause a "new" epidemic.  Aids cases have increased from 0 (1980) to half a million (1996).  It must be a new infection to cause the recent AIDS epidemic.  Essential Logic: How old is HIV? and where does it come from?  HIV is old (older than America)  and should not create an epidemic now.  HIV has been passed down through every generation for centuries without causing AIDS.**7**) HIV fails Kock's Postulates...which "are four criteria designed to establish a causal relationship between a causative microbe (HIV) and a disease (AIDS)."  The organism must;     1. ...be Found in all Cases of the Disease.10-20% of AIDS patients have no HIV at all.Only tiny amounts of the dormant virus are found.     2. ...be Isolated from the Host and Grown in Pure Culture.     3. ...Cause the Same Disease when injected into a new healthy host.Health care workers accidently infected rarely get AIDS unless they use recreational drugs and AZT (their cure...).     4. ...Must be Found Growing Again in the Newly-Diseased Host.**8**) AIDS has remained in it's original risk groups for over 12 years... when an epidemic strikes it affects small groups and then multiplies to the rest.  If a disease does not spread...it must be caused by something non-infectious.  AIDS Risk groups:   Homosexual Males  62%   IV Drug Users        32%   Hemophiliacs            1%   Transfusion Patients 2%       Total                  97%If AIDS is truly caused by a Virus...AIDS patients not in the Risk Groups above should be growing above the remaining 3%.  AIDS has failed to spread to the female population also.  HIV Tests on US Army recruits from 1985-1996 show a spread of 50/50.  Yet 9 out of 10 who develop AIDS is Male.  More than half of the woman (and 80% of males) with AIDS use IV Drugs.  AIDS seems to be more related to behaviour and certain medical risks than it is to HIV infection.**9**) The international profile of AIDS patients is inconsistent.  Germ-related diseases affect the same demographics world-wide.  This is not the case when American and African results were concluded;America: 90% Male 10% Female (97% in Risk Groups)Africa: 50% Male 50% Female (No Risk Groups)AIDS hits harder in industrialized nations (America and Europe) because it is believed that more IV Drug use is rampant.  Dr. Duesberg even believes that the AIDS strain in Africa is a different one than in America.  "Different as day and night."Philippe Krynem (French Humanitarian) posted in the London Sunday Times (October 3, 1993) "There is no AIDS, it is something that has been invented."  After spending time in the so-called "epicenter" of the AIDS epidemic in Africa.**10**) AIDS occurs without HIV infection.  Most people with HIV never develop AIDS.  "The evidence in support of HIV is based *solely* on correlation."  Correlation does not prove causation.  If HIV is a harmless passenger Virus we should see: "People with AIDS not infected with HIV" and "People with HIV who are healthy and do not get AIDS."  That is exactly what is happening.  There are 4,621 (in 1993) documented cases where patients with AIDS do not have HIV.

I once heard that blood is big business. We donate it for free, but insurance companies pay out the ass for it when people need transfusions, so someone is making a lot of money on free blood.

The patent system is bogus but generates high profits for the pharmaceutic industries and ensures over-priced medicine for consumers. Economists know that the patent system does not work at all, is not beneficial for the economy or based on sound economics.The 1958 Machlup report investigated the system and found it to be bogus, in its conclusions suggested to keep the system anyway and "muddle through".https://mises.org/sites/default/files/An%20Economic%20Review%20of%20the%20Patent%20System_Vol_3_3.pdf

Has anyone here had experiences with depression meds and anti-depressant apathy disorder? (I think that is what it‚Äôs called but it has been a while since I‚Äôve looked it up.) I personally believe that I suffered from this but I haven‚Äôt found too much info on it. I‚Äôm not really sure what I believe as far as a conspiracy goes with this, and while I do think that some people do need antidepressants and benefit from them, I find it sketchy that so many people report having to go through cycles of their meds not working anymore and then having to start on something else. It almost looks like an endless, hopeless cycle of meds that someone is making a lot of money off of.

There's no argument that medical marijuana has been held down. Things are finally changing.

DCA (dichloroacetate) has been used to treat Mitochondrial disorders in children since the 70's. Recently they discovered that it has been shown to cure all types of cancer in animal studies. The FDA has stonewalled further clinical trials in the US and it is being pursued in Canada currently. http://medicorcancer.com/dca-dichloroacetate-frequently-asked-questions/

I used to work for the chemistry department at a state university. Our contract was with the military and developing vaccines for the Saudis. For safety, I will not divulge names. You can't imagine the types of fuck-ups that happen with deadly viruses. At one point the freezer went down for a week, for months a senior thesis student mixed supposed antibiotics where no concentration was present. What is even scarier is that for any vaccine to be considered vialable for consumers, it only has to be effective for 51% of the population. The other 49% could be live, carcinogenic, or purposefully have alternate substances, and pass federal or international regulation. This is the scientific amd medical standard for vaccines. Most normal vaccines babies receive are so automated that this isn't much of an issue, but everything else is a shot in the dark, if not intentionally neglectful or harmful to the masses. I learned this from inernational biochemists who fabricate the vaccines. It is one of the major factors of why I dropped out of physical science altogether, don't blindly trust a doctor, they are only there to take your money.

Wow. I never knew this. 

Just to add the story that links this virus research to the CIA, Cold War Cuba and the JFK assassination. Dr Mary's Monkey.

As a side note they learned in the 30s that foreign nervous system tissue (mouse and rabbit brains were two examples) when injected tended to provoke an auto immune response to one's own nervous system.  Vaccines and the reactions they caused were the birth of  studying anaplaxis and allergy... So when Salk was grinding up monkey spinal cords for injection into America's youth it was well understood that severe nervous system damage would be a real consequence.Additionally, it is important to state that during the epidemic of polio injections were just coming into Vogue and it was a dirty technology.   Research the connection between serum sickness and paralysis.. A secondary paralyzing agent prevalent in society were organochlorine nerve agents.. Aka insecticides such as DDT.   A public health camping promoted the widespread use of these poisons (including aerial spraying of cities and painting it on common surfaces )during the polio epidemic,  and several wound up being banned in the 60s due to health effects.

I am floored....this post should be published. I want to print this up and drop off in doctor waiting rooms so patients could at least have a fair chance at informed consent. My question is do doctors know about this scandal? Is the oncology community aware of the connection between vaccines and cancer? This is huge, thank you for sharing this topic!! Mainstream Media has been criminally negligent for not exposing this. Thank you Reddit conspiracy. The truth truly sets the blind free.

Dude my cousin grew up in Old Lyme and got a horrible case of Lyme disease as a child that took him years to overcome. He had to have skin grafts on his arm it got so bad, he still wears a sleeve over the arm today. This was in the 90's. I wonder if it's related?

Best friend got lymes in her early 20s and now 9 years later basically has lymes disease induced psychosis. She is a shell of her former self, wanders around aimlessly, fits of rage and laughter, can't connect thoughts or hold a conversation. Very sad.

Is there any way to reverse mitochondrial damage? I'm someone that has suffered from a chronic health condition that's associated with mitochondrial dysfunction - I know that recovery from this disease is possible, but I'm curious about whether mitochondrial damage is permanent. 

No biomedical researcher would call mitochondria "bacteria that live inside most of our cells" 

Most of what you're saying is true but blaming your beer belly on local mitochondria is just plain stupid. I'm a kinesiology undergrad and I know that no mitochondria are static in the way you're proposing. Having a beer belly can be much more easily explained by the hormonal factors associated with gender and motor neuron recruitment and patterns. More fat utilization in one area=more storage in that area.

> The real conspiracy I am attempting to illuminate is the disregard for viewing ENERGY as source of disease rather than just MATTER. I consider this as logical, given life in a materialistic society, focused on body parts or organs being diseased, however these organs would not exist without ENERGY.I had/received this insight during an ayahuasca ceremony, but this paints it in a more scientific light. Fascinating. Can you share more of your thoughts & findings on this?

Just going to tag onto this post that there are a bunch of medical drugs that we use all the time are known to be toxic to mitochondria.  If you understand where mitochondria come from, one of the biggest classes should be obvious: [antibiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760005/), especially bacteriocidal antibiotics.But don't just blame doctors: alcohol will fuck a mito up, too.Take care of yourselves.

I am exposed to way more infectious diseases on a regular basis than the flu, yet have never caught any of them or spread them to someone I know. 3.) the flu vaccine can cause guillain burre syndrome which paralyzes your entire body, I've had about a dozen patients in the past few years with this disease, a few of which were confirmed to be from the vaccine4.) the flu shot isn't even effective statistically, and one year was only 6% effectiveI am totally for vaccinating against deadly or debilitating diseases, but the flu is not one of them. It pisses me off the more I think about it 

[Pharmageddon](https://www.amazon.com/Pharmageddon-David-Healy/dp/0520275764) covers enough of this to make you want to never take a prescription again.

This shit makes my blood boil, who the fuck do they think they are? Sickening. 

The Volants are different tho. I saw this in another thread. One was Volant LLC and one was Volant, Inc or some shit. One is a defense company and one is unknown

The 47500 cases of polio link doesn't work anymore, and it was removed from the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics (my usual link for showing people http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/202co114.html) after the Ivory Tower applied pressure.The way back machine has it stored though: http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/articles/polio-programme-let-us-declare-victory-and-move-on/?galley=html>while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Also, this info is great: http://www.thinktwice.com/Polio.pdf>‚Äú**In 1976, Dr. Jonas Salk, creator of the killed-virus vaccine used in the 1950s, testified that the live-virus vaccine (used almost exclusively in the U.S. from the early 1960s to 2000) was the ‚Äòprincipal if not sole cause‚Äô of all reported polio cases in the U.S. since 1961** [44]. (The virus remains in the throat for one to two weeks and in the feces for up to two months. Thus, vaccine recipients are at risk, and can potentially spread the disease, as long as fecal excretion of the virus continues [45].) In 1992, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published an admission that the live-virus vaccine had become the dominant cause of polio in the United States [36]. In fact, **according to CDC figures, every case of polio in the U.S. since 1979 was caused by the oral polio vaccine** [36]. Authorities claim the vaccine was responsible for about eight cases of polio every year [46]. However, an independent study that analyzed the government‚Äôs own vaccine database during a recent period of less than five years uncovered 13,641 reports of adverse events following use of the oral polio vaccine. These reports included 6,364 emergency room visits and 540 deaths (Figure 3) [47,48]. Public outrage at these tragedies became the impetus for removing the oral polio vaccine from immunization schedules [36:568;37;38].‚Äù http://www.4thmedia.org/2013/05/bill-and-melinda-gates-polio-vaccine-caused-47500-cases-of-paralysis-and-death/

Wtf.... Opv is still used here in here.And has always had a large government PR team behind it

Whenever someone gets angry about homeopathy, I like to remind them that when medical treatment is *worse* than a placebo, take the fucking placebo.It never fails to piss them off even more.

Death By Medicine documentary: https://youtu.be/RwCUDCQMLwYPhenomenal facts showing that modern medicine is the greatest cause of death.  ER situations are great, but most all else is garbage that causes more harm than good.

Around the same time (1895), Bayer were marketing diacetylmorphine as Heroin for use as a cough suppressant, and claimed it to be a "non-addictive morphine substitute". For obvious reasons, Heroin is no longer used as an anti-tussive.I do believe that cannabis likely has wide range of medical applications (particularly for pain relief), and more research should be done and made available, but I don't think a recommendation from 1889 is particularly strong evidence (at least on its own).

Ceramine. Your welcome.Works through CB1 receptor. 

I have seen a shocking amount of service members (myself included) develop autoimmune diseases, with the large majority being Crohn's / UC cases.  Hell, at my particular squadron,  we had four new ulcerative colitis cases in the span of six months, a few (unsure of the number) instances of psoriasis, and one case of arthritis.  It is fucking insane.  This was all less than a decade ago, btw.  

Autoimmune disease is caused in part by over-sanitation and less exposure to foreign biological microorganisms  

The CDC Definition of AIDS:Kaposi Sarcoma + HIV = AIDSKaposi Sarcoma - HIV = Kaposi SarcomaPneumonia + HIV = AIDSPneumonia - HIV = PneumoniaDementia + HIV = AIDSDementia - HIV = DementiaThis is their definition.  If you have HIV with a certain disease, you have AIDS, if HIV is not present - it's the fault of the original disease.  There is no HIV specific disease anywhere.  Such a joke.  This definition of AIDS "creates a near 100% correlation between the virus and AIDS."  "This 'correlation' is not objective, or scientific and is *deceptively self-fulfilling*."~ as of 1993Estimate of Total HIV infected: 28,000,000? Total of **Officially** reported AIDS cases 1,393,649 (5%)HIV Infected without AIDS: 95%*Estimated *Total Aids cased: 7,700,000???Only 3% of Africans have AIDS with HIV.  The other 97% are healthy and without AIDS (even though they have HIV).Some other claims by Dr. Peter Duesberg; "Aids is not infectious," "Not being spread sexually," "Not a threat to the public at large."The hypothesis is that "AIDS is caused by recreational drug use and chemotherapy treatments (AZT)."  "IV Drugs are the cause of AIDS in 9 out of 10 cases."  At this point (53min'sh) Duesberg shows a chart displaying the dramatic rise of AIDS cases per year compared to HIV.  HIV is a flat line (for 10 years), unchanging.  Figure it out.  He then shows Cocaine and Heroine use applied to his chart, and the rise mirrors that of AIDS cases.  But once again, correlation =! causation.  Atleast in his examples, the facts are based on reason and science.  He makes his case at 54 minutes very well.Nitrates used by homosexual men (poppers) as aphrodesiacs is extremely immuno-suppresant.  Rectum tissue is also 1 layer thick (compared to the vagina's 3 layers) which allows for more for foreign protein transfers.  These foreign proteins have also been proven to be immuno-suppresant.  Also it is known that large amounts of Anti-biotics were/are used by homosexuals which, are as well, immuno-sppresent."You can take any group of homosexual or heterosexual men, HIV positive, but not using poppers, cocaine, heroin, or AZT and they will never get AIDS (Aka sarcoma, turbocuelosis + HIV etc)." ~ says Duesberg.  During the AIDS scare AZT is passed in 1987 for use in killing HIV, even though previously it was "too poisonous for cancer treatment."  It was tested on animals and deemed "too toxic for use in human beings."  AZT is a DNA Chain Terminator, highly mutagenic and randomly targets bone marrow (where Lumphocyte Immune Cells are being made...the very cells needed most by AIDS patients), Kidneys, Liver, Intestines, Muscle Tissue, the Brain and the Central Nervous System.  "AZT causes AIDS defining diseases.  It was designed to kill human cells."Check out the rest from around ~1:05:00 on.  It get's even more interesting in the last hour with testimonies, personal accounts and conclusions/implications.

Very interesting and sounds like it could be true... Except for the part about no diseases ever reemerging to cause illness after the initial immune reaction. What about herpes outbreaks and HPV outbreaks that occur in people who have carried the viruses for years, sometimes they have no symptoms, sometimes they have outbreaks.

Have you seen the 1998 documentary *Gulf War Syndrome, a Deadly Legacy*? https://youtu.be/T_KtT_0MJJU It has amazing insights on the experimental vaccines used on army personnel.  It discusses how the suits they were given had vulnerabilities that let in toxins. 

Wait... I thought I was woke,  but I didn't know *this*.

Did you even listen to the video you linked? What evidence does this person provide? None is the answer. He compares our lives to 1984. Wow, great, awesome. Totally factual.

We do live a little longer. About 10 years. But yeah people assume everyone died in their 30's hundreds of years ago. Really if you were a male you'd probably make it to your mid 60's. If you were a female your big risk of dying was childbirth, if you survived that you'd also live till the same age. These days we live until our 70's. Of course the reduction in infant mortality is a huge benefit too.

I just buried someone in a small town cemetery while I was there I couldn't help but notice that most the dead people there died between the age of 24-48 this age group made up more than half the cemetery the old people buried there were 50-66 which made up most of the rest with very very few older than 70

Just learned about this one in school. Medical errors are absolutely terrifying, but we really are doing everything we can to prevent them and change the system to help prevent them too. These errors are made by the actual healthcare providers and not big corporations, so it is something that will be fixed, as those who provide healthcare USUALLY actually care about the patients and their well being. 

Actually, it's the number one cause (and that still doesn't count several high numbers from other factors): https://youtu.be/RwCUDCQMLwY

;)

Health is perhaps the most important topic to discuss.  I may have started my journey through Mythology and Cosmology, but it seems that all truth seekers end up going down the Health rabbit-hole at some point.  It's important for every type of person and in the end, being healthy and preventing disease with proper diet, exercise, spirituality, de-stressing/being happy, enough sleep and having purpose are key to being an efficient and authentic human being.

Multiple comments have been about vaccines ITT so far...

Ages 10-34 for Males, suicide is the number two cause of death: https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/lcod/men/2014/all-males/index.htmIt's absurd.  I am of the belief that many of these suicides are caused from side effects from pharmaceuticals. "Suicidal ideation" is among the side effects.  

[I included a detailed write up of this story ITT](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74axem/rconspiracy_round_table_6_medical_conspiracies/dnxklvb/).

For those unfamiliar with this topic, he's referring to [Royal Rife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rife) who invented an extremely powerful microscope in the 1930's and claimed to be able to use frequency to "weaken or destroy pathogens by energetically exciting destructive resonances in their constituent chemicals."Unfortunately for Rife, the scientific establishment in the 1940's and 50's was even more entrenched and close-minded than even today:>Rife blamed the scientific rejection of his claims on a conspiracy involving the American Medical Association (AMA), the Department of Public Health, and other elements of "organized medicine", which had "brainwashed and intimidated" his colleagues.

I was a biomedical equipment tech 15 years ago. I kept up with some of the new equipment manufacturers were trying to patent. Bayer was trying to make a machine that vibrated organs to a specific frequency that was their natural "healthy" frequency. In essence, a rife machine. It never came out.

Paul Joseph Watson discussing depression with kickboxing world champion Andrew Tate: https://youtu.be/Wvvz4h_ZgdIIt is my belief that many people go through tragic events and must go through the process of grief and healing.  Speaking from experience, you never really fully heal but there are comforts in (at least in my world view) knowing that there is more than this material plane.  They are always with you, this I know.What the medical establishment tries to do is become a middle-man of grief by selling you a false remedy.  One that numbs you to the pain or clouds the mind of the memories.  This counterfeit elixir not only robs you of your senses, but of the lessons you are here to learn.  Walk bravely into the epic you chose.  A flat line is not life.  There are peaks and valleys.

Not an anti-depressant, but Adderall (for ADD). It made me mean! And I'm a very nice person in real life. But it made me agitated and aggravated. I would verbally pick fights (and I never do that!). I finally figured out it was the medication and stopped taking it. After 3 days it was out of my system and I was back to my nice self again.

Only now they want to own it and regulate it.

It hasnt been shown to cure anything. But the evidence available suggests it has an effect on on glioblastomas. They think it is acting on the abnormal mitochondria it that type of cancer and triggering cell death in cells that have abnormal mitochondria. The research was halted because it looked like the DCA was damaging nerves. Newer work has given reason to doubt the nerve damage was caused by the dca but its something that is a serious concern. A treatment for cancers like this would be nice but if it causes brain damage then it is harder to justify its use as a treatment or especially to justify testing on humans. That said its an interesting chemical that is worth investigating. You should be more careful when calling something a cure. Nerve damagehttp://m.neurology.org/content/66/3/324Potential usefulness http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/31/31ra34

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6uujlt/cancer_conspiracy/dlvi6z5/?st=j8scv3bi&sh=0f1121f1Fire is also a cure for cancer, but you won't survive either.

These two subjects are so far apart that this like saying MK Ultra is just as proven as flat earth. Homosexuality is not a mental illness ffs. Perhaps you‚Äôd like us to go back to the days of performing electro-shock therapy to suspected homosexuals?

Come on bro it is totally normal to want to cut off your penis.

A mental/emotional state in which somebody is so dissatisfied with their physical being that they seek to alter it by any means necessary, going so far as to undergo massive bodily transformations via hormone replacement therapy and permanently disfiguring their reproductive organs.Somehow we've reached a point where people will actually sit there and argue that "it's because the rest of the world wont let them be who they really are."

So you defend old psychiatric terms and diagnoses? maybe you are forgetting that "being against the establishment" was considered a mental illness too, and used in very opportunistic ways in history. Even today being into conspiracy theories is still associated with different degrees of paranoia.I'm unsure if your comment is more pro-psychiatry or more against homosexuals/trans.

Because bell curves are not a thing in nature...also be like OP give some sources don't just claim the feels.

That's why we're doing this :)It's an incredible story!

Indeed, [I've added this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74axem/rconspiracy_round_table_6_medical_conspiracies/dnxklvb/) to this thread.

Great book, especially for someone living in New Orleans

The race to create the polio vaccine was a race entirely based on hubris and not philanthropy. Those at the forefront didn't care how sloppy the science was or how many children were maimed in the process.Dr. Alton Ochsner, [whose story I get into here](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74axem/rconspiracy_round_table_6_medical_conspiracies/dnxklvb/), even tested one of these experimental polio vaccines on his two grandchildren, killing one and paralyzing the other.These people have no compunction.

Read the book "The Virus and the Vaccine" and prepare to be stunned.

Unless you are doing something that is easy to check, it's unlikely that someone will actually do the experiments again. So if you fake those results, you can get a paper published quite easily.Some fields are inherently much easier to cheat with, and basically all the softer sciences are full of p-hacking and low sample sizes allowing shitty results.But even in harder sciences like physics, some retard that caused clocks to be desynchronized manage to publish faster than light neutrinos. We're at a point where basically only a few papers can be proven right correctly easily: pure mathematical papers, using automated systems that can check your proof, and computer science (though that's kinda math as well I guess), since the cost of running an algorithm is moderate.Now obviously for theoretical physics, the big shit that breaks previous laws is going to be doubted, so other people will do experiments to confirm the results, but the paper still often manages to be published first. For medicine though, you are likely out of luck and big pharma can definitely fake the results of some experiments.I also talk from experience, in my case I was asked no proof of my results or anything, as long as it's not news breaking nobody is likely to check. I put honest results because I have ethics, but I definitely see how easy it would be to fake them, especially if you have grants or graduation hinging over it.

we need a bot that posts stories like this daily in every appropriate sub

In addition to the great responses below/above/wherever this one ends up....I don't know about reversing existing damage but you might be interested in anti-oxidants in general but specifically:PQQ:"Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) is a B vitamin-like enzyme cofactor that helps to protect mitochondria from oxidative stress and promotes the generation of new mitochondria within cells."This is a great product as Now Foods have "CoQ10 and Acetyl-L-Carnitine included for their critical roles in mitochondrial function and energy production" along with the PQQ and also B-12 another important vit. for cellular function/health. You can also purchase CoQ10 and A-L-C separately but the PQQ combination is a pretty good coverall:https://iherb.com/pr/Now-Foods-PQQ-Energy-30-Veg-Capsules/61250 Articles for further reading:https://blog.bulletproof.com/pqq-boost-the-energy-in-your-cells-to-do-everything-better/http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2011/2/Generate-Fresh-Mitochondria-with-PQQ/Page-01http://michaelrucker.com/sandbox/pqq/pqq-rich-food/Assuming you probably already do but in case you don't I would follow as strict a dietary regime of fermented foods (ie. kefir, sauerkraut, kombucha tea) +++leafy dark greens, avoiding as much as poss. anything inflamm. and increasing consumption of things rich in anti-inflamm. properties such as turmeric, garlic, ginger etc...vaping or using cannabis, CDB and hydrating+++ with clean water.The Wim Hof method of breathing would be of great value too I would imagine which is basically forced deep breathing the length of your focused period of breathing you can increase as you develop the technique.TLDR - increase the density and specific intake of orthomolecular/macro/micro nutrients, increase clean hydration+++, increase focused respiration+++ and get decent sleep while attempting as best poss. to eliminate inflammatory agents in your life/diet.This is by no means exhaustive or professional advice this is what I find works for me but could be tweaked/improved no doubt.

Mitochondria have the DNA structure of a bacteria and often are compared to *Rickettsia*. But, yes, they are certainly organelles that animal cells are codependent on. In a sense these "bacteria" hold the noose around or necks though.

I believe the idea is that, since cells themselves are basically the evolution of a number of symbiotic microorganisms, the structure of mitochondria is similar in function to bacteria therefore it may be the best term available to summarize its lifecycle.

Why not?  Wikipedia uses the term 'bacteria' to describe them.  They were once bacteria.

Travis Christofferson's book "Tripping over the Truth" talks about this theory and the history of how cancer came to be thought of as being caused by genetic mutations. It is such a great read, very hard to put down.Edited to add: it discusses mitochondria a lot - it's a key part of the metabolic theory of cancer. 

Yes, Seyfried is a pioneer in this field. The amazing thing is that mitochondrial medicine has much to do with preventative medicine. Hopefully we can see a shift in ideology regarding this. There is a famous study where mitochondria are actually used as "bombs" (their typical mode when apoptosis is triggered) to destroy cancer cells through reactivation of suppressed apoptotic signal. ref: *Design and Synthesis of a MAO-B-Selectively Activated Prodrug based on MPTP: A Mitochondria-Targeting Chemotherapeutic Agent for Treatment of Human Malignant Gliomas*, Baskin et al. 2015

Much has to do with readings on epigenetics and the communication and connection between mtDNA and nDNA. The patterns and programs that our physiology develop based on environment and other inputs are as important as the actual bio marker indicating disease. 

We have an infant that was given lots of antibiotics immediately after birth (we think unnecessarily) and he has not been thriving quite as much as his peers.  We feel this is related to the antibiotics he was given.  Any tips on reversing the damage would be much appreciated.

Donald sabin had less polio votes yet he won

changed my downvote, this place could use some humor

LOL the shills are downvoting you for making fun of them. (And people with no humor) 

Just because you've had the flu shot doesn't mean you won't get the flu. You should know this if you are in nursing school. That's like saying you won't die in a car accident if you are wearing a seatbelt. 

> I am totally for vaccinating against deadly or debilitating diseases, but the flu is not one of themyou're a nursing student and you don't think the flu is a deadly disease??? People die from the flu all the time-Med student

Whoops meant for parent.

And yet so many seem to be profiting so well off exactly that.

*hard for 'them' to profit. you profit immensely.

> and it was removed from the Indian Journal of Medical Ethicswow didn't know! That must have happened since I gathered this info a number years back.Thanks for all your contributions to this thread btw.

Lmao that's not a defense for homeopathy, scrutinise the medical world all you want but homeopathy is straight up quack science and does literally no good for you.

What I like to remind people is that the word Pharmacy is derived from the word Farm, where back in the good old days, the remedies were found at the local farm to help the sick and ill... I see eyes brows raised when I mention this.Again work in Health Care, the amount of people i see carrying in a bag of medications, I mean some people are taking 10-18 different meds, all mainly Medicare / Medicaid / Tricare insured patients. These people are so fucked up they believe they are lucky to be over treated and the hands of Doctors who are pushed by the Pharmaceutical companies.  

You are right, I would not want many treatments mentioned in that (1889) book. Being pre-antbiotics, he often mentions "try this and if that fails, then maybe this..."My point as it applies to the topic is that there was (a now famous) medical blackout of Cannabis-as-medicine in the 20th Century.Dr. Beard further comments that headache affects "every household" and that people are "obliged to treat themselves".So, we have had a hundred years of "take an aspirin and call me in the morning" (Bayer again!) When it would have been "take a cannabis pill...", unless of course it is discovered to fail it's hype! 

Sippin on that syzzurp

Went to South Korea in 2000. Had to get the experimental anthrax vaccine. It's six shots. If you're going to get sick, it usually happens on the 4th shot. Developed endocrine system disruption disorder (they don't call it gulf war syndrome anymore). My mitochondria are fucked  (chronic fatigue is a huge part of the symptoms). Took 15 years, but I then went on to develope MS. IBS was the first symptom of the MS. 

A recent study showed service members much more likely to get ALS

They require new vaccines especially for food industry

I've been waiting for comments like these, thank you so much!!

I'll check it out.  Thanks for the link!

It was daunting for me at first but I soon realised this is a bigger and more important con than most 'conspiracies' I have ever looked into.

I watched it too and its useless information. He literally doesn't even say anything connected to this age issue.  Im not saying what he presents is questionable or so out there that it is unbelievable. I am saying that he literally doesn't say anything at all about the subject. Wth..is this just a simulation where people are seeing shit I'm not or are people just that stupid?

What evidence do you have that we are living longer? Please, I would love to be wrong about this. But when I thought about it, I realised that I was never shown empirical data to prove we were living longer. I was just told over and over again that 'life expectancy has risen', like an Orwellian mantra.Two legs bad, four legs good.

He's trying to red-pill the average population on how many people are brainwashed into accepting a life of slavery with hopes of a grand pension and retirement when the prospect of retirement is an illusion. People blindly accept that we're living longer without questioning it, without asking for evidence. If we're told from a young age that we're living longer than ever before, we just accept as a truth. In his metaphor once the cows are finally old enough and worked hard enough for their big payout and retirement, they're led to the slaughterhouse and killed. 

> We do live a little longer. About 10 years.How do you know that?

What is your point? You think your undocumented, anecdotal observations at one cemetery prove that people are living longer today? 

> These errors are made by the actual healthcare providers and not big corporations, so it is something that will be fixed, as those who provide healthcare USUALLY actually care about the patients and their well being.If it was up the providers, there would be no errors at all.

Being the No. 3 cause of death I rather let an AI to check my vitals, body and give me a diagnosis than a physician (maybe even surgery one day). Don't get me wrong, some people really care and work an insane amount of hours, but i'm pragmatic about results.

Wouldn‚Äôt this number be inflated anyway though? I have no numbers or data for this, but anecdotally, if someone has an illness or injury that would kill them, and they get treatment, more often than not the treatment would work out and they wouldn‚Äôt die, so it drastically lowers death rates of the disease. But if there‚Äôs complications and the person dies, no matter what the disease or injury was, they would all be grouped as medical errors? I‚Äôve also thought that saying cancer is the top cause of death is just as disingenuous, because there are hundreds of different types of cancers that arise for thousands of different and very complex reasons that have both environmental or genetic origins (or both). Cancer is just the big overarching term for when your cells forget how to kill themselves and keep multiplying, but it‚Äôs not one disease, it‚Äôs more like a characteristic symptom

Bayer huh?They probably realized the tech would make 99% of their bullshit obsolete. 

Could we make it ourselves?

You mean patent the idea so nobody else can make it?

Wow, that's an interesting video. I wonder how many people think he's just spouting bullshit.

So true that you have to grieve and medication robs you of that lesson. I have a personal theory that this is why the veterans of the Viet Nam War are the most connected to the debilitating PTSD. They used opium heavily throughout their trauma and therefore never processed it properly.

Thanks for the link! I will definitely check it out. 

I took Adderall to get through college and your sentiment "it made me mean" is the same exact thing I've told my friends.

I'm sorry!  You are correct, I did not mean to say "cure" but shown to significantly shrink different types of cancers. Not only Glioblastomas, but Liver, Pancreatic and other various forms. Cure was not the correct word for my comment. But yes, it does show some promise. 

> Homosexuality is not a mental illness ffs.are you familiar with the history of its reclassification?> Perhaps you‚Äôd like us to go back to the days of performing electro-shock therapy to suspected homosexuals?since you apparently believe in the concept of mental illness (i do not), would it be fair for me to 'deduce' that you approve of insulin shock therapy?

> Homosexuality is not a mental illness ffs.Aren't you jumping to conclusions?  I think you're agreeing with OP.

but it gets cold dunking it in the toilet

I'm indicating that public opinion is up for grabs, and the meme or memes I'm referring to are telling people that psychotropics (like cannabis) are the cause, rather than identifying the drugs responsible as pharmaceuticals.Da fuck is wrong with your reading comprehension, boy?

 

I don't know, I can see it.  Have you ever done the math on how much blood a patient actually gives for testing during an admission?  It's more than one might think.  A young patient can handle this no problem, but if you have an elderly patient who is already borderline anemic, and stick them in a hospital bed for 2 weeks, it seems to me like you could definitely pull off a lot of iron.

I've worked a lab too. What do you say about this? http://www.mdedge.com/ccjm/article/109827/geriatrics/are-we-causing-anemia-ordering-unnecessary-blood-tests>In the case of blood draws, the volume of blood drawn is significantly increased by unnecessary testing, resulting in higher rates of hospital-acquired anemia.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1490143/>Phlebotomy is highly associated with changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels for patients admitted to an internal medicine service and can contribute to anemia. This anemia, in turn, may have significant consequences, especially for patients with cardiorespiratory diseases. Knowing the expected changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit due to diagnostic phlebotomy will help guide when to investigate anemia in hospitalized patients.http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/747875>The findings indicate that reducing blood loss from phlebotomy could limit the development and severity of hospital-acquired anemia. **This could be accomplished inexpensively by using smaller blood tubes, such as those made for pediatric patients**, filling standard tubes with less blood, relying more on stored serum samples, or simply reducing unnecessary, scheduled blood tests, according to the authors. I got to work a lab, I've seen the little belt fed pockets that contain samples that are like 50 x less than the vacationers they draw from. Your argument doesn't support you, it supports me.

>Have you ever tried to fill a pediatric tube?Did it all the time.> Now, there are new ways of testing that resemble glucometers that I'm all for that also use finger stick with good efficacy. I would gladly see these replace standard vacutainers.Yea, but most hospitals don't want to buy new equipment when what they have is working.

> Further, anemia isn't even recommended to be treated by transfusion until it drops below something like 7 g/dL because of the risks associated with transfusion. At the two places I worked we transfused at 8.5>The hospital blood bank does not send that many units to the floor.Not true.>[Approximately 36,000 units of red blood cells are needed every day in the U.S](http://www.redcrossblood.org/learn-about-blood/blood-facts-and-statistics)There are not 36,000 stabbings, shootings, and car wrecks every day in the US. These are mostly units of blood going to people whose H/H is low because of phlebotomy.

She is still dealing with issues from the lyme disease and it's been close to 10 years since she was diagnosed with it, probably closer to 15 years since she was misdiagnosed with MS. Lyme disease aint no joke. 

a suh dude.

d121212 is correct. The major ways are: proper diet according to your needs, exercise, and supplementation (COQ10, other "cocktails" which contain enzymes or vitamins, even metformin has been shown in lower doses to assist)Depending on the type of disease you have: primary or secondary, the clinical outlook varies. Primary mitochondrial disorders/dysfunction are typically derived from mother and are often full scale deletions of portions of mitochondrial DNA that relate directly to proteins on the electron transport chain. Imagine a portion of the "circle of energy" (circular mitochondrial DNA) breaks, almost the like the ouroboros breaking.Secondary mitochondrial diseases are lifestyle induced and consequences or comorbidities with common chronic diseases and inflammation. Primary mitochondrial dysfunction can be readily tested through genetic testing, however secondary dysfunction is often a web of nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA that is harder to detect and can be reversed! There are a few upcoming therapies for primary dysfunction, however the treatment is ideally applied pre-conception through maternal screening. For example if a mother believes she may carry a mitochondrial disease, she can have the nucleus of her egg be transplanted on a donor egg with healthy mitochondria (the "three-person baby" phenomenon). The mitochondria has very little to do with developmental phenotype besides providing adequate energy and so I do not see it as a three person baby. 

Thanks, I appreciate the insight. I'll look into this further, but I'm glad to hear that it should be possible to reverse damage. 

Thank you for this info! I appreciate the advice. I'm familiar with CoQ10, but that's the first time I've ever heard of PQQ. I've got to get my diet back on track, but I was eating a lot of raw fermented foods and ginger before. I'm going to add them back in, along with some more of those anti-inflammatory foods. I also am getting an RO filter installed at my apartment, so I will have clean water shortly. Wim Hof is something that I actually looked into for a long time and researched. Ultimately, I wasn't really comfortable pursuing it, but I did begin taking cold showers/ice baths without the breathing component. I'm in the FB group and I follow any new developments/research involving it, so it's something I might add to my regiment in the future. 

That is the best theory for their origin, but they are recognized on Wikipedia as organelles.

One could argue that there are clearer and more concise ways to describe them. 

Thanks. Will look into it

The flu shot is 100% junk science...don't EVER get the flu shot.

Did you even read my post?

They do know this, and they are telling you about it.  Reread what they said.

yeah those darn international yoga corporations destroying the world with their greed, their insatiable desire for getting a 12th yacht.

21 days in a row of yoga. And I was the last guy to even think about doing this before a month ago. Its life changing. 

Homeopathy may be quack science, but if "medicine" is more harm than cure you are better off with a placebo.Rich people went to homeopaths, because outcomes were better for many things if you just took a placebo, up until just the last few decades.

In health care as well.  18 meds is common, double that is common.  Most of the chronic disease we see can and should be treated with food first, medications last, but almost never are.

I am pretty certain that the military are some of the first ones to get experimental vaccines.  Like, first human trial type stuff.  Also, do not forget that many of the military bases have VERY nasty water in their supply.  I heard of a lawsuit against Camp Lejeune for a lot of sercice members and their families having much higher rates of disease / cancer.  I need to look it up for details.   

A study done by whom?

Hey friend, I'm sorry to inform you that you've been shadowbanned by the reddit admins, which is unfortunate because you seem like an honest and legitimate contributor.As a /r/conspiracy mod, I can only approve your comment and inform you of your predicament, sorry :/I recommend you contact the reddit admins ASAP...good luck!

FALSE

Thats all well and good, but that video that linked is literally factless. Its a diatribe on conspiracy. Go ahead, watch it and tell me he offers any proof of *anything*. He just talks and talks about the retirement age being a hoax, but doesnt ever say how the life expectancy hasn't changed. Is it the average age? No actual medical advances? Less death from simple maladies like pneumonia or diarrhea? I mean, there must be a basis for why he thinks there is some sort of hoax or misinformation, but he doesn't delve into it! Frustrating and a waste of 7 minutes. 

> or are people just that stupid?

Ya, just rambles on.

Here is a link too the CDC page. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htmThere is a good PDF in there that shows the steady increase of the age that people are dying. Personally I do not consider a random YouTuber who presented little to no facts and thinks quoting George Orwell will make his point any better. Can you provide any factual data that people are significantly younger?? I found an article that noted a decrease of 0.1 years, but unless that keeps up for many years I do not consider it significant.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancyIts an average, more people are living into old age(60-70+), its people not dying young from preventable disease, accidents, war, malnutrion, etc, that are raising the average. There has always been people who lived into old age, just far less.I think science wise we are on the verge of extending peoples lives beyond the natural cap of about 70-80 years.

So you link a YouTube video with literally no evidence but you can't do a 2 second Google search that would show you literally countless piles of evidence? Do you discredit all sources of this evidence?

Do you live in a capitalist country? Your retirement is entirely in your hands. Unless we have a breakdown of society/more collapsed banks. They are fucking with Social Security in America too, but that doesnt mean that you need to be among the people led to the slaughterhouse.hat there are old people strugglling to survive is heartbreaking. I wish that the government wouldnt be trying to fuck them more. Sadly, its one of several issues that doesnt get enough coverage. Again though, if you prepare now you dont have to worry about this, for yourself at least.I repeat: **Your retirement is *completely* within your hands**

https://www.infoplease.com/us/mortality/life-expectancy-age-1850-2011In 1900 a 30-year-old male could expect to live to 65, today they could expect to live to 78https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancyIn late medieval English peerage, "At age 21, life expectancy was an additional 43 years (total age 64)."A 21-year-old member of the English aristocracy could expect to live to age 64 in the 1200s.It's a complete myth that we're no healthier today than in other ages. We live longer and die less of sickness. And lots of people *did* drop dead from illness or childbirth back then.

no. quite the contrary. I was backing up your life expectancy hoax conspiracy with my anecdotal observations. this cemetery had dead people from recent times and people who died roughly 80 years ago and they all died in similar age groups and none of the age groups are long lives. my point was that in this one case study my findings suggest that all these people even in quite recent of times all die between 24-66 at the oldest which would back up your claim that we are not 'living longer' I don't know why you had to be a dick but your comment was quite dickish. fyi when people are agreeing with you don't be a dick and try to argue with them. kthanksbai

Maybe. Vibration therapy is used by therapist.Sorry this might be a little long. I accidentally may have found a frequency that seems to have ended my FMS overnight. I have had chronic achy pain for 40 years. Not joints just fascia. I literally thought everyone hurt until sitting in a class on fibromyalgia while in school.  I never responded well to meds ( or wasn't willing to put up with the side effects). I usually took a tramadol & just kept moving. 2/16 I ended chemo and started a drug that gave me joint pain for the first time ever. 12 months later I stopped it almost unable to walk. My son races cars and we had just bought a large car hauler. Because I could not sleep I climbed into a little bed over the generator .  I slept the first time for 10 hrs. When I woke up something was different.  The achy pain was gone. A very strange feeling since I live with it everyday. It took 4 months to get the other medicine out of my system and get rid of the joint pain but the familiar aching has really never returned. Sometimes I actually missed it because it was apart of me. I have laid on it a couple of times since but really just because.  I have had another reaction to a different medicine so I have about given up on all of them.  I have told several drs and they don't know what to think except not to stop. These are drs. That know my history and now I have stopped all but reflux medicine.  I was taking meds for chronic migraines but have since stopped them with no problem. ( 20 or so a month).   I hope this wasn't confusing.  I wish I knew how to tell what frequency it is. 

> Could we make it ourselves?Indeed we *can*!  http://www.royal-rife-machine.com/If you search you can find plans etc onlineSadly, the Propaganda Big Pharma have used to 'teach' Joe Public 'what to think', has been successful in indoctrinating the 'people'  into believing that *only a doctor* has 'the knowledge and skills' to treat people's diseases With *drugs* made by them which can *only* be obtained on prescription are *the only* and *right way* to 'behave' when it comes to 'treating *all* diseases' Big Pharma *are "The* Ultimate (legitimized) Dealers" and the CIA are their 'black market' counterparts. This method of "control and prescription" has been a fabulous method for keeping their customers committed to 'coming back' to their 'brand'! OTOH, what are known as well known *successful* alternative medical treatments, are shunned and vilified by the 'traditional western/allopathic' model of medicine, I.E. acupuncture and 'traditional Chinese medicine' using herbs Or the use of macrophages to treat bacterial infections OR devices like Rife's 'resonators' The 'business methods' used by these ruthless companies is well developed and will continue to oppose *any and all* 'competition' to *their* product.  Oil companies have done the same thing for the past 100+years *suppressing* ALL information re: ''alternative energy generation/collection systems" BUT, thankfully the internet has been a Huge facilitator in the advance of Ideas like Rife's (and Tesla et al) and hopefully our future *will include* such technology as scientific developments put the old 'biases' of "conventional medicine" to bed. The medical establishment is a stubborn beast and slow to change! e.g. although it *was clearly demonstrated* in 1986 that a *bacteria* (Helicobacter Pylorii) *caused* stomach ulcers and was easily treated with conventional medications (antibiotics and antacids) ... even twenty years later  And I wouldn't be surprised if some doctors *still don't* know about it!**In Fact:** *many* 'doctors' were unaware of this information even *10 yrs later* in the 1990's and some even later! Some maybe not at all!   Even though Big Pharma products are needed to treat it they didn't promote it at all! (Pharma sales reps often keep drs 'up to date' with "the latest" medical news and treatments) Bottom line, when A.I's like Deep Blue begin to make *much better* ''diagnosticians'' that a human doctor who make many precribing errors. Ergo, correct diagnoses (instead of 'educated guesses') will begin to 'subdue' much of the  inaccurate and "over prescribing" of Big Pharma's products currently occurring worldwide will stop! (I'm not holding my breath but!)

Yes! I stopped taking it.

all i saw in my admittedly cursory look was glioblastoma, but the effect on mitchondria implies it would have an effect on a few others. the real trouble with cancer treatment is that there are a lot of ideas that show promise but when we get them into bigger better trials they almost always disappoint. what gets me excited is the possibility that we found out why. it looks like our gut bacteria have been eating cancer drugs. if thats really true and is common with many of the treatments we‚Äôve tried then we might soon be able to go back and make a huge number of these drugs that failed human tests work, and we might be able to get results with lower doses of the drugs we already use. this is where i want to see money go.http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6264/1079

> believe in the concept of mental illness (i do not)As someone who suffers from OCD, can I ask you to explain why? I see no other way of categorising it.

Why don't you believe in mental illness? I understand if you don't believe homosexuality or any other condition isn't a mental illness but it's a little weird to not believe in mental illness at all. 

No idea what you‚Äôre talking about. On both counts. Enlighten me.

/r/bigdickproblems

Common sense in the ICU said that we pooled blood draws and only drew as much as we needed and to call the lab to add on tests with extent blood instead of resticking people.  The studies showed a correlation between length of stay in the hospital and H&H levels and they account this to be in because of phlebotomy sticks.  But, it doesn't say what contributing factors are taking into consideration (e.g.- kidney injury leads to decrease in erythropoietin production and results in decreased blood marrow production and therefore, a decreased H&H or that an increased production of inflammatory bodies from an infection can decrease RBC production). Certainly we want to remove as little blood as possible that's needed, but there are other factors at play in determining anemia causes

 

So.. What came of it?

Yeah, why wouldn't they care?  This makes no sense?  What possible motive could a cabal of scientists have for covering this up?  Do you have any idea how science works?  Scientists aren't partners, they're competitors.  By and large their strongest desire is to prove other scientists wrong.  If any scientist can actually prove a link between vaccines and autism they would shoot to the top of the pantheon of scientists.  How could you possibly orchestrate a conspiracy like that in such a competitive environment?  This is as absurd as suggesting that all the sprinters in the world have been conspiring to let Usain Bolt win.

Moose was fucking awesome. I hope he's well. 

Chronic illnesses that don't have any visual symptoms.  ME, FIBRO, CFS, COLD, EDS etc are all invisible illnesses. My aunt was bit by a tick and is now allergic to all mammals. She can eat fish and birds, but she is so allergic to meat protein she has to get medically supervised fillings because the bonding agent has derivitave of horse hooves in it. She carries epi pens now. 

Oh I've been meaning to add to this and then saw your reply/comment. Coffee enemas. Sounds far out/a bit suss to suggest from a complete random over the internet but I would consider it a huge, crucial addition to the above in terms of allowing your body to fully release a lot of the toxicity you carry around. Real easy to DIY no  drugs or major medical/scientific knowledge needed either and info abounds on the www.As far as I'm aware there's no deep or mystical psycho-spiritual aspect to Wim Hof's method but I guess he sourced a lot of it from Eastern influences but essentially I think it is just yoga/applied/mindful breathing and is comparable to Groff's "Holotropic" breathwork. At it's extremes I would imagine they could allow OBE/astral experiences tho. Hyper oxygen saturation is a good thing for most people with their postures and hypo-breathing norms.

This, they are organelles.

what would you say?

Maybe the flu shot isn't about the flu at all?  Maybe it is a vehicle for testing things.  Especially now as easily as big data can track your health and everything else about your lifestyle, it *would* be the perfect vector for human experimentation.

Per the CDC, it's one of the only vaccines to still contain mercury https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/thimerosal.htm Check out the Simpsonwood Transcript where a conference of scientists got together to discuss mercury in vaccines (because of the amount of reports from their patients) since the levels exceed safe levels (any amount shot into the blood stream does).  http://skeptico.blogs.com/Simpsonwood_Transcript.pdfThis conference is what "helped" remove mercury from (most) vaccines and replaced it with aluminium (because of their findings and debate).  Aluminium is no better and there have been no tests that show the effect both mercury and aluminium have on the body with combined.

Agree 100% Work in health care in the US and have done for 16 years, it's all a load of me bollix with that Flu shot bullshit.

This is such a fallacy, I personally believe in medicine but if you think it's harmful that's your perogative. My only confusion is how that justifies homeopathy - even if medicine is harmful, how is literal superstition any better. Find an alternative medicine with ACTUAL science behind it like drinking green tea and excercising regularly or some shit, don't use homeopathy and don't encourage others to do so, it's just misinformation.

Not forgetting some exercise within the ability of their issues. Agree.

man I cant recall, saw it on reddit like two months ago...a search found many results!

[removed]

That is a link. It is not proof. Tell us **which part** of that link you found most convincing. You can't, because you haven't read it - you have simply google searched and posted the link. You are proving the point being made.

> I think science wise we are on the verge of extending peoples lives beyond the natural cap of about 70-80 years.lol that is what the TV keeps telling us, 'medical breakthrough on the horizon'. They call it **programming** for a reason.

I asked you if you had any evidence. When did it become so offensive to people to ask them for evidence? And when did 'just google it' become an argument?I don't know how long people are living. The video in question makes the same point: everybody believes we are living longer but nobody seems to have any evidence. Your 'just google it' is implicit proof of the very point being made.

Well, minus the 15% of what you earn that the government takes from you to wisely invest so you don't just spend it on a junket or an exciting new vehicle or something.

Why do you believe the claims made on those webpages?

Fair enough, I apologise. I misunderstood you.

> I literally thought everyone hurt until sitting in a class on fibromyalgia while in school. I never responded well to meds ( or wasn't willing to put up with the side effects).

That's an amazing story ... imho you should do an IaMA or something about it ... I think you're correct in 'guessing' a 'connection' between that generator's effect on you and it would be well worth seeing if anyone else has had a similar experience> Sometimes I actually missed it because it was apart of me.Lol, I actually know what you mean! I had a terrible back pain for over a decade which was 'cured' with surgery, and I too *kindof* 'missed it' when it was gone, as, it *was* a 'part of me/my day' and affected *everything* I did!  IME people who 'feel this way' have been through a 'personal hell' and escaping from it seems kind of 'surreal' ... like something's *missing*! Which it *is*! I guess that's another demonstration of how well we/our bodies can adapt to all sorts of things

Was the drug levaquin?

Me too. Good for you, its not easy to kick. Glad you're on the other side.

> Why don't you believe in mental illness?i don't believe in mental illness because i regard mental illness as a metaphor which has been taken literally for so long that people regard it as an objective fact. to illustrate what i mean, consider the following parable:*susan told anthony that jan was hot under the collar. anthony immediately got out a thermometer and began measuring the temperature beneath jan's collar. moments later, he perplexedly announced that he could find no evidence that susan's assertion was true.*> I understand if you don't believe homosexuality or any other condition isn't a mental illness but it's a little weird to not believe in mental illness at all. to keep things country simple: i regard homosexuality as an unfortunate tendency, homosexual actions as sins, and belief in mental illness as credulous.

That sounds pretty reasonable, and like something an astute nurse would do, but as someone who has worked ICU, Cath lab, OR, and ER as an RN, I can assure there is nothing more uncommon than common sense.

Of course it's just an anecdote, but I've known a lot of people that have been patients in the ICU, and the only ones that needed blood transfusions were with the ones with blood loss from trauma.I had a relative that suffered trauma from her husband, and didn't realize til 2 days later when she passed out that her spleen had ruptured.  She had a shitload of transfusions.

It is the most amazingly frustrating thing in the world to watch someone's H&H drop the longer they stay in the hospital.  "Oh, it's dilutional," yeah sure, not if their platelets and everything else didn't go down with it.  Can't believe I never thought of iatrogenic blood loss.

I've worked as a circulator nurse in the OR, there are very few types of surgeries where blood loss is significant, when we do orthopedic surgeries we have surgical tourniquets. It is still the phlebotomy. I've already provided you links showing you it is the phlebotomy.

What a Tool.

Thanks for adding that. I've actually heard about coffee enemas before, it's just something I've never wanted to try for obvious reasons haha. But as I start improving my health, I will re-consider that. For Wim Hof, the main reason why I didn't opt for it is that I wasn't comfortable with the huge adrenaline spikes it causes. I'm a little wary of tinkering with my endocrine system in that way. But I do know it can have major health benefits and it is something that I may take up in the future. I'm hoping there will be more research studies coming out soon.

Well, it is a vehicle for testing things.  Among other things, testing theories and techniques for achieving compliance with advertised messages.  (It being a yearly campaign with very similar goals and execution every year, and nice measurable endpoints for success or failure, it is an ideal experimental platform for developing the field of propaganda.)

I personally believe in medicine as well, but I have no illusions over how harmful medicine was in the 1750s when homeopathy was invented.  Considering that medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death, even modern medicine can be quite dangerous.If a serious medical error hasn't happened *to you* that's fine, that's your prerogative to have blind faith in medicine.  However, as someone who works in hospitals, I don't.

You're misunderstanding them.  They aren't defending homeopathy, they're saying if homeopathy does nothing -- which you agree with -- and the medical treatment does actual harm, then you're better off doing nothing, i.e. homeopathy.

Damn lol.  Sucks that Reddit's search function is less than worthless.  

sorry to hear that =/I do think you need an email address to get your account restored, but I could be wrong about that.

I did read it... I can't link a PDF on here but the one titled "Life expectancy by age, race, and sex, 1900-2012 United States Life Tables, 2012" apecificly Figure 1 on page 5. check it out and let us know what you think. They are using actual mortality data to produce this. The burden of proof is not on me here. You are the one that needs to provide factual evidence to support your claims, because it goes against what everyone else already believes and knows.  A YouTube video of a guy with an accent is not factual evidence. Although I don't actually expect you to provide any evidence, maybe just another YouTube video, which doesn't count as evidence in my book. Or you just won't respond because you can't find any evidence and would rather just believe what you want to believe. Also what is the motive behind this "Conspiracy"??

awww just as I thought. No response from /u/Step2TheJep yet he seems to be active on this post in the recent hour. What is wrong? You said up above you >would love to be wrong >I was never shown empirical data to prove we were living longerI provided you with actual data....

Tell us **which part** of that video you posted provides any information refuting official statistics. Go ahead. You are so deep into your own brain that you post a link thats *worthless* and then challenge someone else to provide proof otherwise. Then when they do, you say >That is a link. It is not proof. Tell us which part of that link you found most convincing.Like...for real? Are you okay? If you were informed on the subject, you'd be able to discuss this in depth here in these comments. Instead, you play some game where you are trying to get other people to research for you?I read the .pdf he posted. Did you? It certainly has information in it that refutes your point. But wait, what is your point? You haven't said anything useful, and even worse, the video you posted is seriously underwhelming and doesn't directly refer to anything factual about **any** age study. He just hammers the Australian govt. for increasing the retirement age and describes how people are upset, while using Animal Farm to draw parallel's. Seriously man, don't post shit if you have **no basis and no ability** to back up what you post.

Do you know what plasma protein GDF-11 is?How about Regenokene?How about the latest stem cell research?None of that will be on the evening news. You have to go to Germany to even find people researching these things. Hows that for a conspiracy? Other governments are seriously taking huge steps, but American Universities and research teams are hampered by US law. Stem cell research should never have been fucked with. But I'm just programmed to be duped into believing this research, right?

Your point is literally that that video has no evidence, and all other evidence is questionable as well. But that we should 'be looking into it'.Fucking lame dude. 

psh, try 27%

I guess that's a good point, but I've never seen any evidence to the contrary, and frankly I don't see a motive behind lying about something like that. But I'd be open to reading any sources you might have

Yes that is how I feel. I have hurt for 40+ years but really felt lucky that I never had joint pain and I was so use to it that things like childbirth was snap.  It is really strange for it to be gone.   What is an IME. I don't really know much about Reddit.   But their is a therapist here in town doing vibration therapy but it is standing and at 20 minute intervals.  

 

Ah OK true I was not aware of that but of course that makes a lot of sense re Wim Hof fair point.

I don't have blind faith in medicine. I just have blind faith in homeopathy being bullshit. Because it is.

That is "life expectancy at birth." It's okay to use that in some arguments, but not for arguing that we need to increase retirement age. You don't want to count all of the people who died shortly after birth because those people didn't get to retire. In today's world, everything is safe. We don't have children working in coal mines and factories, we have all kinds of rules for driving, safety standards everywhere. When someone says "we need to increase retirement age because people are living longer," what they are essentially arguing is that retired people are more fit and healthy today, they can do satisfactory labor at 65, and live more years in retirement, which causes a burden on the system. You only want to compare people who lived to 65 in 1900 and life expectancy of people who are 65 today. You can probably find that somewhere and I wouldn't be surprised to see that retirement-age people are living longer today because fewer people smoke, fewer people worked in shitty factories as kids, etc. Once a person reaches 65, how long should they live on average?

 

I have not been shown empirical data. Somebody posted a link they clearly didn't even read.

> But I'm just programmed to be duped into believing this research, right?No, you might have evidence. Let's find out. What is your evidence?

>  I've never seen any evidence to the contraryWhere would you expect to find such evidence?

> It is mathematically impossible for it to be the phlebotomy.And yet you've read three peer reviewed published studies showing it is the phlebotomy.¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Of course it is.  It's still a shitload better than leeching and mercury (which was top-of-the-line care when homeopathy was invented).Even in modern medicine, placebo is better than treatment sometimes.

Did you mean to reply to /u/Step2theJep ?? Cause I think we are on the same side, in saying that he has yet to provide any data other than a narrator video of some australian complaining about the retirement age. NO data about life expectancy. Clearly this guy is a shill trying to discredit other conspiracies. 

>  I should send your post history to the feds. I dare you to.

Yet you have not shown any empirical data that we aren't... Why do you even care so much? This isn't really even a conspiracy. What, are you worried you aren't going to live as long as 'they' say you are?? The biggest factor in how long you will live is yourself and no one else.

Wtf? Evidence for what? Look up GDF11 and figure it out for yourself, I'm not here to teach you about it. I've clashed with you twice today. From two different parts of this thread. In both you are doing the same lame shit (Burden of proof, challenging others to present evidence and not presenting any yourself) that is indicative of shilling. If you are a shill, and some random internet user like me is out-arguing you with ease, then you suck at your job. Fuck you and the zionist pigs you work for. They should do a better job recruiting. 

Like I said I am open to being wrong! But do *you* have any sources I can look into? Or are you just going to ask pointless questions?

 

I do know that in The US the life expectancy for certain segments of the white population declined for the first time in recent history-mostly due to suicide and drug overdose.  But I'd like to see real data on this, it is very interesting.  I can't believe that video went on and on and he didn't even come close to stating facts or data on the subject-like what?https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-life-expectancy-declines-first-time-in-decades/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/health/death-rates-rising-for-middle-aged-white-americans-study-finds.html

>  Look up GDF11So no evidence then. Just as I suspected.

> I will concede that, with new information that was not presented in your articles, intensive care patients do lose enough blood to cause iatrogenic anemia.Okay

Yes I have seen the information you posted, and it is very interesting. But 1/10 of year is not a "conspiracy" as the OP would like us to believe. There is no power or group trying to make us die sooner, this discussion of life expectancy doesn't even belong on this sub in the first place.

[There is info here both for and against anti-aging, though I doubt you will read any of it. Or even understand it if you did.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10220)

There were so many openings for you to make so many good points, and this is what you chose?

So ill type what I've researched that relates to this roundtable. First I would like to start with the dogon tribe in Africa. They go way back and are believed to have originated from Egypt. Anyhow, in the 1930s some anthropologists visited them and asked some questions, they got on the topic of astrology and were astounded at some of the things they heard. The dogon told the anthropologists about the Sirius cluster back when many thought it was just one star they also compared the size difference accurately between the two stars and claimed that sirius-b was a white dwarf with a 50 year orbit around Sirius-a, they also knew about Uranus and Neptune. Now we come to find out later that all of theur claims have been verified. Again they made these claims before we even knew sirius b existed. Even the orbit of Sirius b comes out to be 50.1 years exactly. Obviously the anthropologists asked where they learned this astrological knowledge, and they said it was given to them by our creators, the nommo/nummo. They depict them as fish like humanoid beings which coincidentally are similar to depictions throughout other cultures, especially mesopotamian cultures. The rest of the creation myth aspects weve learned from them are pretty interesting, but all of this brings me to the enki enlil aspect. Watch or read Mauro Biglino if you have not yet heard of him and are interested in this stuff. Mauro was a prominent translator for the Vatican and some of their most ancient texts. He translated the oldest versions of the bible. Whats interesting is the interpretation, he was only allowed to interpret the words in the way the Vatican wanted them translated. When he translates the words the way he believes they were meant to be read the bible takes on a whole new meaning. Mauro is not a Christian and thinks the new testament is mainly fiction and that the old testament is a first hand account or diary of sorts from people that were living through an alien invasion/enslavement of mankind. The idea is that humans are millions of years old as a species and when earth was tiamat it got struck by another planet or ravaged by space war, and this species(elohim/annunaki) was on the losing side of the battle and got stranded on earth. The story in the bible also suggests the elohim altered our DNA while they were here. I've even read theories that the elite believe they descend from these bloodlines and that's why they have a divine right to rule in their minds. So all in all I would strongly suggest you all look into Mauro Biglino as well as the nommo and the dogon tribe, sorry if this was poorly put together, dont usually make this huge comments lol Edit: https://youtu.be/j4MXLB6SwPg(Link to translated discussion by mauro biglino, 6 part series the other parts are linked in video)

Copy paste from older thread.Whether it be Planet X, Nibiru, Nemesis, whatever you want to call it, I don't understand why the 'conspiracy' subreddit is so quick to call it bullshit.Let's look at the indicators.- Every ancient civilisation leaving writing and legends about cosmic cataclysms being a regular thing. Some of them even going so far as to have their whole society revolve around tracking them.- NASA going from 'Planet X is bullshit' -> 'There might be a planet x' -> `There is a planet x we just don't know where it is yet' - > 'Our sun might have a binary twin'.- Compelling evidence from whistle-blowers and investigators that billions have been spent over the last few decades building underground bases/cities in the USA and all over the world.- Revalations, Mayan astronomy, The Law of One all indicating that the next one is around this time.- Solid archaeological evidence continuing to surface of previous cataclysms (Hancock)- Increased erratic behaviour of natural disasters and climate change, with evidence that the magnetic field of large celestial bodies influences these things.Now one of these points isn't cause for concern. But all of them, when viewed together, seem to indicate that this threat is real and it's coming. And here we all are arguing over bullshit, calling each other shills, and labelling everything a psyop.

For starters, I've always been fascinated by the parallels between the ancient Sumerian epics and the theories of some astronomers like [Tom Van Flandern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Van_Flandern).The idea is there used to be a Saturn-sized oceanic planet between Jupiter and Mars (Tiamat) and it was destroyed in a cosmic battle, leaving behind the asteroid belt, comets, and possibly other objects like "Nibiru", Ceres etc.Van Flandern traced back the paths of scores of comets and found they converged at that location roughly 2 million years ago.Considering that we are in the process of reevaluating everything we thought we knew about the timeline of human history, it seems highly plausible that such a major event in the solar system would have been recorded in our most ancient lore.As for how the planet "exploded", that's a whole different matter...

If I have a general *belief* on human origin, this is it. I don‚Äôt preach it and I don‚Äôt necessarily believe every detail of it, but for the most part I just think this makes sense mostly because I‚Äôve always felt, almost instinctively, that we are an introduced species. The summary of it is that the Annunaki landed on earth at Euphrates River and colonised the first settlement of Eden. Their *mission* here was supposedly to mine gold to fix their home planet atmosphere. However the work was tough and environment didn‚Äôt suit them and so they genetically created man - an Annunaki-great ape hybrid. We were to be their labour force - not too smart to question our creators but not too dumb so that we couldn‚Äôt complete complex tasks. At some point they left earth and left us to our own devices. As primitive hunter-gathers we survived. At some other point in time they returned to teach us civilisation and they left again, forever. Where I think the strongest evidence of this (or something close to this) are; ‚Ä¢ in ancient texts, including the bible.‚Ä¢ in ancient culture including Sumerian, Aztec, Egyptian, Peruvian, Incan, Australian Aboriginal, and Easter Island.‚Ä¢ Sitchen transcripts. ‚Ä¢ Pye research (see Lloyd Pye). [Here](https://youtu.be/e5qJYwfAju8) is Pye at his best in my opinion. Stay with it. It‚Äôs a bit strange at first. ‚Ä¢ in that humankind seemingly stepped away from nomadic, primitivism, and almost within a generation learnt all the sciences and social sciences.‚Ä¢ global megaliths which I could talk about all night, but specifically their alignment and positioning. [This](https://youtu.be/2fS9ixfQ_no) is easily my favourite video on the topic (buckle in, it‚Äôs mind blowing).‚Ä¢ elongated skulls and otherworldly skeletons. I found [this](https://youtu.be/q3F4izUmoL0) to be fairly comprehensive on most discoveries to date while remaining reasonably objective. ‚Ä¢ the lack of a missing link of human evolution. ‚Ä¢ humankind‚Äôs [fused chromosome 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_2_(human). ‚Ä¢ and as I said above, the simple fact that I just believe humans are an introduced species.Anyway that‚Äôs me for now. I can‚Äôt wait to read this thread as it fills up and contribute more. EDIT: Added some links. EDIT: Stumbled across [this](https://youtu.be/NxMoZYutNGs) video on mummified aliens last night. 

 Was hoping this topic would win! Time to roll up, sit back, and learn from you guys. 

I am extremely discouraged to see that this has not even been mentioned here in this sub... Nibiru has already been pretty much established as a scientific possibility. No one really talked about it besides a few publications. Appalled that no one here remembers those articles. There is no speculation about it being a conspiracy.http://www.caltech.edu/news/caltech-researchers-find-evidence-real-ninth-planet-49523Caltech.edu enough credibility for ya? :)For those of you who still disbelieve, this is as real as it gets.

I already posted this on a different subreddit. Anyway this is titled: Possible Geologic Effects on Earth due to Nibiru fly-by.  First I've asked myself, what are the known and possible effects of the moon on Earth's present existence as we know it?  1: Ocean Tides  2: Axial tilt allowing for variable seasons through each part of the globe  3: (Theory) - According to [this National Geographic article](http://archive.is/BVtxS), lunar cycle may play a role in Earth's volcanic activity.  &nbsp;Assuming a brown dwarf will have a gravitational pull exponentially greater than the moon's but at same time be much, much further away, I wildly speculate the geological effects will be somewhat 5 to 10 times greater in each of the 3 "effects" I've listed.  &nbsp;Based on Zecharia's Sitchin 3600 year Nibiru orbit/flyby interval and assuming the Minoan eruption of 1600BC (circa 3600 years ago from present) was the last occurence, these were notable supporting geologic effect:  1.) BBC: [Giant wave hit ancient Scotland [3600x2 = 7200 years ago]](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/glasgow_2001/1531049.stm)  2.) As a result of the fly-by, Greenland (for argument's sake) may end up having a longitude similar to where southern Canada is at the present; thus Greenland may allow for more arable land during the "summer time". The closest "coincidence" supporting this theory of a major axial tilt, is that the Sahara dessert was once a plush green grassland with river's flowing through it. Unfotunately I can't come across a solid date for it; here's a article by [the smithsonian](http://archive.is/sCJMc).  3.) And of course the [minoan eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption) around 3600 years, that supposedly played a role, in Europe's first (as we know it) civilization, long predating the Greeks, the sea-faring (thalasocracy) Minoans (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization). Interestingly another sea-faring civilization sprung up after this catastrophe, and are credited with gifting the Greeks and Roman our [phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia) we take for granted.  &nbsp;I'm no where or anywhere near a qualified geologist, but when you have mainstream academics, claiming the [yonaguni monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonaguni_Monument) is a "rock formation" you gotta follow the coincidences and come to more logical conclusions.  If one has link or book, theorizing the effect of a second sun/large orbital body's geologic effect while being relatively close to earth it would be appreciated. When typing "What if jupiter was closer to earth" in search, I only get photoshops of jupiter in the night sky.

Most interesting to me about Sitchin is the idea that the Annunaki needed gold to spray in their atmosphere to protect them against global warming..He described Geo-Engineering / Chemtrails just with gold instead of aluminum in the 70s. Did the Sumerians really know about ancient extraterrestrial chemtrails? What does it mean for what we see in the sky today?It's all very weird to me.

Big fan of the Nebiru/Zecharia Sitchin theories (that's why I based my sci-fi series largely on them). What's amazing is all the parallels and coincidences you find between ancient cultures. Of course there are the big ones like the pyramids, the creation myths, the importance of snake symbolism. But there are also the smaller things like the commonality of twelve in ancient cultures:http://www.humanreligions.info/twelve.htmlPersonally, I don't know if this stuff is true, but it's fascinating to consider how it could all potentially fit together (which a lot of it seems to). And as a writer, it's allowed for a lot of fun world-building.

This is the Hidden Hand perspective.Disclaimer:This was not written for you. This was written by an Illuminati insider, for other insiders who had questions. These insiders came from lots of different programs and projects within the structure and after leaving were finding out that they all had been lied to just as much as the rest of us. So questions were submitted, and this blog was written as the answers.Shane held many positions within "the Illuminati" where he was taught very much about their system. When he left, he started meeting others who had left programs and projects who were starting to realize that they each had been told their own version of the truth, and that none it was actually the truth. Shane started providing them with answers to questions. To make it easier, someone suggested he put up a blog. So the blog is written by a guy in the know, for others in the know. It was never meant to be public, but got discovered when he mentioned the Blue Avians once. And the rest is internet history.However, and I can't stress this enough, the blog was used as a teaching instrument. It has a start, a method, and an end. It is meant to be read from the beginning, in order, a step at a time. Like any learning course, you need to advance one concept at a time to understand the bigger implications and meanings. Calculus won't make much sense if you haven't taken algebra. Start at the beginning, read one entry, and let it soak in for a day or two. And don't skip the comments, they are just as insightful, if not more, than the entries themselves.A word of caution though, it's one of those things that can be pretty heavy on your mind and soul. So tread cautiously but purposefully down this path if you choose. There's no going back.From [The Ruiner Blog](http://theruiner777.blogspot.com/2015/03/my-name-is-unimportant.html)**Annunaki***The most confused name this writer knows.*As it has been presented to the public, this word simply means alien or extra terrestrial.Others believe that the Draco are in fact this race.*With a slight variant on the name,* the Annunaki,  a race that created one of many versions of humanity, does indeed exist.  Their story is much older than the most recent interpretations suggest.  The most recent is a case of impersonation, by the Draco.Many elements of this translation are correct and many are incorrect, but the source material itself is a Draco creation.The word meaning "alien" has caused several races to address themselves as Annunaki when interacting with humans, confusing the name.  A true race, with a very similar name, is being used as a model by the Draco.The true Annunaki race lives on Nibiru. The Draco do not.  These Annunaki once created a human species utilizing an older hominid from earth, the Draco manipulated an already existing human species.Many have received contact with races who call themselves Annunaki and are then forced into arguments with people who know these translations as being a Draconian creation.  This is unnecessary.  The truth is in the middle.This is a race of humanoids who look like us in a larger size.  They are benevolent but apathetic or self-centered and they check in on this planet often despite having no authority beyond that gifted to them by the Draco. (This is changing of course)They will have dealings with us again, as the transition sparks a brand new cycle.Their true name is connected to the planet they come from and is not entirely dissimilar to the impersonated name which has become known also as alien.*Names, names, names..*Annunaki is not their name truly, and other races besides them have called themselves this.  The Draco used both their name - with a slight twist - and their image. One of many clever little mind fucks.The Draco have also completely erased the presence of some very close friends of the Annunaki.   Many older versions of humans also associate with them often.Apathetic?  They are not cruel, very kind, but they do not meddle.  They leave others to their own business, these days.They do seem to contact those of you who have had close encounters with the Draco, which shows a slight bit of willingness to push back and assist.  Yet they also have made some terrible, although honest mistakes when interfering with other races, and therefor they take a slightly stand-off approach to most other planets.*~We often find acceptance of the names that our enemies give to us in this physical reality.  Funny that.~*Nannun- Anu - Iunaki.. Annunaki.**Some more background*** Atlantis was a ship.  An alien mother ship filled with many races that landed here very long ago, integrated with the humans here, and a city and then culture grew around the ship.* Enemies of these aliens eventually found them, and a terrible war broke out in this galaxy.* A large earth-like planet that was between Mars and Saturn was destroyed.* Earth as a planet was "reset" and the humans and alien refugees from the war continued to live here but under very difficult conditions for a long time.* It was in this traumatized state that the Draco arrived.* A deal was struck where they were given control in exchange for help. It was a trap, and is the root of our control system today.* The Draco Empire: At the top of them all is the King. Anu.  He had many sons.  Two are known to you surely, as Enki and Enlil.* The Draco are not very creative, but they are masters at borrowing other's stories and writing themselves into it.  * The Draco have perverted all the ancient writings and materials we have.  The Sumerian Tablets, the Ra material (Law of One), Ancient Egypt, The Emerald Tablets.  You get the picture.* This doesn't mean we should disregard the materials.  They have much truth in them, otherwise you wouldn't attached to them and the hook wouldn't work. It's good to explore all materials, just don't build a belief system out of any one.* Everything dealing with the Annunki took place even way before all of the above.

"Woke" is knowing you are the source of all existence. "You are the One, Neo." And then learning how to co-create your reality back to harmonic intervals instead of the disharmonic chaos you birthed yourself in. This is God's Video Game, where you are one of the many Avatars of Conciousness. We are just now learning how to *truly* and beneficially affect the quantum field/matrix. This matrix is not the "enemy", nothing is truly the "enemy" because we are all the same thing, playing on different "sides" of forces. This matrix has just been heavily minced with mis-truth and illusionary distractions, which are fun unti you hit a certain point, as humanity is now. We are transcending into a higher Octave of existence, where negatively-oriented, self-serving traits such as greed and manipulation etc can not exsist vibrationally. We are watching the transition now, just the beginning. How it plays out is directly up to you and your quantum assumtions of the future-presence. We are all the "ONE" so we each have our own "path", yet we all end up at the same spot: The SOUL seat. Sole, Sol, One, "Son/sun of God". You are that One., "Believing" =/= Knowing, which is why religions are a poor perversion of this truth. Placebo can not be manufactured. Faith cannot be "hoped for". You will know when you know. Decided to post this and see what resonates, or which belief systems I have offended, and how I can help fellow humans dissove their own personal prisons. We are different 'Cells' of the same existence. Can one (or a small majority of) braincell(s) cause a cascading effect on others in a beneficial, logical, and truthful way? Look up the 100th monkey effect and see how it pertains to human consciousness. On a small scale, It's like changing the plasticity of your brain, One group of braincells understands that starting a new, healthier habit will be better in the long run, but is faced with the overwhelming discomfort/pain of the other braincells that have to change/grow/adapt to the newer, healthier paradigm. Which is why habits are so hard to break and create. our human brain is a microcosm of our collective mind. Only need a few persistent braincells to start the domino effect on enlightenment, and the surrender of lower-logical structures/assumtions of reality, so they can be "washed away/transmuted" into "higher octaves/higher levels of order". Thus the "death" and "ressurection" of humanity.Just seeing what resonates, this is all I got for now. Thanks for reading 

I've long felt that instead of looking for "ancient astronauts," we should be looking for ancient humans.Any evidence I've seen for the former seems theoretically consistent with the latter, and an advanced collection of humans guiding the development of less advanced human societies seems far more likely than alien visitation.

This is by far my favorite type of content, however the timing of introducing this topic amidst everything going on geopolitically in the world may cause this thread to overlooked.

Is there any chance that someone who is knowledgeable in this topic can make like an ELI5 version and it can get stickied? Because I am an absolute noob to this concept and I am sure many others are too

[I'll just leave this here](http://sitchiniswrong.com/)

Enki and Enlil were REPTILIANS.

Albert Tarantola was a highly respected geophysicist at *Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris* who also taught at Princeton and Stanford and was one of the inventors of Inverse Theory. He thought there was an advanced civilization before Sumer before the last big glacial melt in what is now the Persian Gulf and was accumulating funds to perform a shallow high resolution seismic survey in the Gulf to look for the ruins when he passed. He did not publish much of his material in this area because it was unfashionable amongst his colleagues. There is a small amount still on his preserved web site including this paper:  [Shoreline reconstructions for the Persian Gulf since the last glacial maximum by Kurt Lambeck](http://www.ipgp.fr/~tarantola/Files/Professional/Lambeck/Lambeck-1996.pdf)If anybody knows of his students pursuing this work I would be very interested to see it.

Simplest research exposes Sitchin, just like Erik van Daniken, as Rockefeller stooges. I am disappointed in the inability of this sub to shake these poisoned theories off and see clearly. Is it so hard to see that the entire UFO agenda and alien origins of man are Hollywood driven? This crap will lead you nowhere at all. It only induces into your mind inferiority of humans, and this is the aim.

I have been hoping for this topic for a long time.  Please read my user history.  I have seen a black cube UFO.  Zecharia Sitchin translates that the Archons or Annunaki, flew around in black cubes.  I have seen a black cube UFO.  If anyone ever sees one, please report it in my subreddit, r/BLACKCUBEUFO.  Thanks!  I will sit back and read all the great comments in this thread now.

The annunaki stories are the first religion known to man. All other religions come from it. Creation of man, through the wars in heaven everything is touched on here. I do not really believe in nibiru in the way we accept it. I'm thinking maybe a traveling ship , so large its considered a type of planet. Maybe, multi dimensional. You would get more truth out of the annunaki tablets than any modern day religion by far.

Is it nomnative determinism that makes all people with names like zecharia, obadiah etc into crazies? or do they change their names when they turn the corner?

www.SitchinIsWrong.comEnd of discussion.I can't believe there is actually a thread here on this nonsense - hasn't anybody even bothered to check this guy out?.. What I really wanna talk about is the first link in the list of round tables - the Archon nonsense, presumably written by the exact same people who hired Sitchin. You are currently living in virtual reality, or more precisely a consciousness-created construct. The Hindus call it "Maya." When the Bible tells you that the real world is Heaven, which I hope is obvious - again it's telling you that where you are now is all a test.There ARE no Archons - or, more accurately, YOU are the "Archons."You were created "In The Image Of God," meaning given the power to Create Reality.This is why so much effort is expended to fill you with fear, lust and greed - so that you generate negative reality.You have to realize that you are far more powerful than the people doing this to you. YOU are connected to God's Creative Force - YOUR power is INFINITE. THEY do not have it - which is why they have to resort to rituals and so forth.They fear the day you find out all this.I guess that day is now. :)By the way, you are now concluding Day 26 of the collapse of evil worldwide.More will be happening shortly. The entire worldwide system of evil is three weeks into total, irreversible collapse. Free fall. God has taken over. On October 13th.Edit: In case it wasn't obvious, Nag Hammadi / Gnostic Gospels are fake.Edit 2: You were brainwashed for decades against the number 13 because they knew it was coming. It is not a negative number. Jesus + Apostles = 13. Numerical value of Love, in Hebrew = 13. Oneness = 13. Name of God: YHVH = 26 (Love + Oneness). :)FOCUS ON WHO CREATED YOUR *SOUL*!!!

Nothing to add but MY IMMENSE LOVE FOR THIS TOPIC! Fuck the annunaki but also ... FucK the annunaki ;3 ... f'ya kno what'm sayin

I highly suggest the Earth Chronicles by Zecharia Sitchin.  It's a great alternative source that can be used to compare to other sources.  At the end of each Earth Chronicle book he comes to some fantastic conclusions.In the first book, the 12th Planet, he posits that their is a binary star in our system on a huge elliptical orbit.  Those from this planet have enslaved and altered us for their mining operations.  All fascinating stuff that he goes into great detail.  In the second book, Stairway to Heaven, he discusses the story of Gilgamesh.  How he believes he is part divine (alien) and wishes to return to the stars where they originate.  It's a story about how Enkidu (an AI/Robot) and Gilgamesh make their way to a rocket ship and try to leave Earth.Wars of Gods and Men details many of the battles that took place between humans and their slavers.  It goes into the drama between Marduk, Thoth, Enki and Enlil.  Their lineages and the actions they took.The Lost Realms is fantastic.  Sitchin says that Thoth left Egypt and came to start the Meso and South American Civilizations.  Talks about the pyramids, alignments and their mythologies.  He also lines up at the end of the book how there are two myths discussing the same event from two sides of the planet.  In the Bible it is said there are 22 hours of day and in the Americas, it was night for 22 hours.  He tries to pinpoint when this occurred and if it had anything to do with Niburu swinging by.So many more book in the series and so much more depth.  It's a fantastic read and actually is where I started in my journey.  I was trying to world-build a game/story and here I am almost twenty years later deep in the hole.

Nice, there is a lot of info (theories) in here (about niibiru and enki/enlil) and im sure some of it is true but just how much is there disinformation about this and why ? Is there a bigger secret behind all of this... i wonder what could it be.

Chemtrails and "geoengineering" being used to hide the Nibiru passage?Tsk, tsk!  What do our dear leaders have planned for us plebs??

Hey can you guys take my survey regarding conspiracy theories please for a projecthttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftGlmzwzc5MsZetkuE7FVxVziRsKqhBe0LPLUwsJ8FReMTqQ/viewform

We were altered from fish state. We have more similarities to fish than other mammals. 

Sitchin.... freemason disinfo agent? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wWxqXashBo

Have you looked into the book of Enoch? It describes the elohim/annunaki as fallen angels and deterred the ancient isrielites from worshipping these elohim. Mesopotamia literature presented the elohim as good guys but the book of Enoch presents them as bad. There is a great book by Dr Michael Heiser called the unseen realm that goes into great detail about this stuff, very interesting read. He is a Christian tho so if ur adamantly opposed to that stuff it might be a difficult read. 

Ancient culture of Lepenski vir, on Balkan, also had these fish humanoids as their gods.  [The most famous sculpture](http://www.narodnimuzej.rs/images/Skulptura-Praroditeljka.jpg)

Dr. Michael Heiser (Ph.D. Hebrew & Semitic Languages) who has his own unorthodox views on Scripture doesn't seem to think to highly of Mauro Biglino's translation skills. http://michaelsheiser.com/PaleoBabble/zecharia-sitchin-archive/comment-page-1/

Wow you and the second highest comment have a looot of similar details to your stories. I think we're getting somewhere with this.

"Anyhow, in the 1930s some anthropologists visited them and asked some questions, they got on the topic of astrology and were astounded at some of the things they heard. The dogon told the anthropologists about the Sirius cluster back when we thought it was just one star - - -"If I understand this part right, you suggest the modern science did not know about the cluster - or Sirius B - prior to 30's.Afaik: Sirius B's existence was anticipated by calculation 1844 (F. Bessel) and it was visually observed first time in 1863 (Alvan Clark). Thirty years later, in 1893, a group of French astronomers visited Dogon areas in Mali during their solar eclipse expedition that lasted more than a month."1930's some anthropologists" refer to works of Griaule and Dieterlen, who've seem to been unaware of the earlier expedition. In a oral culture of the Dogon, there have been 40-50 years of time to pass any information they possibly got from expedition team to next Dogon generations. Including, at the time, the latest astronomical information about the double nature of Sirius. IMHO: No doubt astronomy and Sirius were important for the Dogon culture. Perhaps because of this news of Sirius were welcomed and eagerly shared forward during the decades before Griaule and Dieterlen visits.In 1970's Griaule's and Dieterlen's works were re-popularized by Robert K. G. Temple who expressed the actual and initial claim about the extra-terrestial aspect. Something Griaule, nor Dieterlen never mentioned.Later there have been discussions about possible confusion Griaule and Dieterlen may have had, mainly concerning what actual stars the Dogon were referring to, Sirius or Venus or what. It is proposed that the oral heritage varies even amongst the Dogon people themselves.I did not write this in order to disturb your interesting discussion. Just wanted to enlighten the subject with another, perhaps more plausible, point of view. Hopefully you may build up a better theory on updated facts, something Temple so far never managed to do.

What if finding nemo was more than a kids movie? Ha. 

sacred symbols of the dogon is a great read, basically it describes how egyptian hieroglyphs contain references to string theory (dogon written language is similar to egyptian, but the difference is that the dogon still have an oral tradition whereby the esoteric meanings of the glyphs are explained, giving us insight into the deeper meaning of egyptian texts).

 

Great post. [Here's a link](http://www.mindofthemachine.com/downloads/MauroBiglino_Book.pdf) to one of Biglino's books translated into English if anyone is interested in reading. In it he translates the original Hebrew text literally into English, free of dogmatic or symbolic interpretations, which yields some very interesting results.

Amazing post, it was not poorly put together at all.  This post, what you conveyed, is the reason I come to this sub.I would gild you, if I was into paying this site.

 

Amazed this isn't more widely known, known about this for a very long time. Guess that just shows how well information is controlled

All of those bullet points can be countered by understanding orbits. It is absolutely impossible for a planet to orbit the Sun in such  way that we can't see and be on a collision course with us. ?NASA going from 'Planet X is bullshit' -> 'There might be a planet x' -> `There is a planet x we just don't know where it is yet' - > 'Our sun might have a binary twin'.This is just bullshit. NASA has not claimed anything remotely like this, except the first statement. Keep in mind that this does not take into account that we can infer the existence of celestial bodies from their gravitational effects and nothing makes us think Planet X exists. This theory is about as mathematically sound as the Earth being flat. Grouping this "conspiracy" with the real deal only hurts the movement. That's why we should shy away from it. "The CIA is doing stuff behind our back" - good conspiracy. "A planet we never saw will hit us and destroy all civilisation" - bad conspiracy. Lastly, even if the planet exists, there is nothing we can do to prevent the end of the Earth. There is no need to panic now, when we can panic when we will actually see Planet X with our naked eye. 

There is no threat, only from humans and those listening to negative entities. But overall what you listed was accurate. 

Well said

>Compelling evidence from whistle-blowers and investigators that billions have been spent over the last few decades building underground bases/cities in the USA and all over the world.Got some sauce?

> Van Flandern traced back the paths of scores of comets and found they converged at that location roughly 2 million years ago.That's very interesting. Do you have links to anything discussing this? The wikipedia article is quite sparse.

The electric universe proponents have this idea that protosaturn was a red dwarf in which the earth inhabited within the plasma atmosphere, until the planets were captured by our current sun, throwing the solar system into chaos. You should check out thunderbolts.info for more. They have a lot of scientific research and theory on YouTube and hold conventions yearly.

I always thought that saturn and Jupiter were planets ravaged by war. Saturn hit Jupiter with a weapon that drove deep into Jupiter's core, creating what we know as red eye and destroying all life on the planet at the same time by making the atmosphere unlivable. Jupiter on the other hand retaliated by hitting saturn with a weapon that vaporized its surface and unstablized it's gravity. This lead to debris floating out into orbit and forming the rings we see today.

Yeah these are fascinating. What's the book series by one of the original researchers? There is a couple books but one is planet nibiru or planet x I think.... 

> As for how the planet "exploded", that's a whole different matter...Too advanced too aggressive, I guess someone decided to cleanse the galaxy. Typical universe story. 

Seriously??!!! How did he trace them back 2 million years? . And in space? Absolute codswallop 

> The idea is there used to be a Saturn-sized oceanic planet between Jupiter and Mars (Tiamat) and it was destroyed in a cosmic battle, leaving behind the asteroid belt, cometsYep. Maldek. The destruction of that planet also caused the downfall of Mars which had it's own civilization at the time. 

Some researchers have suggested that the "monsters" depicted in ancient Sumer (and elsewhere) where actually genetic hybrids created during these experiments.The modern "pig" is also said to be created from combining wild boar and human DNA.

Side Question:There needs to be a distinction between interbreeding and genetic manipulation.By definition if two creatures can interbreed and have a viable offspring (which is not sterile i.e. mule) they are technically the same species. The term "extraterrestrial" means not of this earth, not necessarily alien. So in theory there could be humans who live their entire lives on other worlds. In this scenario the only leg up they ever had on us was knowledge / technology.Alternately if we could suppose that these "creators" were non human and used something more advanced than their cock & balls to genetically engineer humans. Then there is the added twist of not only engineering humans, but imbuing the humans with part of their own DNA spawning a new race like the The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Although this hybrid theory opens up another never ending blood chauvinism where people compete for who has the most dragon blood or wtvr.

The Pye video is *required*. Also it's fun to watch. The joke about Tyson is great.  A pity his book isn't in print.

Ok so what ive been thinking through my research is we were created by a species and then visited numerous times afterwards by other species that had a hand in altering our DNA at different points in our history. Which would explain the periods of rapid brain growth in humans over different periods of time. Also what do you think about hollow earth theory and how the elites tie back to our alien origins? Idk I feel there is a possibility they are hiding in plain sight or maybe right under our noses. Or the theory that over time they had to interbreed with humans and maybe the annunaki at present are a shadow of their former strength idk you seem to know alot and id love to bounce some questions off ya

Are you talking about the elongated ancient Egyptian skulls? I just saw something showing how it was trendy to band skulls from birth to give them that shape. 

Thanks for the awesome link collection. Currently working my way through all of it.Can you elaborate a little bit ob the fused chromosome 2 aspect? The wiki page seems to be broken at the moment and I couldn¬¥t find anything interesting so far. 

Epic of Gilgameshhttps://archive.org/stream/TheEpicofGilgamesh_201606/eog_djvu.txt

You link to chromosome 2 doesn‚Äôt work

Username spot on

http://saturniancosmology.org/Here is a reading about Saturn being closer to earth.

Worlds in Collision by Immanuel Velikovsky. Best place to start :). 

May explain all the missing gold at Fort Knox

Nope. Fake. 

That blog was a very interesting read! It's nuggets like that one that keep me wading through the sewer that is this sub :). Thanks man! 

 

Well that blog is a hell of a rabbit hole. I read the first ~70% of it including many comments (which I advise anyone considering to read it to check out, because they contain more writings from the author than the actual blog posts). I can't help but notice that he contradicts himself on something so fundamental that it discredits his entire story. So I find it hard to believe. Very interesting and enlightening nonetheless. He is either the GOAT whistleblower or a brutally sophisticated larper (or maybe just batshit crazy). 

Are Draco's Reptilians?

Great post. Filled in some holes, now it's much clearer. 

Is this the same guy that posted on ATS for a few days a handful of years ago? It sounds like him, I'll dig into the blog now.

IÔ∏èm with you IÔ∏è love reading about this stuff. Happen to have any links to similar threads you‚Äôve enjoyed?

 

Okay I‚Äôm pretty deep reading this, does it ever change from him just talking about how much he hates Obama?

Glad someone said it. All this hype about aliens and technology is right on the tracks of The Great Deception. God bless!

I'm happy to find a counter argument but the few examples I've looked at on this site don't seem to properly refute Sitchin with any demonstrable authority.How do we know who's translation/interpretation is correct without being an expert in ancient languages?

I feel like Mulder now from the X-files.

Yeah sitchin isnt correct but neither is the todays interpretation of the bible

"Are"

Correct. So was Anu, their commander. 

>Is it so hard to see that the entire UFO agenda and alien origins of man are Hollywood driven?Well, it's not that simple. Hollywood places real things or concepts into it's movies and disguises it as entertainment. On some level, they are trying to get people to think that alien origins are fantasy (by associating it with entertainment 1st and foremost). Alien origins are real but good luck piecing the story together. Most people are not capable of this.

THANK YOU! This really needed to be said. There are so many out there running around with false information and false beliefs due to questionable sources. Even the Annunaki themselves debunked Sitchin. &nbsp;The Gnostic stuff is pure garbage and I've seen how it's affected people. People love following and believing in fantasies because it's something for them to fight against. 

>We were altered from fish state.We evolved from the fish state. Ancestor of humans were 3-4ft tall and lived either on the coast or in the water near the coast.

Definitely not adamantly opposed, I'm spiritual in my own way. But yeah ive seen the book of Enoch, there were other books removed from the bible by the Vatican. There is an overwhelming sense of manipulation, especially apparent when looking at how much the catholic church has to spend on lawyers to defend the pedos also ill definitely look into that book!

Definitely Check out Chuck Missler.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Itl5ChyCs

Enoch also describes a blackhole. ü§î

Reminds me of the phillistine fish like god Dagon. Also Manu from Hinduism.

The Starbucks logo originally depicted Melusine, a sort of mermaid. The twin-tailed goddess.

Interesting find man! At some point things stop being a coincidence ya know?

That would make sense seeing as how mauro translates pre Hebrew texts, because as he explains, most of the important events of the old testament occurred before Hebrew existed as a language. For example, Moses did not speak Hebrew because it did not exist at the time.

Zecheria Sitchin was into the occult.Have you guys seen this video concerning the validity of the Hyperlinked nature of the Bible and it's uncanny ability to predict world events hundreds of years in advance, including the birth, entry and death of Christ?Even though it was written over a period of 1500 years by over 40 people?Maybe we should pay attention to what it says...CHUCK MISSLER: Extra-Terrestrial Messagehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPQ1dGQTrzA

Just noticed that myself lol, this is the theory that has been interesting me the most. And I think you're right there's something here

Lol or little mermaid

Some historians believe that the hieroglyphs are more metaphorical than straight up this and that.  For example a relief of the pharaoh catching birds with a net could be translated into the pharaoh catching his errant thoughts (bird's representing thoughtforms).  Hieroglyphics are far more complicated than most think.

Nice explanation my friend!

Just edited the link into my post, super interesting to watch! And you can tell he knows exactly what he's talking about

Thanks I appreciate it! Dont worry ill gladly take the compliment as a substitute

Yeah, true or not there is something to these nummo myths and ancient translations of texts. Like I said we won't know until we know, but I personally believe whatever we learn, humans have had a long interesting relationship with probably multiple different alien species and were most likely seeded on Earth by a race much more advanced then ours. It sure will be exciting to see what unfolds in this age of Aquarius! 

If you find this interesting watch this:https://youtu.be/x5izTVpwdwQThat is one of my all time favorites to watch. Clif High is an amazing person and has many opinions that have completely broadened my perspective

>This is just bullshit. NASA has not claimed anything remotely like thishttps://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/planetxOops. 

Dude your adgenda is showing. Science might be wrong does not equal 'the earth is flat'. 

All hail NASA ..

Do you at all know what you're talking about?  Have you seriously never heard of a highly eccentric Kepler orbit?  Do you understand how comets work and why we only see them on specific time intervals?Do you seriously not read the news and see NASA saying there are gravity signatures of a large celestial object much larger than earth located outside of our solar system?You don't even seem to understand the basis of the stories of antiquity he mentions.  Show me where they state that it actually collides with earth every X amount of years. They infer that it passes near us every X amount of years and that it's presence sparks geological events (ie; earthquakes, impact events caused by asteroids that pass through with it, etc....or in the Sumerian's case; visitation from the Annunaki)

NASA employee by any chance? 

I got that from his book, *Dark Matter, Exploding Planets & New Comets*...he completely revolutionizes our approach/understanding of gravity.It's an incredible book!

Seconding this.http://saturniancosmology.org/tung.php

The 12th planet by Sitchin?

Van Flandern was a highly respected astronomer, and numerous discoveries are credited to him.What gives you the authority to be so dismissive of his work?

That's interesting I wonder if that's why not eating pork seems to be big in religion?

I‚Äôve also heard the pig thing. Which is alluded to when Christ sends the legion of demons into the pigs. 

[The Hybrid Hypothesis Eugene McCarthey](http://www.macroevolution.net/human-origins.html)

I'm in a place where rodeo and 4H are still active, and I know lots of farmers who would laugh at that pig statement.But my perspective on human DNA manipulation after diving into this stuff for the last 20 years, and interest for ~30, leans more to stoned ape theory than this, though I like to read up on it. My personal feeling after spiritual exploration and psychonautic experimentation is that there are primal metaphors in all this Archon stuff that deal mainly in the inner struggle, metaphorically our "rise from the mud" or our exit from the cave. Celestial Mythos and the ever-expanding history of humans, Oannes and the Apkallu brotherhood spreading knowledge gathered over millennia by different groups - all that, and what we'll continue to find actual evidence of is where I place my "faith."

A bit late, but I wonder if dolphins/whales are some sort of genetic hybrid

According to what I‚Äôve read it was both. Humans were first created from alien/primate gene splicing. We were created sterile but were given the ability to procreate some time later. *Side note: this is an alternative translation to original sin in the bible where Enki allowed for humans to breed when it was forbidden.*Once established as a species, the Annunaki took our women as mates creating a second new species, or supposedly the Nephalim.

I don‚Äôt know anything about hollow earth, however Phillip Schneider claimed we have an existing subterranean alien species living here now in the Tall Greys. I don‚Äôt know how much credence should be given there though. I think he was debunked as a liar. There are stories of Annunaki-human breeding though. Forgive me the source right now (probably somewhere in Sitchen‚Äôs writings), but the idea is supposed that Annunaki became attracted to our females, developed relationships, and bred with them. This is where the Nephalim supposedly came from.  It even goes as far as claim that upon departure of earth humans were supposed to be eradicated with a great flood but an argument ensued and, with Enki as our greatest advocate, it was agreed to leave us alive.

The question would be 'why was it trendy' it could have been merely aesthetic with no other motive like chinese foot binding or it could have been a status thing based on an already existent class of people who had such a shape naturally. We know in more down to earth(heh) scenarios people absolutely do go to great lengths to alter their bodies and those of their children to more closely resemble more high status and powerful people in society. ie. the complicated history of hair straightening in the african american community and skin whitening in societies that came under colonial rule by white europoeans. I'm sure there are many other cases of people modifying their bodies to look more like colonizers or rulers for various reasons. 

The Peruvian elongated skulls have a larger cranial volume than we modern humans do as well as a different dental formulation from us, which are supposedly unique to each species. I'm on the trolley right now so i have no web, but i'll post links later.

All other primates have 24 pairs of chromosomes except for humans which have 23. Our chromosome 2 is a much larger, fused chromosome of two others which contains 242 million base pairs and 8% of our total DNA. It‚Äôs argued that the fusing of chromosomes cannot occur naturally, and is an act of intelligent intervention. There‚Äôs a lot of debate about this though and it‚Äôs pretty complex. You basically need to be a geneticist to really understand it. I do my best to read both sides of the discussion but admittedly, I‚Äôm way out of my depth when I start reading about telomeres and gene sequencing etc. 

Enuma Elishhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/enuma.htm

It‚Äôs just Wikipedia, man. Search, ‚ÄúChromosome-2‚Äù. 

Ditto! So glad I could give one back to the community.  

Actually, the situation has changed recently.Here is a post I made once in response to a question asking why all the pedo stuff is coming out now.  It explains some and link at the end for more.Tl:dr: Draco gone now, only Illuminati left, and they are fighting each other.A couple years ago the Draco empire left. They were running the shit and had many projects and programs setup to generate certain powerful human emotions because they used the energy it produced.Since they left many of those projects and programs shut down because there was no need for them anymore. This doesn't mean it has stopped, just lessened. But as a result, more and more of it is getting exposed. Its more complicated than just that, but you get the general idea.(Asked to elaborate...)Apparently, the Draco built the control system on this planet. The human elements of the structure is what we'd call the Illuminati or such. They're the minions that do the bidding, but it was always the Draco calling the shots.When the empire left, they handed over control to the Illuminati, who immediately began fighting each other in the power vacuum. You can see this playing out today with all the different factions of the Cabal fighting and exposing each other.So, they were harvesting our energy. The Illuminati were very much caught up in all that, but not so much getting the same benefits the Draco were. So when the empire left, there wasn't as much a need for it all. I don't think I need to describe it all, we're all very familiar with the sick shit that's been going on. So with those types of programs dissolving, the truth of what's been happening has started being used against certain factions. Also people trapped in that crap are more free now to come out than before.There's also another layer in between that really strange. They're called the parents, and they were the interface between the Draco and the Illuminati. They are mostly gone now too, but still a problem for us.I just posted a nice write up that describes more of what we can expect. Check it if you're interested. Feel free to ask questions.https://www.reddit.com/r/greenlight/comments/7a6kji/the_plan_the_path_of_discoveries_the_change/

So glad you're enjoying it.  I think it's by far the greatest rabbit hole out there.  The kinda thing that can affect your view on all the other rabbit holes.I've read it several times over the years and always find more connections and understanding of references or concepts I didn't get before.  Good stuff.Can I ask what the contradition is you see?  So few have read the blog it's hard to find people to talk with about it :)

Yes. But apparently not all reptilians are Draco though. I use to think the names were interchangeable but I guess its more nuanced.

No, not the same.  And this is a different perspective and concept all together.  He's not trying to disclose things to people like us, he's answering questions from people on the inside.Hope you find what you're looking for :)

I'm ignorant of those.  How do these dots connect?

Check out the nag hammadi codices.  They contain the apocrypha (books removed from the bible) and more.. Including fantastic works like the hypostasis of the Archons and on the origins of the world.  These are the texts of the Gnostics who as previously mentioned believe Yahweh to be a counterfeit mimic of a God.  Check out "not in his inage" as well.. A wonderful write up on the Gnostics and their history.

Yeah, im not religious myself, but like you said im in touch with the spiritual side of things...The gnostic gospels from the Nag Hammadi library that were discovered this past century are another good example of religious texts that were censored. The Gospel of St Thomas is a really good one

It just means when they landed in the ocean they stayed there, and created a city. I don't believe they are fish gods. They wear fish like armor, or clothes, but not actually fish people. The annunaki look like much larger versions of you, and I.

Your view of Moses is incorrect friend.  And I'm not sure how his earlier language experience would be an excuse for errors regarding Hebrew texts...

Is prophecy being fulfilled, or are powerful men manipulating world events to make it appear so? I think the later. The Templar sect in the masons are manufacturing the end of the world. Will you accept this end as god's return, (nothing we can do about it), or  not fall for it ( and do something about it). 

You read the ruiner blog?  Interesting if nothing else

There was a Star Trek, next generation like that.  They met a race that spoke in metaphors.  It was a weird one at first, but a brilliant one with multiple views.Battle of Tanagra.  When the towers fell.  Wow, it's been ages.

 

Awesome! Always looking for new stuff, thanks!

 

What is the Planet X conspiracy though? I thought it was something about it crashing into us in 2012. Do you guys believe the one NASA wrote about will crash into us? 

Science being a cover-up might though..... 

True, but it might be!

NEVERACTUALLYSAYSANYTHING

>he completely revolutionizes our approach/understanding of gravity.Could you do a small summary? There are two leading theories in how gravity works and I haven't heard of a third one and would like to hear about it. 

Yup nailed it. You read them all?

Well if you read what I wrote you will know

Interesting dot connection.  Pigs are hella smart and have advanced emotional IQ.

This is a great question.

I believe [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysticercosis) is why.

Crikey. Years without sex!!! :) 

Awesome, thanks for the info. I definitely think there's much more to this than meets the eye. Its like religion is made up of many half truths due to the masorets controlling the interpretation of the bible

You were right though, it can weigh pretty heavily. The claim the Ra material was another manipulation is probably the hardest thing for me to digest. Ive put a lot of stock in that one, I just don't see how any negative spin could outweigh the benefits that the Ra materials provides people with. I am also curious to see why the guy, and a few others, have a beef with the New Age movement, more specifically what they think it is doing to continue to illusion. It's a shame it was written a few years ago. On that note the odd predictions the guy made about 'the wave' haven't seemed to pan out with drops its credibility a bit.

Well one minor discrepency is when he talks about his background. He says he told his parent's about his "summer programming" at "his aunt's" house. They respond by accusing him of lying and saying he drove his aunt insane. His mother is a supposed ex-member of the 13 bloodlines. She is obviously in the know. Why would she treat him that way?The big contradiction though is when he talks about the universal law of free will (or whatever he calls it). The Draco's are not violating it because they recieved permission from earlier generations of mankind and also are informing us (subliminally?) about their plans through various means. Our passivity supposedely indicates consent. > Unfortunately no one besides us have the right to stop them.  Their violations of free will and natural laws are handled by the universe not a galactic police force or legal system.  In those courts what they are doing with this planet would be considered frowned upon but still technically legal.So they are supposedly not violating our free will. But he says one (or more) of the life extension methods used by the parent's involves babies. He doesn't state what they do with them but one would assume they are taking their blood and/or harvesting energy from them. Whatever they do to the babies I can't imagine how a baby could consent to this. Passivity doesn't really indicate consent when it comes to babies.  In fact it's reasonable to say that if a baby starts to cry when you do your business with it, that would mean you are violating its free will. It has no other way to communicate its unwillingness to participate.He also says he was offered a job to telepathically influence people's actions. How is that not a violation of free will?How is MK Ultra mind control programs not a violation of free will? Even if consent is given at the beginning of the process, one would imagine that intense torture would cause the affected person to beg for it to stop. At which point free will is violated if the torture is continued.Also I don't see how one being could give consent for the actions performed against another, even if our social and legal norms tell us that's the case (e.g. parents, ancestors, legal guardians). I'm sure there are more discrepencies regarding free will (and perhaps regarding other things as well) but none come to mind right now . I would have to give the material a second reading. Perhaps my understanding of the actual mechanics of free will is just flawed but I can't see how any of these things don't violate free will.

Demons ? 

Hmmm interesting.  I guess like Humanoid, Reptoid or Reptilian can just be another category that extends throughout different civilizations that isn't limited to one specific one.

Wonderfully, actually...It's a little hard to explain - I've found my research synchronicities point in this direction... not to say that ALL Egyptians, Canaanites, Basque, etc were aliens/survivors. Just the leaders who raised them out of the darkness, so to speak.Truly it looks like a sea-faring network of cities world wide collapsed in a flood and those less civilized or uncontacted peoples before who lost everything and were forced inland, made these more advanced people (giants?) their first kings and gods... but it's literally always those same civilizations and peoples coming up...

I'll second the Pnutmaster comment.  Basque, Berbers, and Gaels are Atlantean refugees.  Blond/Red -haired, fair skinned, blue eyes and using a language that has no Indo-Euro roots.Wondering the connection between Tuatha De Danann and the Gaels.Interesting the presence of "Dan" in that word (Lost tribe of Dan).

Nag hammadi was what I was going to suggest 

Ive heard of the Gnostic gospels before but ill have to look into them much deeper now, thanks for the further reading material!

My theory is the nummo and the annunaki are different species that visited us at different times

It's kind of like not having punctuation, you can read what it says, but there is no possible way to know exactly what happened without that punctuation.When you translate between twoblanguages, there are sometimes words that don't directly translate. Germans might have one word to convey an aversion to socialization, where as in english, it would be the name of some behavioral disorder. It would also convey a label, rather than a meaning.Language is pretty cool, and incredibly complex when you start moving between them.

"To do this justice, we have to understand that the Hebrew language was passed on as cononants, and they have no idea what vowels were inserted.Vowels are the meaning. They give meaning to the sentence, paragraph, and in order to know this Hebrew would have had to exist at the time.¬†At the time of Moses, Hebrew did not exist as a language and all scholars/academics know that.¬†So, the bible is not an accurate thing, but is actually someone's opinion. The opinion of a certain powerful family took precedence over everyone else's. Of course that family was located in the Holy Land because coordination was going to have to take place between religions to some extent.There are words where up to 70 meanings could be ascertained depending on the vowels."

God Uses Men for his ends like he did Cyrus, Nebuchanezzar, Hitler.Also, Ezekiel 38 has yet to happen, and while Damascus is a ruinous heap, looks to me like it hasn't become "desolate" yet.

Can't say I have, ill have to look it up when I get home

Absolutely stunning episode, I remember it vividly.  Shaka, when the walls fell.

No problem! Just a rabbit hole I got really sucked into recently lol

It's kind of both. Astronomers around the world keep finding evidence of another planetary body that interacts with our solar system, even NASA admits it's there. The conspiracy part comes into it because the more you read into our ancient history, the more indications there are that periodically our planet is affected by other celestial bodies to a cataclysmic degree. This knowledge is hidden from people for the reason of various adgendas. As a side note, it may not hit us but the magnetic effects of celestial bodies passing close to one another means huge geological turmoil on the surface of our world. 

Google chemtrails and Nibiru.Do you really think they would tell us??Not until the wealthy and powerful are safely hidden in their doomsday bunkers!  Why would they tell us?  They would rather cover our planet with "clouds" and fog until the last possible minute....

>  Do you guys believe the one NASA wrote about will crash into us?There are no "you guys". Just a bunch of randos like you and me alongside several hundred bots. 

Wasn't it the sumerians that wrote that the planet is full of creatures that come to harvest humans when the planet comes near?  A culling would reset the world, giving it 10000 years to build up again for the next orbit.

Just heard of this, but I guess it stands to reason a big enough planet with an orbit like that could bring some dangerous friends along for the journey 

NEVER A STRAIGHT ANSWER!

2 main theories of gravity:  1) Masses exert a pulling force on other masses and move toward each because of this force (Newton)  2) Masses exert a "deforming" force on spacetime and other masses are caused to move by this deformed spacetime (Einstein)

Nope...on the fence about Sitchin personally, but I do appreciate his work and how it's fueled great discussions like this.If you want a more scientific approach to this topic, I highly recommend *Dark Matter, Missing Planets & New Comets* by astronomer Tom Van Flandern.Fascinating stuff!

If you figure out the vectors and momentum of an object in a frictionless environment, you can quite easily project where its heading and also reverse the clock to see where it's been. Rewind 2 million years and they end up in the same spot. Strange?What's hard about that to understand? 

> Pigs are hella smart and have advanced emotional IQ.That explains my ex.

I think so. I think the modern religions are books translated from cruciform and Hebrew, which were translated from Aramaic, which were translated from the first stone carvings, which told the story of aliens landing on earth and creating mankind. The repeated misinterpretation has lead us to a story of ‚Äúa god in heaven‚Äù when it‚Äôs original meaning was probably something like, ‚Äúvisitors from the stars‚Äù. The best example of this that I can give is how Sumerians depicted gods. Their symbol for gods (plural) was that of a flying, hovering thing, similar to a gliding bird which flew but did so specifically without flapping it‚Äôs wings. This was interpreted in Hebrew as the word ‚Äúspirits‚Äù, which we translate today as the word ‚Äúgod‚Äù (singular). Hovering, flying thing = Spirits = God (or some variation of that). I must stress, I‚Äôm no expert and I have no source on this. These are just my personal thoughts. 

>I definitely think there's much more to this than meets the eye. Its like religion is made up of many half truths due to the masorets controlling the interpretation of the bibleLet me know what you think about these 2 videos. Both nice and short enough. I think you'll enjoy!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHiad18ZwcYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oja3uz51k9I

Yeah, I hear ya.  He had a good quote once in an interview where he said, "The truth shall set you free, but first it'll piss you off."It is quite the rollercoaster. In regards to all our materials being corrupted, he's made the remarks more than once about not throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  He understands well that its difficult to come to grips and made sure to emphasis that lots of truth is still in those materials.  Focus more on the concepts and less on the details, that's where they mostly muddy the waters.  I don't know the Ra material other than the lectures I've heard or stuff from Wilcock, so I can't comment much about it.  Just be wary of any parts that have you giving you power to someone else or putting others above you.  Mostly they would twist things in way where you end up relying too much on another authority or getting constricted into closing out other ideas or beliefs.Which is mostly where concerns about the new age stuff come in.   It can be trouble if people are waiting for some higher power, aliens, or spirit, or whatevs to change things or fix things for them.  The new age type stuff where arch Angeles are coming "soon" to enlighten us or ascend us or were gonna go to 5d, just you wait, no need to do anything, just wait.  I know that's a terrible generalization, but you get the idea.Funny, kinda sounds like his "wave" talk.Although, I do wonder a lot if all the craziness happening in the world now has to do with it. I don't know, but I think about it a lot.Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts.  Its great to have others to discuss this with.

Ingesting the babies blood in order to revitalise your body and organs. 

So, I'd like to add a piece to the 'free will pie'  as it were. There's the idea that, there exist multiple levels of reality above us and that there's actually an elaborate pre-incarnation process that goes on before a soul actually ends up incarnated. This is where the really nasty alleged free will twist is said to happen and actually, if even remotely true, gives us the association of devils with contracts and even the very concept of souls being stolen.Basically, the idea would be that in order to incarnate on a planet you have to make an agreement with whoever rules that planet on the level that oversees such decisions. The entities in charge of earth, being general assholes have a particularly nasty setup in the contracts they require of souls that want to drop in and spend some time on our lovely sphere. The biggest one, however is the one having to do with memory. Basically, everyone or almost everyone 'agrees' prior to reincarnation to have their memory wiped and lose all knowledge of all prior existence or history and conscious knowledge of any pre-existing agreements that have been made this is coupled with a bunch of other agreements that involve 'agreeing' to being subject to the risk of free will violations while physically incarnated. So, that right there allows a tremendous amount of leeway with what's done to people down on the surface because they 'agreed' to a whole bunch of ball and chain clauses that limit them without even knowing about it. 'The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he doesn't exist' if you will. Allegedly, that by itself isn't really enough to for some of the nastier free will violations, but the next part involves tricking or convincing people to do things actually 'of their own free will' so that the authorities upstairs can point to those actions in order to get permission to do what would otherwise be 'against the law'. Then there's the really wild idea of soul capture following death. So everyone's memory is wiped prior to incarnation and then all their life they're indoctrinated and programmed into false belief systems, when they die they end up in a situation that most aren't prepared for and things show up and try to trick them into agreeing to things they really shouldn't be agreeing to. Apparently, there's a whole process for retrieving all past memories etc. and people get caught before they can do it, fed a bunch of bullshit about karmic debt etc. and convinced to agree to reincarnate with all that that entails. You end up with a weird recycling system where people aren't ever actually able to comprehend what's going on because they've been denied access to the full picture and an elaborate system of smoke and mirrors has been erected to trick them into agreeing to things they shouldn't agree to. Since this all technically started with free will agreements in the first place, the nasty tricks are allowed because the nasty tricks where agreed to at least in principle.Of course you also have weird ideas like people actually being multidimensional entities where parts of them exist outside of time as we understand it, so under that framework the person down here on earth or even a newly disincarnated soul might very well just be a tiny fraction of a larger personal structure that primarily exists outside of the weird shenanigans alleged to be going on down here on earth with earth as some sort of really really fucked up game that's a bit of a puzzle to resolve from the higher points of view, but a game none the less.

Well said my friend.  I think it would be great if all peoples and non-peoples read your statements about free will.I spent a lot of time pondering this concept too, not sure I understanding it any better yet. But my feelings on the matter are right in line with your comments. As for the author of the blog, Shane, he feels the same as you do.  That what the Draco were doing is a violation of free will, and in many ways, just like you pointed out. This is why he could never fit in with any of their programs and projects.  It's why he got moved around so much and was given the moniker "the ruiner".  His conscience always got in the way.  From what I've gathered listening to his interviews after, it seems nobody "out there" was really aware of the details.  The "legal" aspects of it were similar to how we have a House and Congress and Judicial system, but behind that is a sinister and hidden force always doing dirty deeds in the dark.It seems recently at lot more attention has been focused on our planet and I've heard him speculate with others that it might even be part of the reason the Draco left, because word was getting out of what they were really doing.As far a Shane's family, I also can't imagine his mother wouldn't understand what was happening.  Unless she really was that far removed from it all.  He said she was never brought into the folds of it all because of her rebellious and conscience spirit.But all the dirty details aside, thanks for your words here. I hope more read them because I feel its important we all hold a mirror up and try to deal with all aspects of ourselves, including how we perceive the concept of free will for ourselves and others.

In this context demons would be another entity all together.  Aliens being separate from demons. Although each may portray themselves as the other at times, so that complicates things.

Yup. And that actually seems perfectly logical :)

Woah! I'm basque! Do you have any links with more information on this??

Mauro himself claims it is just his theory, but what we do know is that we dont know

That's fucking amazing. I knew about the no vowel things but the way you put it into context makes me really think. I just figured scholar's had a special trick at deriving meaning, but they're mostly guessing. 

The bible is the retelling of the Greek myths. Hell=hades, Apollo=Lucifer, god=Zeus, moses=heremes, Hercules=Samson,  devil=typhon,  etc.

Which rich family are u speaking of?

 

I'm seeing some go on about literal demons and Satan lurking about in this world so I'm not sure if this place is a joke or not. Government conspiracy and coverups? Sure, I believe that. Lizard people/demons/planets crashing into us seems like too much. 

I've read Sitchin's work, but it's been a while...but basically that the highly eccentric kepler orbit of planet X allows them to visit earth on a time interval and that all sorts of shit has gone down when they do so.  They essentially had engineered/created humans as robots/slaves to mine for them at one point.The 'culling' i think is mostly tales of impact events and floods that coincide with planet X, which now mainstream science admits there is evidence of periodic flooding that triggers mini ice ages, likely from impact events.

The real reason for the second amendment! /s

Tbf I only had read a quarter of the 12th planet before someone stole it at a hostel. You might just have deterred me from reading the rest ahahaha What made you on the fence about him?

No. Just patently false. Can you prove it? No. Can you understand that? Probably no again

y i k e s

Completely agree man thanks for all the information, have you heard of mauro biglino? He says alot of the things youre talking about especially about the flying craft 

Damn! Just watched the first one about to start the other

I wonder how much the rest of the universe has to suck for anyone to ever agree to come to this shithole on those conditions.

Not everything is a trick. You're supposed to incarnate without any memory. That's what gives life meaning. The true trick is influencing the newly incarnated with making the wrong choices. That's why a lot of this revolves around the media, entertainment industry and so on. 

Truthfully, a lot of it relates to the proto-basque cultures and how they intertwine with similar civilzations around the same time.There has been a LOT of forgery regarding Proto-Basque digs... and just, the name shows up so often in my research but I haven't spent a lot of time on it yet. I should do that :\For example, I was going to not post this yet and went back to the article I was reading and came across this in it:"‚ÄúGenetic DNA analysis can trace the ethnic tribal lineage, and thereby land of the origin, of a human being.  Native American tribes contain four distinct DNA groupings, designated A, B, C and D. These groupings are found in Asia but not in Europe or Africa. While 96 percent of all indigenous natives in North and South America fall within A, B, C and D, there was a mysterious four percent, dubbed Group X, which could not be explained.‚ÄúType X subjects were not found in the vast majority of tribes, including none in South America. It was also determined Type X subjects arrived in North America 10,000 to 38,000 years ago, later than the other groups.  By far, the highest concentration of Type X in Europe was found in the Basques, a race of Caucasians who live in the Pyrenees Mountains between Spain and France. And the highest frequency of Type X in the entire world was found in the Berbers, a race of Caucasians who live in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco in North Africa.  The Basques and Berbers have long puzzled anthropologists, linguists and historians because they don‚Äôt seem to fit into their continental surroundings.nephilim3‚ÄúHowever, independent researchers of the Association of Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.), followers of Edgar Cayce, have come forward and made a few observations of their own.  Known as the Sleeping Prophet, Edgar Cayce (1877-1945) is considered by many to have been America‚Äôs foremost psychic. Throughout his lifetime he performed over 14,000 readings while in a self-induced trance. Although delving into many subjects, 8,976 of his readings, transcribed onto 900,000 pages of notes, were devoted to medical problems, a majority of which were resolved, often advancing current medical technology."http://enkispeaks.com/?p=17213Just follow the waves of the universe, that is how you hear the real God of all and thus, find truth.You just taught me as much as I taught you ;)

Just like everything else, haha.

Fair point.  One thing I have noticed, up here in Canada, is that the geoengineering sprays are usually deployed near cities, toward the sun, at sunrise and sunset.  Seems suspicious to me.  Why near cities, and why target the rising and setting sun?I believe 100% that chemtrails are to prevent us from seeing anomalies and thus our panic.  Also, the sun's azimuth has been off for years.  Sun rising and setting too far north or south.  They can't hide this with their silly sprays.  How classy of them.

> Lizard people/demons/planets crashing into us seems like too much.Welcome to the internet. How long have you been around?

tbh, it sounds far stretched, but not to crazy when you begin to read the bible and gnostic texts. I was never religious, but the more I read these old texts, I understand where all these theories are coming from that deal with the supernatural, aliens, lizards and soul trap things.

Don't wanna speak for peyotl but Sitchin is rumored to be an Illuminati type, sent as an "expert" to toss mis-information into the field, give the Official Translation of Sumerian Tablets and all that.I'm also on the fence.

No I haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôll check it out. Thanks. 

Basic idea is that it used to be a paradise and people came here all the time for tons of reasons, then new management took over and no one new came here except for the very stupid and the very brave. The few who managed to figure out a way to get out even from under the veil of ignorance probably weren't particularly keen on coming back given the risks.Supposedly, there are also people who come in given the risks because they're part of an effort to weaken the system and assist in changing management. Presumably, things like Bodhisattva would be the types of entities that would drop in despite circumstances.

I think you're right, but a. there's degrees of possible loss of memory. You can imagine a situation where the loss of memory is less profound than ours is and b. you can see how if such a process isn't explicitly put on lockdown to prevent meddling it could be hijacked. You can have a hypothetical situation where the re-incarnation rules are different for different domains and ruled by different interpretations of whatever universal law is the overriding determinant of what is and isn't allowable. that we're stuck down here in ignorance makes us easy pickings for anyone who knows more of the big picture than us and is interested in hindering the rate at which we discover it either way.Also, there's like a thousand narratives and counter narratives so I was just sharing one wild one I'm fond of because it makes things even weirder than the trite we incarnate here because we want to be here one, which is technically true if free will is a thing, but figuring out how free will could be twisted into something decidedly un-free is an interesting thought experiment, at least for me.

So you mean reading religious text lends credibility to these theories? Or just understand where the mindset comes from? Where do these texts get their information from?

Really? Have anything to read on that subject?

So how exactly does hat the population has gone from 1 billion to almost 8 billion in ~130 years fit into this equation?

> So you mean reading religious text lends credibility to these theories?If the premise is "everything in the bible etc. is real, not fiction" then, yes! I'm still not religious and a believer, just to make that clear, my argument has nothing to do with my own beliefs.

Sitchin was taught by Jesuits

Humans aren't the only creatures with souls that can incarnate in human bodies.

"The Fellowship has been described as one of the most politically well-connected ministries in the United States. The Fellowship shuns publicity and its members share a vow of secrecy.[8] The Fellowship's leader Doug Coe and others have explained the organization's desire for secrecy by citing biblical admonitions against public displays of good works, insisting they would not be able to tackle diplomatically sensitive missions if they drew public attention."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_(Christian_organization)This group is the actual power in the Executive Branch right now, not Trump.  Understand "The Fellowship Foundation" and you will understand the current White House.  Some reading:[One of the earlier mainstream media investigative pieces on the group](http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/27/nation/na-prayer27)[An excerpt from Jeff Sharlet's book about the group's relationship with Somalian dictator, Siad Barre](http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/damnation/jesus-plus-nothing-minus-somalia/)[It's a bipartisan group, Hillary Clinton called the group's leader, Doug Coe, her spiritual mentor.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7eJvDNkGxM)There's more, but the media generally doesn't talk about the group outside of liberal media talking about Fellowship/Republican sex scandals.  Many members of the current Cabinet and cabinet level positions, and various appointed offices are members and allies of the group largely put in place by VP Mike Pence, [who is a member of the group.](https://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/21/jeff_sharlet_on_common_thread_between)I have been researching the group for years to make a graphic novel, I can answer some questions.  [Here's a test chapter](https://christincorporatedcomics.wordpress.com/) I made for the project.   

A meaningful and complete contribution to this subject will be tricky and long and there will (always be) naysayers and detractors, so let's dive right on in: (hmm, where to begin...)Let us take a look at the distribution of a [little possessed DNA grouping, called Haplogroup X](http://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Genetic-Map-of-Haplogroup-X.jpg). The Eastern Band of Cherokee have, for some time now, insisted upon Middle Eastern ancestry and though testing of THEIR people yielded low percentages, so did testing in the current middle east.It is as if, a sea-faring race of original Canaanites was in the Middle East prior to everyone else who lives there now and they came or moved to America and are now almost extinct... hmm... curious.[What do their legends tell us of their origins then?](http://www.native-languages.org/legends-giants.htm)... hmm I see... 23 tribes, some of the largest ones - all insist upon giants inhabiting this land before them... well that's okay, *pre-historic man was stupid, yep they were dumbbbbb...they thought the enemy was a cool guy so they painted petroglyphs of them as 15 feet tall and eating all their people. Yup.. they were dumb..*Or and lets be honest here... do you really think pre-historic man knew nothing of truth or importance and everything he told us of his life was a lie?So if we are WILLING to consider that there may be some veracity to these legends, let's look at the overall picture of what we find in America, to begin to build a case.Well, the most prominent and common feature we find are [hundreds and hundreds of burial mounds](https://tennesseearchaeologycouncil.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/mounds-map.jpg?w=680&h=485). Yet some of these mounds are too large for just burials - in the case of [Monk's Mound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monks_Mound) the base of the structure is almost equal to the footprint of the Great Pyramid. In the case of [Poverty Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_Point) we find a city built atop/between/around the mound site. (As an interesting note, that we will get to later: some of these burial mounds show intense weathering and deposition of sea-based minerals and markers. Some are also in the middle of rivers, swamps, lakes - remembering of course two things:1) Climate, geography and the shape of the land change over time2) Pre-historic people were NOT stupid. (I always ask people "Why build a sunken city... no one would do that in a time where very survival was your own responsibility... it SANK... people are SO brainwashed into non-rational thinking these days it's almost sickening.)These geological changes seem to imply a different landscape at the time of their building. Now some can be explained as plains that became swamps a few hundred or thousand years ago, fine.In the case of [Lovelock Cave's Duck Decoys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovelock_Cave#Duck_decoys), the last time the area had any meaningful body of water to fish from was [12,700 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lahontan). Not to mention they were dug from a strata of soil dating between 10,000 to 15,000 years. The Paiute natives of this area tell of their army chasing the last of the Giants into the cave, setting the entrance aflame and firing thousands of arrows into the cave. From the cave, beneath layers of bat guano were found burnt brush, many arrowheads and a strange donut shaped stone with 365 notches carved on the outside ring. Evidently an 8 foot 6 inch skeleton was found under the guano by the Paiutes but they buried it and refuse to reveal the location - because they claim the Giants are their ancestors!!!! Curiouser and curiouser. The reason for the war was apparently that after having taught the Paiute and protected them, they began to devour them? (World wide claims hold that there may have been two races of giants: red haired, friendly ones and black haired cannibalistic ones.) In prolonged sun exposure, very dark hair can attain a ruddy, rust colour. Perhaps they mistook one for the other and paid for it in blood?In an attempt to gain extra information from the Paiutes, (one researcher was extorted for at least four figures, just to film [Pyramid Lake](http://www.terragalleria.com/images/us-sw/usnv9112.jpeg). The Pyramid Lake [petroglyphs](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/photos/000/703/70378.jpg) were determined to be between 10,000 and 15,000 years old. It becomes slowly clear there is some kind of gate-keeping occurring here.Even the strict religion of science cannot fully accept the [Baring Strait Crossing Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_of_the_Americas), saying and I quote: >"There exists a number of theories for pre-Columbian trans-oceanic migrations into the Americas."To counter the scientific ineptitude of this theory, the [Kelp Crossing Hypothesis](https://www.inverse.com/article/38057-first-americans-kelp-highway-hypothesis) has been suggested. >"In the Perspective, Erlandson and his colleagues argue that early Americans followed Pacific Rim shorelines from northern Asia to Beringia to the Americas, then continued to migrate through the Americas along the coasts ‚Äî not through the ice-free corridor that the Clovis-first theory suggests."If you return to the map of the mounds, however and the distribution of Haplogroup X. **The conspiracy is: the wrong sea-board and the wrong people at the wrong time!**Though my explanation has been MUCH simplified (I could write DAYS worth of the evidence I have discovered and how it all webs together to support this, but no one wants that.) I believe the GENERAL idea is becoming clear.A respected red-haired race of stature, ORIGINALLY From the middle-east and nearly completely unrelated to those who live there now... mound-builders who lived BEFORE AND AFTER a world-wide flood, hm... where have I heard that before...?I hope you enjoyed my (again) **GROSSLY OVER-SIMPLIFIED** (due to time and space and attention constraints) (and his is the first time I have tried to articulate the WHOLE idea in one breath) explanation of why I love the topic of Ancient America.**BONUS** If you got this far you deserve a treat. So here you have it, in good old Q fashion:Did the Natives ARRIVE and find people already here or were they the children of the original inhabitants?Why did Hitler call the Native Americans "Honorary Aryans"?Why did he go berserk when he began to excavate in the Middle East?What museum exhibit was Saddam planning to open?What famous leader, hated by the current rulers of the world did Saddam call/have himself painted (literally) as?What was taken from the Iraq National Museum?When the war begins, I know EVERYONE is gonna break into the museum, go past the on-display fakes, blow the hinges off the vaults and steal the real artifacts. Yup, that's how normal people riot.

Anyone know the obsession with death and rebirth in freemasonry or other societies? Is this something an initiate must undergo, at a certain degree? Something where you are physically put to sleep and awaken after 3 days, or something along these lines?If the great pyramids were not actually just burial chambers for kings, but actually temples for initiation, I can understand why there are constant mentions of tombs. Initiates were put to sleep and "reborn" upon awakening. I listen to a lot of rap music, especially the older stuff (90s to mid 2000s), and as a genre rap is very anti-occult and anti-secret society. Constant subtle mentions of occult beliefs and worship. The thing is you have to know those beliefs beforehand to catch on. They always seem to mention sleep, usually claiming they never sleep. They usually reference the classic nas line of "I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death". This implies they would never join and undego such a ritual. I've heard this numerous times. Jadakiss and styles P on the track "banned from TV". Cam'ron has the verse before these two where he says "Rich faces, sick places. See my story is 6 thousand, 6 hundred and 66 pages". Then jadakiss and styles P have lines shortly after saying "do they dance with the devil when they sleep?", as well as "it's the shit that they kick in your ear, when your soul drift in the air". There are many more.Any ideas?

I'm researching the worlds fairs. Anyone have anything with worlds fairs and secret societies? Any H.H Holmes connection?

This has always been an interesting video to check out regarding Freemasonry and mystery schools.  The man speaking is one of the past grand commanders of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.

Some say it is not an accurate depiction of the man due to embellishments by the secretary, but the story is interesting and touches on the idea of secret societies with members who have extensively developed mental abilities and use them for either "good" or "bad" depending on their own natures:http://www.shamanicengineering.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Frabato-the-Magician.pdf___________________________________Theres a lot more where that came from but its late.

I really enjoyed your test chapter. Im ashamed to admit that I know almost nothing about your source material but I thank you for an entertaining way to learn about it :) 

Do you have a shred of evidence that Trump is working for this fellowship?

I'm confused. Why did you add a link with the title "...Hillary  Clinton called the group's [the Fellowship] leader, Doug Coe, her spiritual mentor" while also stating "liberal media talking about the Fellowship/Republican sex scandals? That doesn't make any sense. You only brought up Republicans when it had something to do with sex scandals. Why would Hillary Clinton think of the leader of a republican group as her spiritual mentor? 

There is a passage apocrypha, 2 Esdras 13:40-47 that many believe refers to the lost tribes crossing the Bering Strait into North America:"these are the ten tribes that were taken captive from their land in the days of King Hoshea, whom King Shalmaneser of the Assyrians took across the river as a captive. They were taken into another land, but they made this plan for themselves: They would leave the multitude of the nations and go into a more remote region, where the human race had never lived. There they would be able to observe their customs, which they hadn‚Äôt kept in their own region. They went in through the narrow passages of the Euphrates River. Then the Most High gave them signs and stopped the flow of the river until they had passed.  They made a long journey through that region for a year and a half, and that region is called Arzareth.  They lived there until the last time, and now they begin again to return. The Most High will once again stop the flow of the river so that they can cross."Legends say this was one of the sources that led Columbus to look for the New World.

This is interesting. I have suspected for some time that there is much more to the genocide of the native people in the Americas. I found this very enjoyable and informative. More please :)

Are you talking about the spear of destiny for the Hitler artifact? Did saddam have himself painted to look like trump?You aren't Q, answer your questions.

 

This makes me think of the Book of Mormon. Very interesting considering Joseph Smith's alleged ties to freemasonry."The books from First Nephi to Omni are described as being from "the small plates of Nephi".[51] This account begins in ancient Jerusalem around 600 BC. It tells the story of a man named Lehi, his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the Babylonians in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the Arabian peninsula, and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship."https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_MormonWhen Mosiah 1 discovered a people who had left Jerusalem with mulek, a son of Zedekiah (see Jer. 52:10; Omni 1:12-15; Hel. 8:21), and King Limhi's messengers found a record of the extinct jaredites, the Nephites learned that they were not the only people God had brought to the Western Hemisphere.http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Book_of_Mormon#First_Book_of_NephiAccording to the Book of Mormon, the people fled across the ocean on unique barges and established an ancient civilization in the Americas. The book of Ether's mention of "elephants" and "narrow neck of land" has led some to conclude that this civilization likely spanned from the Midwest to eastern states such as New York, where not only fossils of ancient mammoths have been discovered in abundance, but in many Native American accounts describe Niagara as the narrow strip of land which literally translates to "the neck" [reference?]https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaredites

Excellent

Your comment is like something out of One Piece. 

Could you recommend a book on the Paiute stuff? I found this one very good with a wider and shallower scope:  Encounters with Star People  Untold Stories of American Indians  Ardy Sixkiller Clarke  Her technique is she went into the field and recorded thousands of stories from widely separate locations and assigned authenticity to the ones that she kept hearing over and over and over again.  [Link to book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17076492-encounters-with-star-people)

These talking points are great...have you looked into Jimmy from "Bright Insight" on YT? His videos talk about ancient societies that predate the Egyptians. 

Since when is 8 feet considered a separate species of giant? There have been verified cases of humans with that height. I thought when people here talk about ancient giants they meant 20 foot tall like Gilgamesh. 

I like to keep my mind open to everything but thats a lot to wrap your head around. That being said, your red haired and black haired giants theory intrigues me.Since it's semi relevant, have you ever looked into the "lore" behind the book of Mormon?  The book was supposedly translated in a John Dee fashion by treasure Hunter and Freemason Joseph smith in the early 1800s. The book is a history of ancient americans who came from Israel and colonised Central America (debatable). The original ancestor of these people, Nephi, is always described as "large in stature", and his bloodline eventually is whiped out by another tribe.Obviously, a lot of the book has been debunked by anyone not brainwashed by the current church authorities (see precolumbian horses/wheat/steel). But maybe Smith was on to something? It's not far fetched to believe he was into the occult, so it could be possible. He was also obsessed with ancient egypt, and tried to translate some burial scrolls but failed miserably according to modern interpretations.

No mention of Solutrean's?

Could u please answer the bonus questions, ive found like 1. Really liked ur post, and added the usa locas to my vaca list. Thank you very much

Have you researched the Fomorians?  Believed to be an ancient race that the  Tuatha D√© Danann fought.  It describes them as giants as has many details about their battles and encounters.Michael Tsarion and other discuss at length these giants/fomorians and who they are and where they come from.  I'm trying to remember an excellent book written in the early 1900's by an old English author, I have it somewhere in my house.  He discusses what he believes to have happened in the English isles and around it and the peoples who lived and fought there.Also Sitchin's book on Giants is great: https://www.amazon.com/There-Were-Giants-Upon-Earth/dp/1591431948

 

This one is fun! My goodness, they need to open this already!!

This one blew my mind when I first saw it. This guy is great. Like you said, I fear "they" already opened it up.

thx it was really interesting! What has happened since then? I suppose it hasnt been opened, but do you have any news?

I'm at work, just did a little internet research, but can't watch this video right now (will check it out later), can I get a TL;DW in the meantime, or an ELI5 if my TL;DW would need it's own TL;DR

Why does he seem so fake

A ressurected or ascended figure is central to many religions. Osiris, Jesus, Mithra, Hiram Abiff, others. It's probably directly related to The Nile River's flood and dry cycles and the sun coming up. Is it all different twists to the same legend?Most people want their friends and themselves to live forever. Being reborn ritually is a great way for a master to exert control over what is now symbolically an infant. 

Your comment about the pyramids spurred a thought in my head. I've read a theory about the pyramids being used as devices that could project the consciousness of an individual out into the universe/to another planet. Couple this with the records of supposed ancient pharaohs who ruled for tens of thousands of years... What if Egyptian rulers were projecting consciousness of themselves at death into the mind of their heir at their inheritance of the throne? That'd effectively have an "individual" ruling for hundreds of years. 

>rap is very anti-occult and anti-secret society. Going to have to disagree with you on this one, especially regarding rappers today.There's a rapper named Xxxtentacion, who came up with a rapper named Ski Mask the Slump God. They had issues with each other, and Ski Mask claims that X said that Ski was "supposed to be sacrificed". A pornstar friend of theirs (not a very reliable source, I know) said that X "sacrificed X's soul".Then you have Lil Uzi Vert who is constantly playing off occult themes. Although I think this is a stretch, people have pointed out how much his name sounds like Lucifer. On his recent album (and really first major release) Luv is Rage 2 he has a song called 444+222. [This](https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_limit,w_606/fl_lossy,pg_1,q_auto/vf6phvcqcnvocvjclxqq/lil-uzi-vert-luv-is-rage-2-cover) is the default cover for the album, but he also released the version [without the Off White tape on it.](http://images-eds.xboxlive.com/image?url=wHwbXKif8cus8csoZ03RW8ke8ralOdP9BGd4wzwl0MJ9z6QzuGwZjtvbE7sSsMVWhmDcoR9EfZ6XIHrE8knGZXmFLs1.fPIqYBrUA5TZWzFslPN.gBKGp87.7yAyUkuKOVDPhlvk3uXeK8LGgbGvDpqCRmCByH7g3XmR5.Oy97E-&format=png) You can see all sorts of symbolic imagery that was previously covered, such as a goat head, a snake intertwined in arrows, and a halo above his bear backpack. Furthermore, he's shown depicted with bat wings on the corners. This isn't the extent of Lil Uzi's use of occult symbolism, but rather just a look at the uses of it on this album. Another example is the rapper Z-Ro who recently retired. His final album called "No Love Boulevard" has a song called "Devil In Me". Here are some relevant excerpts.     If I woulda signed that contract, I'd be richer than rich    But when they say die, I'd have to die face down in that ditch    (Everybody wanna try, to bring out the devil in me    What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D)    If I attended that ceremony, I'd be better off    Find myself a celebrity, but I'd be forever lost    (Everybody wanna try, to bring out the devil in me    What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D)        What good is it for me, to gain the world but yet lose my soul    I woulda been a millionaire, since 20 years old    I wouldn't have had to pay, for all of these diamonds and gold    Just sacrifice one of my people, I ain't really knowThere's a lot more to take from [these lyrics](http://www.lyricsg.com/352004/z-ro/devil-in-me-lyrics), but these few excerpts show him referencing shady record deals with something more to them.Finally, my last example will just be a [link to a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6u76yh/there_may_be_proof_that_coach_k_founder_of/) I've made in the past which shows what I believe to be (alleged) use of blackmail in the music industry (although could be explained as just some odd sexual thing). I wouldn't say any of these examples prove that rappers are involved in this type of thing, but it at the very least shows how often it is that rappers like to reference it. 

death of the human mind and reemergence of an enlightened soul

you're referring to the 5% nation of gods and earths, an occult spin-off of the nation of islam.  most of the rappers you're listening to are "Gods".  Each one teach one.  Supreme mathematics- know the ledge, 88 million miles away from... overstand?

 

About the death/rebirth thing, Joseph Campbell thinks it's a religious trope or archetype basically because humans have such a uniquely long development period post birth, it's basically to symbolize the death of the child and the birth of the developed adult.

You seriously need the book Fairly Faith. It was written in the early nineteen hundreds and has oral reports of fae in the British isles and Ireland. Fascinating book. I'll look for a link.Edit; found it free online.http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/ffcc/index.htm

Hell yeah! Bill Cooper is my man. Cannot recommend his work highly enough.

An excellent place to begin.

I hear that the teachings and traditions are pristine but the lodges today are infested with pedos and power mongors

No money for upkeep. 

Huh?

Any links or guides? 

I was thinking a lot could be bots but maybe it's a mixture of both. The ones who have long conversations are the ones who are masons. While the bots are the ones with a single comment and never replies. Just a idea.

Most shills are just low level Masons trying to work their way up the ladder of initiation. They also don't get paid and are doing it as part of their dues to the lodge.

Part of Ben Franklin's intelligence network. Chapter 10 of [How the Nation was Won](https://archive.org/details/HowTheNationWasWonAmericasUntoldStory1630-1754) explains how Franklin infiltrated the aristocratic and secret societies of Europe to buddy up to the elites. This was a cover for the American Revolution which was supposed to be like all the other controlled-opposition jobs, but ended up being a true revolution because it was planned out decades in advance.

There's a profound connection between groups like this, the American Revolution, and even the Bavarian Illuminati (all had their origins in 1776).In fact, the first state to declare Independence (Rhode Island I believe?) did so *days* after the Bavarian Illuminati was founded.Also, the history of the Revolutionary War is woefully incomplete without studying Freemasonry.The book *The Temple and the Lodge* by Baigent and Leigh reveals some fascinating tidbits about cooperation between Freemasons in *both* the British and American forces, especially the officers.

And low, the Sage sitting under the great seething Oak whispered his first lesson to the masses. I invoke the great power of the goddess of poetry. Speak in me muse, through my tongue speak. Tell of truths yet unknown, unveil the. And the words of the goddess rang through the sage. No longer a man. Now a vessel. Gaze unto thy navel no more. Look up into the world. We have entered upon the last age of man. The Kali Yuga. The iron age. Nothing is sacred in the last age. The age of the material girl and the death of the goddess. The age where only material things have value. Our ancestors once held notions to the level of gods. Justice, Victory, Courage, Death, and Love, all gods. Or held the the level there of. Gods in the sense that they are above man. We no longer have any gods in this age. Just the false idol of the dollar. Apotheosis of the lowest cast. The money making merchant. Shunned are the true priests, the bards. Sunned are the courageous, the warrior the protector. Nothing is sacred under the rein of those who rule by usury. Not, divine right of victory.Upon the mad presumption of Nietzsche, God hath died. Mad at the time but after the horrors of the last century we can see that in the abyss we are alone. He said that if you stare into the abyss of reality long enough the abyss will stare back into you. And that is why we are all gathered here in this sacred grove. We contemplate the death of god. The rotten body of god withered from the cross. Now a century on even the cross does rot. Buzzards pick at the glorious host. A communion of his flesh for the scavengers. Our western god has succumb to a Promethean sky burial. What can be done you ask? Rekindle the fires of your ancestors and they will tell you what must be done. Rekindle the fire within yourself. Become who you are.

So how's the great white lodge on Sirius? Haven't got to 360 yet? What's death like anyway?

The CNP has come up more than a few times in my research due to the number of overlapping Fellowship members and ties to foreign government evangelicals.  The membership is secretive, so it's really difficult to research either the CNP or the Fellowship.  :(

Thank you!  There are many problems with the test chapter stylistically (art and writing) that I hope will be ironed out in upcoming chapters.  The research on the main project is pretty difficult and time consuming, but I had to do one short story from my research to see at least a little something done with all that work.  When I saw several Ben Carson staffers move to Trump's campaign, then the Mike Pence VP selection, I started picking up my research again after taking a couple years off for "life stuff."

You mean a document from the intentionally secretive group which says exactly that?  No.  I just have the same massive evidence of associations that most conspiracy theories have.  I'm pretty concerned about the documented evangelical domestic and foreign policy agendas, coming out of the non-religious, secular businessman's office. I hope many Christians are concerned about that as well, since mixing business and politics with religion has historically yielded terrible human consequences.  

I added the link to show it is a bipartisan group.  The bit about the liberal media largely focused on Republican sex scandals is my criticism that [they don't cover this group outside of Republican sex scandals.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F3nDIdHcnE)  If you search the group online, the majority of mainstream news articles laud the group, except when covering Republican sex scandals (a favorite topic for some reason). I personally wish corporate media would report more on the bipartisan militant actions the group is tied to, [like Kony 2012](http://www.talk2action.org/story/2012/4/4/8029/40080/) But the corporate media supports shit like militarizing dictators when both parties agree, or any military action really. It is something Democrats, Republicans, and the corporate sponsored media agree on, so the news of ties to dictators, genocides, civil wars, coups, drugs, and more "shadowy" activities... does not get wide coverage.   

Columbus wasn‚Äôt looking for the New World, so that is false 

More fun to make people think!!!No, I wasn't reffering to a specific artifact, Hitler discovered the Aryans were the ORIGINAL Canaanites: NON HEBREW Semites, who founded Babylon - who were kicked out of their own homeland when the Exodus passed through. They were the original holders of the ancient knowledge we all seek - and had it appropriated: along with the title/history of "Semites", their land, culture, gods, stories and destiny.[Saddam had himself painted as one of these original semites: Nebuchadnezzar](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/saddam-hussein-and-nebuchadnezzar-mural-iraq-20th-century-picture-id164081152) [Bonus](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/22/39/d6/2239d645638ddfcb1890759aebfba2db.jpg)

Thank you! You are absolutely correct! (Fixed it)

I was skeptical about Giants, until I came across this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eePAIqPb69cIt's an hr long, but I found it interesting there are multiple burial sites from 2500 bc across the US of men and women over 8' tall, most buried with trinkets and inscribed plates. The video has a Mormon slant, but there was a lot of good information to it, which pretty much covers what you stated. 

[Hmmm](https://i.imgflip.com/17pzqb.jpg)

> ancient societies that predate the Egyptians. The Egyptian mysteries are the last place that the history is very easy to track. There are various legends dating to before the Egyptian mysteries and even before the flood, such as the Brotherhood of the Snake, masonic connections to Nimrod, Tubal Cain, and Enoch, but we don't have much to go on.

Island in Croatia i believe has giant skeletons ranging from 12 to 35 feet i believe

Smith was telling the same story everyone else involved in the mysteries has been saying... whether or not it is TRUE and not just a fabrication to legitimize their "blood line rule" or whatever, remains to be seen.Edit: Excellent reply by the way, thank you! You would probably enjoy the works of [Josh Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/user/TGRFP/videos) if you want to look more into this stuff... (his up to date page is [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/dayglow76/videos), but the fan page has is his earlier works)

So, you dislike giants, so my whole post is disinformation? Someone's bias is showing.So, you know the ultimate truth of everything then? Tell me.

Gigantopithicus

Obviously the word giant isn't the same in any language so you're logic with language makes no sense.. 

i fear they have in secret

i don't know i am waiting for Allen Greens next book to come out even if the dude is a total fraud and its all bullshit (which i do not believe it is at all) it is so good. 

Shakespeare was not a real guy a crazy school of people hid super intricate codes for us to find later hidden in the works of Shakespeare. Shakespeares tomb is filled with mysterious items and we want to open the sucker up and have a look at them. the guy from the video has worked for years decoding Shakespeare and has found that there are a lot of mathematical shit in the codes. including the distance to the sun the distance to the moon the etc etc its sooooo good watch it. 

k

interesting. do you know which of the 33 degrees you vow yourself to secrecy on the penalty of death?

>A ressurected or ascended figure is central to many religions. Osiris, Jesus, Mithra, Hiram Abiff, others. It's probably directly related to The Nile River's flood and dry cycles and the sun coming up. Is it all different twists to the same legend?Most of the mystery religions teach some variation of the dying and resurrecting god. These tend to center around explaining the seasons (Persephone) or fertility magic (Baal), but the deity is generally brought back by some kind of sexual act.While the details may be similar, the explanation of the story in the Bible is dissimilar. The sacrifices in the Torah are done to atone for moral guilt of humans. In the New Testament, the god dies as an atonement for all of humanity, the "Lamb of God," with God not sparing his own son as he spared Abraham's son.

That's kind of what happens in Tibetan Buddhism and the line of Dalai Lamas. Then again, Tibetan Buddhism has Dzogchen, also known as Tibetan Dream Yoga. You learn to have lucid dreams and astrally project. Projecting your consciousness from your body is a valuable skill to learn. You stop believing in death and you stop identifying with the body.

yeah ive heard the same of pharohs ruling for thousands of years through john Anthony wests studies. thats a cool idea, you got me thinking now too. i heard the capstone would be used to project some type of light into the sky. was that light the consciousness in some form? also have heard of their obsession with the star Sirius. it has importance in freemasonry too which has a connection to the egyptian mystery schools. maybe that was the death and rebirth they were obsessed with. they were obsessed with death, and had the book of the dead which they were taught while alive to be able to know what to expect in the afterlife, and maneuver it successfully. 

He's talking about Nas, Jadakiss and Styles P whike you're talking about Lil Uzi Vert and xxxtentacion. Hes talking about rap, not this new garbage they sell as rap

I haven't heard 1 song from any of the guys you mentioned. I don't consider them rappers. These young guys have all sold out and sucked the devils dick. Only a select few have stayed true (j. Cole, kendrick). All these mumble rappers are trash. Nas told us in 2006 that hip hop is dead. I'm talking the legendary classic rappers were anti occult, with maybe biggie being an exception 

ok. here the Game's version off of 'Dreams' from the Documentary album. "They say sleep is the cousin of death. So my eyes wide open, cause a dream is a kin to your last breath."  I dont think hes referencing letting his guard down. sounds more like trying to stay "awake" than be sleeping.

A theory I subscribe to is the fairs were part of a conspiracy to cleans all traces of the antediluvian society. Funny enough there will be one this year in Astana Kazakhstan the Masonic capitol of the so called nwo.

We don't have them in the US anymore because congress outlawed it; the host country/city foots the bill like when you host the Olympics and we don't want to pay. They still happen every year, I think it was in Milan a few years ago.

Of course! God bless you

Oh it's all good figured out what God was showing me. Took me a while , God sure is patient. You are right brother. It's all coming now. It's not going to be the end of the world but more a cleansing and a fresh restart.

Praise the person who transcribed this. I disliked watching video / audio of his radio shows.  I hope they had an audio to text program otherwise that must have been quite the process.  

Someday Imma write all those down...

Haha they were infested a long,long time ago. And its time for them to come clean

haha more like theyre shutting down to clean all the cum off the walls wherever they banged those poor boys. might take years

Why masons? Why wouldn't they be mostly just random people hired on the Internet or something?

... study the past to understand the present.

> The book The Temple and the Lodge by Baigent and Leigh reveals some fascinating tidbits about cooperation between Freemasons in both the British and American forces, especially the officers.Yes. That's the best source I have found on the topic and it does a good job of showing how the masons were all working together under the assumption that the American Revolution was going to be a controlled blowing off of steam. It wasn't, however, because Washington and Franklin had planned out a real revolution decades in advance.The Bavarian Illuminati was one of their projects. It was exposed because it was supposed to be exposed to create division, chaos, and confusion among the Freemasons in Europe.

Baigent and Leigh use sources which are known to be hoaxes and they treat them as accepted history. Basically they are clickbait whores.  If you want well researched dope about high weirdness in early America this might be the book you want:  Upstate Cauldron  Eccentric Spiritual Movements in Early New York State  Joscelyn Godwin  To make a long story short after the Revolutionary War the new American government decided all the Indian tribes who had allied with the British had to vacate far west fast. This left lots of room for people to homestead. They thought the land they were colonizing was empty. It was empty of people but it was not really empty. Almost every single fringe religious movement of the 19th century (there were hundreds) traces back to this area roughly Albany to Buffalo.  Did it ever occur to you that the angel who revealed itself to Joseph Smith was actually a pissed off Indian spirit who tricked the holy fuck out of him? Well that never occurred to me until I read Godwin's wonderful book. (I am not claiming that was what actually happened. But it never occurred to me that is what might have happened until I read this book.)[Link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26023879-upstate-cauldron)

Please. Only serious questions. None of this flat earth nonsense.

Southern Poverty Law Center released the CNP's [membership list](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/cnp_redacted_final.pdf).

2017 for me was almost nothing but "life stuff" so I understand and hope that it worked out alright for you. It happens and helps shape us into who we are meant to be, whether we like it or not. 

You claim Trump is controlled by The Fellowship and that his Vice President is a member of The Fellowship.Those are just really huge claims and it'd be nice to have some kind of tangible evidence to back it up.

Have you ever wondered why Columbus sailed under a Templar flag almost 200 years after the Templars were supposedly abolished? Of course, he didn't *admit* to having secret maps that showed the New World.

Could be wrong but I believe British Zionists were already writing about the Canaanites/Phoenecians being the true Aryans.  Check out L.A. Waddell.  

 

I've heard the Aryans and Semites originated along the anti deluvian Black Sea.

Defo a compliment.

Its a tough pill to swallow. I ignored giant stuff for years and thought I was open minded. I have just recently begun to scratch the surface. Still have no opinon but am keeping an open mind. 

 

yea indeed, really good, thx :)

According to Manley P. Hall, Sir Francis Bacon wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare, possibly with the help of Edward Devere, and other Rosicrucians.

Honestly, that's a really close minded view of hip hop and not one I'd expect from someone who is (seemingly) open minded enough to discuss conspiracies.There are lots of great new school rappers, and you can say J. Cole and Kendrick have sold out just as much as any other rapper (J. Cole did the whole typical label shit with his first album, Kendrick is reselling his album as a "collector's edition" with the only difference being the track list is in reverse). Furthermore, calling anything "mumble rap" is just an excuse to be ignorant. Plenty of so called "mumble rappers" are perfectly understandable, and even if you couldn't understand them that would still be stupid to discount them because of it (do you think all music in languages you don't understand is stupid?). 

Nas calls himself a prophet. Secret society or not fuck him and the lifestyle all those mother fuckers help perpetuate.

Ive never come across this theory before but it sounds interesting and plausible. Can you point me to any research, anything in fact, where I can start? Maybe because we live in the internet age I have an information bias, I can search and find a treasure trove of data, but the very concept of a World Fair blows me away and seems like something that is so overt and strange there has to be an underlying reason.

Read my long ass post in this thread I just posted, that's my question. (FYI hate flat earth)

Thanks for that!  This is from after the last time I looked into the CNP and definitely will be read soon.  :)

I posted a video link of [Jeff Sharlet stating that Mike Pence is a member of the group](https://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/21/jeff_sharlet_on_common_thread_between) that he wrote a [couple of books about.](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&ei=KK8zWr-BKYTcjwTUu6eQDA&q=the+family+the+secret+fundamentalism+at+the+heart+of+american+power&oq=the+family+the+secret+fundamentalism+at+&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0j0i22i30k1l2.19307.19912.0.21450.4.1.0.3.3.0.157.157.0j1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.4.220....0.tiN63IouAjA)  I did not say that Trump was controlled by the group, I said that the Fellowship is the actual power in the White House.  Trump holds the title of President and the people around him do the heavy lifting.  One of the earliest articles I have about the Fellowship is [an interview Jeff Sharlet did soon after living with some of the group for a few weeks.](https://www.alternet.org/story/16167/meet_%27the_family%27).  This may give you some idea about them, and there is more online if you become interested in the group.Jeff Sharlet dug through this unorganized collection to write his book:Brief Description:Correspondence, reports, financial records, minutes of meetings, reference files, clippings, newsletters, and other materials relating to the work of the Foundation (also known as International Christian Leadership) which involved developing small-group prayer fellowships, especially among government, business, and academic leaders. There is a great deal of information on the annual presidential prayer breakfast in the United States and similar events in other parts of the United States and in other countries. Also documented is the group's involvement in various community development, patriotic, and personal growth projects. There are restrictions on the use of this collection.Vol.: 592 boxes (DC; 240 cubic feet), Audio tapes, Films, Negatives, PhotosThe group's documents from 1937 to 1988 are available at the [Billy Graham Center archives in Wheaton, Il.](http://www2.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/GUIDES/459.htm) , but that stuff is not online, unfortunately, and it is unlikely to contain anything about Mike Pence that long ago.  Jeff Sharlet's book is largely based on research done in the archives, interviews with high profile members, a month long stay among them at one of their exclusive properties, and the large amount of work an investigative journalist does for a multi year long investigation.  If I can think of something better than that tying Mike Pence to the group, I'll come back and post it, but it's unlikely.  All I can really say is to read about the group from multiple sources, weigh your opinion on Jeff Sharlet's knowledge of the group, and decide from there I guess.Edit:  I will come back here sometime soon and post some more links and commentary since this subject did get a little more interest than it usually does here.  Thanks for not taking what I say without question; I will try to explain this stuff better in a more detailed post! 

No, I‚Äôve not wondered that, because the documents of the time describe Columbus using a banner with a green cross and the initials ‚ÄúF‚Äù and ‚ÄúY‚Äù, not a Templar cross. Also worth noting that Columbus was from Genoa, whose flag was also a red cross on white background. Furthermore, although the Templars were destroyed, those in Portugal were reconstituted as the Order of Christ, inheriting the wealth and status of the local Templars and acquiring Papal recognition in 1319. Where‚Äôs the source that Columbus flew a Templar flag, anyway? I can‚Äôt find even a non-reputable source for this online. 

Whatever it is they possess that is the birthright of all people - even if there is no secret at all... (ie: no more than men lying (all the way to aliens/god/magic etc))

Google search it. I had fun looking it up. Enjoy ur hunt

keep reading. you'll get there. 

Your logic does not address native American accounts of the men of giant proportions.  They don't call them giants,  so why are we discussing the English language history of the word giant?  It's irrelevant to the ideas being discussed.

That is one theory.

lol

j cole has comoletely sold out. he admitted it. he did it under jay z who was his connection. he turned the lights on for him, allowing him to run his own Roc Nation label, which has a lot of popular artists. some you might not even expect, like shakira. but as j cole said, "you have to play the game, to change the game." hes doing it for a good cause, in the long term.if you can clearly understand those mumble rap songs, listen to jay-Z, 'Do It Again' from his vol. 3... album, try to keep up and tell me what rapping is now, compared to what it originally was. in terms of the skills required to be the best in the game as jay-z is. they call themselves rappers, but theyre not doing the music the gangster rappers did. like how theres classic rock, and grunge rock. theres gangster rap which is anti occult. and theres mumble rap to dumb down society probably as a plan developed during the recent commercialization of rap music by the tptb, to destroy the rap industry.  

https://youtu.be/O00qB9JfAOgheres his song released in 1999 called "New World", off the album Nastradmus. he predicts what the world will be like heading forward into the year 2000 and beyond. one of the many many many things he predicts is "the rich get tickets to visit mars, while the poor people starve." elon musk and boeing in 2017 have just announced theyre racing to mars. elon musk owns telsa, and rich people buy his cars. so these rich people might also buy his tickets to visit mars, if he decides to sell this type of transportation. and theres a lot of poor people and probably will be for a long time comingi think if there were more people like him around the world, earth might be a better place. havent you heard what the world would be like if he ruled it? doesnt sound too bad 

Youre right. Your comment really changed my view. Brought up very good points there

don't have my ideas in order, very much a work in progress theory. I post tangentially related material to my sub r/CulturalLayer the researcher Martin Liedtke also agrees with this concept and if you can ignore the silly name of his show most of his research into history is very thought provoking i'll leave a link bellow. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6sSJbnTvY&t=1358s

*Ouch*

...so....nihilism?

Thank you.  This is all very interesting.  Please keep posting.

[Columbus flag](http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/es_colum.html). Same pattern as the Templars, just a different color. Just like how the Templars in Portugal reconstituted as the Order of Christ, but kept much of their secret knowledge.Look into the explosion of seafaring knowledge that happens around Prince Henry the Navigator, when Portugal is supposedly a poor backwater of Europe. They were finding islands all over the Atlantic, beginning with Madeira in 1420, as if they had a rough idea of where everything was. By 1488 they had reached the tip of Africa, 1498 India, 1500 Brazil, and 1542 Japan.

 

"I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollarsThey criticized me for it, yet they all yell "holla"- also jay-z 

What about his silly name "Lied"tke?  What the fuck?  To be completely honest these names of people that make public "waves" are so bizarre. Just like: > Reality Winner> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_WinnerActually her full name is "Reality Leigh Winner"What the fuck?> Dzhokhar Tsarnaev> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_Tsarnaev"Joker Tzar"naevAwww, no, they didnt!  > Edward SnowdenSnowed in?  Are they telling us something?  Maybe they want us isolated and fearful of being spied on.  (Think intentionally "leaked" documents for guiding the mind of the herd.)It's all a show, folks.  (Sounds like something the brilliant Bill Cooper would say.  The "local" (?) police seemed to have killed him for it)

seems like the signs are ramping up 

Nope..

One interesting thing I'll add quickly is that I was researching an obscure-ish international religious NGO (because I thought it seemed scammy) for a few months, going through their own publications and researching the things I found there.  The research starting becoming more than a mere "scam" as I was noticing many links to the military industrial complex, political institutions, banks, oil companies, etc.  Then I found Jeff Sharlet's book and there were so many of the same connections I had independently made via different research and documents.  It was pretty surreal.  The NGO I was researching is just one organization in "The Family."  I will write about that unnamed NGO sometime in the not too near future.Also, as far as "traditional conspiracy theories" go, the closest I can think of is "The Octopus" conspiracy theory that an [independent researcher was writing a book about when he "died mysteriously."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Casolaro).  I say this because when I first read about the Octopus in some articles online, I was well aware of everything they mentioned because of my own independent research.  That and some [crazy Wayne Madsen articles about the Fellowship](http://www.declarepeace.org.uk/captain/murder_inc/site/the%20fellowship.html) creep me out, as an "independent researcher."   

Madeira was known even in ancient times and appeared on maps for nearly a century before being ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù by the Portuguese. Even then, it wasn‚Äôt formally mapped and discovered until two ships were blown there by storms. Hardly the mark of a grand conspiracy. As for the exploration of the African and Indian coasts, the Portuguese literally just coasted along Africa until they reached the end. Once to the eastern coast, knowledge and maps of India were available. Local knowledge also allowed them to find Japan. First landfall in Brazil was also by accident and the land was initially believed to be an island (and was in fact named as such at first). You act like the Portuguese just got into a ship and sailed directly to these new, unknown destinations. But this isn‚Äôt true. Their discoveries built upon each other, and exploration was slow and methodical. The discovery of Brazil was dependent upon knowledge of the Canaries and a fort established on the African coast. Explorations of the western coast of Africa were done step by step, each voyage going further than the one before. I‚Äôm sure none of this will mean anything to you. You think it was mystical Templar knowledge, despite there being no evidence of such - fine. But the history is there for you to learn (and if you don‚Äôt trust what is taught, most of the primary documents still exist) if you want. 

> In the eyes of a historian, the Paiutes annihilated a rival tribe and mythologized them into fearsome, cannibalistic giants.You are assuming that a certain claim is proven and shared by others, when that isn't the case. Specifically, you believe that most ancient stories about phenomena that are not currently observable were fabrications.There are several examples I can give you that prove that this approach of scoffing at ancient stories has done history a terrible disservice. The most obvious example is the assumption that stories about an ancient flood (coming from hundreds of different cultures) were made up. Recent evidence has shown that there really was a worldwide cataclysm after a comet impact roughly 12000 years ago, and this includes 1000 foot-tall tsunamis and extensive flooding.Another example is the dismissal of stories that the Egyptian pyramids were tens of thousands of years old. It was long assumed that the Egyptian pyramids were built by Khufu about 4500 years ago. As real scientific investigation has been done, it has become clear that the pyramids are much, much older, as evidenced by water erosion on the surface.In other words, it's not a good idea to assume that all of these stories are myths, rather than legends or in some cases being fairly accurate depictions.

lol i think he was kidding. he didnt sound too dumb on his latest album

do you have any more information about the hidden information in the "names" that make it to the public? I am very interested in this. 

Lol no the flat earth British partI tried to write Self post recently explaining the memetic nature of flat earth I think some people understandhttps://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7hv9hb/flat_earth_is_a_meme_to_describe_the_extent_of/?st=JAYOFSG2&sh=e2ea3539

A long story that was planned long ago. People are blind

> Madeira was known even in ancient times and appeared on maps for nearly a century before being ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù by the Portuguese. Even then, it wasn‚Äôt formally mapped and discovered until two ships were blown there by storms. Hardly the mark of a grand conspiracy. That *is* the conspiracy. The Portugese had old maps, which is why they knew where all of the islands were. The "blown off course by storms" is a cover story, just as looking for a route to India was Columbus cover story, when the reality is that the ancients traded with the so-called New World, and this knowledge was eventually concealed during later times.>You think it was mystical Templar knowledgeOnly mystical in the sense that it wasn't widely known at the time. Not that they were using telekinesis or something.

Don't you get it, man? Some tribe fought another tribe and won, but because ancient people were so stupid they consistently depicted them as giants who ate people as a metaphor for how ferocious they fought back. But obviously the tribe that won were more ferocious to win against them. That's why they depict themselves as... Uhh... Normal looking people? Wait a second... 

No, sorry. These are just the ones that were bizarre enough to recall when I came across Liedke.  I suppose Ob($)ama could even be considered a candidate for the list...

So where‚Äôs the evidence for any of this? 

>because ancient people were so stupidThat assumption is your problem.

oh, thanks anyway. True, there are many secrets with Obama, not surprised at all.

History. Which is more likely, that a backwater nation locked in constant warfare to retake the Iberian peninsula suddenly became the world leaders in navigational technology, or that they had some kind of information that wasn't available to other nations?

Check out this book by Freddy Silva: "First Templar Nation: How Eleven Knights Created a New Country and a Refuge for the Grail". Plenty of evidence in there. Great book, and very well researched.

Sorry, I thought the sarcasm was obvious. Should have put a /s at the end there. I know there's been blatant obfuscation of our human history and where we come from and who else we've shared this earth with. I was just using my comment as an example to show how stupid the assumptions made today with regards to ancient man are. 

Considering that:- Portugal had completed its Reconquista in 1249    - Portugal‚Äôs discoveries largely followed those of Spain in the New World (Brazil wasn‚Äôt discovered under *after* the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed, obviously after Spanish ships had proven the existence of a New World)    - Portugal was far from a backwater nation in the sixteenth century    - There is no evidence of any hidden knowledge influencing their explorations, Templar or otherwiseYes, I‚Äôll say that the mainstream version is much more likely. Seriously, do you have any shred of evidence? So far your ‚Äúevidence‚Äù has consisted of a flag, incorrectly identified as a Templar banner, and a leading question. 

Check out this book by Freddy Silva: "First Templar Nation: How Eleven Knights Created a New Country and a Refuge for the Grail". Plenty of evidence in there. Great book, and very well researched.

Banking as a whole is parasitic. Many financial institutions make up rules that are impossible to follow to charge fees to customers left and right. When they fail to generate enough profit from these shady practices they resort to explicitly criminal activities. David graeber makes a great point about how crucial banks are to our society when comparing the strike from bank of America workers to the time when the NY garbage workers went on strike. It took no time at all for the city of NY to fall into chaos as trash piled up everywhere and people noticed a large impact on quality of life. When bankers go on strike no body notices. We could have a system that lends to those who need it for essentially nothing which would be much more efficient, instead we have a system where we have to pay money to access our own money via ATM.I think Peter Joseph hits the nail on the head when talking about how unnatural these institutions are to the state of nature. There is no reason to have such a thing except for robinhood in reverse.Also; Citigroup hand picked Obama‚Äôs cabinet members

If we the people started our own NOT FOR PROFIT bank.  we could be free by the end of the week.everyone agrees to have their wages paid into the co-op.loans, mortgages and credit cards at 1%all profits paid to all with an account as a dividend share.its so easy, the point is that banks are set up for the soul reason to extract wealth via usury. this is why usury was unlawful illegal and immoral.but when you have bankers who make the laws you are fucked.  all that is really needed is the masses to get good enough at maths to realize they are being robbed blind.   but thats hardly going to happen at this rate.plus you need to have a banking license to set up a bank... and guess who issues them.....   doh

I feel like the idea of American "sovereignty" is sort of tangential to this whole topic.  The same people who cry about "sovereignty" are usually first in line to sell out to foreign banks.no bloated military -> no stupid foreign wars -> no national debt -> real sovereigntyIs that likely to happen?  Let's just say I'm not betting on it.

1. In a public company, the shareholders own the company. Shareholders care about one thing above all else, getting a return on their investment. This includes the average joe with a 401k or who invests savings in the stock market. When the owners of the company want a return on their investment, it means they employ their employees 'CEO' and other managers to pursue profit above all else. Profit is what makes a company's stock price go up. This is important because it shows that 'pursuit of profit' is actually structurally built in to the system in this regard. Therefore it is incorrect to assume that those who are pursuing profits are all greedy and evil. This current structure needs to be changed, but this is outside of the discussion for the time being.2. Federal Reserve has been printing money in a way that is unconstitutional. This needs to stop. It's the world's currency.3. Oligarchs, politicians, lobbyists, and investors hide their agenda by using complicated webs of proxy and shell companies that can make it nearly impossible to link back to the original person or group. This is how money is often transferred and accountability is avoided. 4. Govt. budgets are not what they seem. Often times money or resources from departments you would least expect are actually used to add money to black projects. This is in addition to the $40-$80 billion annually that goes to black projects. Other ways of raising money for black projects are stealing drugs from terrorists and selling them on US streets (CIA) and getting the federal reserve to print more money illegally.5. One World Government has one aim and that is to transform earth into a slave planet ruled by a handful of elites. There is no other way to see it. That is what it is. It would seem that movements with seemingly positive intentions like 'global warming' and 'globalization' have either been hijacked by NWO and are being used to push their evil agenda, or they were lies from the onset.6. The shadow government controls the deep state and the deep state controls the media, entertainment industry, and many in government.7. The deep state enforces its secrecy with blackmail. This means that the morally corrupted and easy to control are selected for positions of power. They use satanic cults, pedophilia, abuse, murder and other illegal  acts performed as rituals for several important reasons, one of which being creating blackmail opportunities. Brainwashed manchurian candidates (mk ultra) are used in positions of power as well. They are the evil guys who say one message, but in reality do the exact opposite.

The New World Order is essentially "the" conspiracy. All other conspiracies that are perpetrated by this global crime syndicate, are essentially miniature steps toward accomplishing the ultimate goal. This is the wet dream of our defective and sadistic ruling class, and it always has been. 9/11, Iran Contra, Geoengineering, big pharma, planned obsolescence, and all the NSA spying and illegal wars are all "steps" toward this grand conspiracy to essentially take over the globe and install a global dictatorship where the elite are gods and have total control. This full length documentary by Jason Bermas woke me up. Don't listen to the people criticizing the documentary simply because Infowars produced it. There are always people trying to get you to not watch this doc, everytime someone posts it. AJ doesn't appear in this doc, and it's incredibly informative. See it for yourself and share it around. https://youtu.be/NO24XmP1c5E

Definitely worth bring up the recent confessions of banker for the elite Ronald Bernard who states that top tier members of the global elite were conducting transactions to terror groups, and involved in sex parties where children were a part. The European level of banking he is referring to is likely conducted via the BIS. Newly Released Video: On-Camera Confessions of Dutch Banker Ronald Bernard Reveals Terrible Crimes of the Global¬†Elitehttps://clarityofsignal.com/2017/06/14/on-camera-confessions-of-dutch-banker-ronald-bernard-reveals-terrible-crimes-of-the-global-elite/

As it stands, the banks own our economy. People talk about the lack of bipartisanship in our government but it is clear through the way our politicians serve, that they serve the same people with the same policies. They are sold to the banks and major organizations for the purpose of feeding money into the system that "feeds the beast" i.e. the Cabal to provide them with all the power and resources they want. The system is built to serve the system.For example in the media, as we know, there are only a handful of people who own most of the media. These conglomerates work with each other to ensure that the major media stays in their control through major mergers. Those major mergers are all brokered by the same investment bank, Allen & Co. who ensures that the merger weaves out of the way of anti trust laws as well as ensuring that everyone makes a profit, especially Allen & Co. who take a chunk of the merger money as well.This is shady enough, but where it truly gets interesting (and gets more to the point of this discussion) is in the people Allen & Co employs, as well as the assets they have aquired.Currently Allen & Co employs former senators Bob Kerrey and Bill Bradley and most notably their Managing Director is former CIA director George Tenet, manufacturer of the 'War on Terror'They maintain a place on Coca Cola's board, the own major portions of Alphabet and Twitter. It has owned Columbia Pictures. They have irons in nearly every single fire in the market. They employ everyone from former government employees to former sports stars. They essentially pull the strings in the media and yet they are only a bank, and not even a well known bank but a very secretive bank. They are terrifying and they likely have ties to every media coorporation in the world, and financial ties to hotel, beverage, social media, telecom, film, and telivision markets just to name a few. They are a household name among the elites and they lead the way in the total coorporate consolidation of the global market, which is one of the greatest proofs of a Globalist Cabal.

As far as banking goesThe world has more debt than we have materials to satisfy those debts. As soon as the concept of interest was instituted, we began dealing in goddamn Monopoly money. It's all imaginary. It's a nicely developed system for keeping us spinning our wheels in a grind that takes us to an early grave.

2 words Knights Templar 

There are two bloggers / youtubers who have been doing big multipost projects on this topic which are nearly sync'd and seem to have some similar method. In particular they have done long reviews on two of the same books: *Tragedy and Hope* and *A Game of Nations*. The bloggers / youtubers are Jay Dyer and Gordon White. [Link to Gordon's "Archonology" posts.](https://runesoup.com/category/archonology/)  [Link to Jay Dyer's youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnt7Iy8GlmdPwy_Tzyx93bA)  It is a lot of material and I have not seen/read it all but I like this approach. Tragedy and Hope is a *very* long book but I agree it is the best place to start. Quigley was an insider and a believer and he believed the New World Order is a really swell idea. He might be the single most credible source on the topic.

Lol, when the people routinely violating other nations sovereignty with their giant military and giant corporations can't shut up about being violated. Y'all mfs are such doofuses. 

Bit of a derail maybe, but check this post from a couple of days ago about a "glitch" in a couple branches of Wells Fargo banks that left customers sol : https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7t542j/wells_fargo_glitch_leaves_customers_with_empty/Currently, Op is upvoted to 700+ but the "best" and "top" comment is a dude with 250+ upvotes shitting on Op by saying:"You do know that when you deposit your money in the bank you're letting them use it right? It's the reason you get interest. When a bank loans money they loan you're money. There's absolutely no need for a "glitch" to use your money."Like no shit, when did they ever "need" to do any of the shady ass shit they do? Never. They didn't need to launder for drug cartels or sell out the American public before the 2008 crash or forge all those fake customer accounts a few years ago to drum up business but they did it anyway. Why all of a sudden are they above suspicion for creating this very suspicious "glitch" ?Also, I hope someday to throw a Halloween party where everyone dresses up as out of work bankers and lawyers:https://mobile.nytimes.com/2011/10/29/opinion/what-the-costumes-reveal.html?referer=https://www.google.com/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/baum-foreclosure-firm-homeless-halloween-255004

I'm just going to copypasta from [a comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/6uamnb/the_british_angle_cherry_picked_evidence_the/) I put together over at /r/ConspiracyII.I've spent years since being the man with the boots kicking doors down trying to pursue the truth of the global big picture.I am increasingly convinced, by following the evidence, that the primary instigator against the US has been the British elite. (Not ignoring the Vatican/Jesuit, other issues though) I'm going to skip the citations which often bog down and just give the summary.[comment too long so this section will be in a reply below]In essence, the monarchy, oligarchy, aristocracy, and supranational bankers never forgave the US for the revolution, and recognize that as the only country founded on the principles of indivdualism and natural rights, it is the primary threat to their desire for a centralized new world order of globalism (that will be painted as a benign savior, but they will control it from the shadows). Therefore, the United States is the primary target of the NWO now that we have successfully toppled almost every opposition country in the world. These people think and work on much longer time-frames, so delays may happen (for example, Wesley Clark's 7 nation list was supposed to happen in 5 years, but it took ~17), but rest assured, once we are over extended enough, weak enough, probably through the last few wars that "need" to happen, the real attack on the US will begin. Syria is only a precursor for Iran war. Korea is the precursor for China war. Muslim extremists in southeast asia are likely to be the warmup for both of those. Instead of being a relative cakewalk though, as Afghanistan and Iraq were, this time the design will be similar to the Brisbane line "bleed-out" strategy. Vietnam level KIA/WIA, in order to get rid of our hardest combat men, most likely while escalating the miltarism of the police and other domestic agencies in preperation.

All I know is this, /r/conspiracy is currently under attack.

It's out in the open that a relatively small group(s) of very wealthy people in positions of power aim to dominate the world. Is it still a conspiracy if the masses are too dumb down and apathetic to understand this fact? >"The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks, which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank...sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world."  - Carroll Quigley------->"For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn't. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations -- One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared "ammunition" in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support. The UN is but a long--range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One--World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. The depression was the calculated 'shearing' of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank." - Curtis Dall----->"For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as "internationalists" and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it." ~ David Rockefeller------->"The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson." - Franklin D. Roosevelt---------->"Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws." - Mayer Amschel Rothschild

I always wonder why, can banks be above everything. Why big banks. Why can everything else fail exceot for big banks. Why did they, an business, get bailed out for screwing the American People over, and get more moneu because they would "fail".

Has anyone here been suspended from Reddit for no reason after posting a conspiracy theory? food for thought.

Of course it's not likely to happen, your bloated military and militarised police are propping up the failed US economyAs for national debt, well, that's never going away, if you decide to not to pay it, well the US will tank overnight, piss off china or Saudi Arabia so they withdraw their wealth from the US and call in debts and the same will happen

Will the UN turn into the NWO one world government? How is Israel going to polish up their image enough to run the damn thing?

Obama extended and expanded TARP

I agree with the problem, but not the solution.How do we have a system that lends to those who needs it for nothing? There would be no incentive for people to lend, and plenty of incentive for people to exploit. There would be nobody facilitating the transaction since they are not getting paid. How do we get past that without incentives?The problem here is not interest rates, its how most businesses are a mutated form of pyramid schemes, especially the finance industry. At the lowest level, you have your relationship managers, insurance agents etc. Pushing bad products and loans to people who don't have the ability to pay. But the system is in such a way that these agents get incentivized doing so.

I flipped my shit with bankers when I was told they sell carbon credits.

Bankers are an intermediary for handling and profiting from our money. Blockchain technology and crypto currency will change the game they instituted. A new generation of financial control is on the horizon.

Allow me, a small part of my history as well a part of this group, to post in this forum, a place of which is owned to by said respective "group"-if it can be called such- some information that suggests the grandest of conspiracies at play.  A conspiracy that is denounced....but with unfounded logic.  I bequeath unto you this information, and request that God on high, if he exists (which I now 100% believe that he does), bless all of you who seek to know truth, and who seek that which flourishes in the light.[A most scholarly approach](http://www.angelfire.com/rebellion2/goyim/je1.pdf); the first 12 pages of which are highly enlightening.A conspiracy theory so fantastic, one must look to the history of Russia, Germany, and our own current state of affairs to determine if what is the case.

What do you mean with "state of nature" institutions are generally unnatural arent they?

although there are some truths in the above, its basically a statement you would say to an ignorant mob with pitchforks and torches. if you want a loan system with no interest, its called saudi arabia. there are lots of problems with this kind of system. the only real point made is Obama's corruption in dealing with the bailout and picking evil bankers as cabinet members.

There's so much room inside of capitalism for public/socialist/local type ventures where profit isn't the primary motive. No laws even have to change. Current examples are your local grocery co-op, credit unions, some big Canadian insurance company, and some others. There's no reason why this can't extend cell service, payday loans, boring consumable products, etc. We really do vote with our wallets.

>to extract wealth via usury.This is the key. Many people today don't understand the concept of usury so they participate willingly (to their own detriment). A little research shows that an economy based on debt is a relatively recent phenomenon (1950s/60s). It doesn't have to be this way. We knew this a couple/few generations ago. Fortunately it seems like people are waking up.

Non-profit banking already exists, it's called a Credit Union... it's literally most of what you described, and they are a recognized non-profit. SMH.

I feel like you're making two independent points here.. Excuse me if I may..1. Modern citizens lack sufficient civil interest to understand how their votes, taxes and general complacency only fuels the fire that burns freedom. Yes. And people on the whole lack the conscious powers to understand true and logic fallacies - let alone their own potential  - I'm applying broad dollops of artistic Liberty to your point here but with this framing then yes I agree   .. However ...2. American sovereignty is somehow tangential to the story of banksters and their oligarchic rise to one world domination. On this point I disagree - America is the story. Maybe less as we look forward. But the Rise of bankings global class is etched into American history. Not just the rise of modern financial Titans but also the primary cultural battleground for civil takeover. You see America dared to dream. In America that underlying dream was freedom. To be a Republic free from church or state totalitarianism yes but especially to be free from the banking malaise. America grew from independent currency - Colonial Scrip and despite some funding of unrest, much foundational infrastructure was borne from independent banking, so much it caused the Civil War,  motivated generations of iconic American leaders and bonded generations of pioneers. Example is the Bank War - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_War - a popular enough rally point, to fight off a second concerted effort of putting a Central Bank into Americas heart. Enough by the way to keep that particular beast at bay for another 80 years until the creature came back from Jekyll Island. The wider point being that American people have always fought banks. It's deeply ironic now of course that America is a weapon wielded by Wall St. Ironic yes. But tangential - absolutely not. Fuck the War on Terror. Control of Money is America's biggest battle. Always has been. And unfortunately most Americans find it hard to swallow factthey've been on the losing side of this one for over a century now.

>The same people who cry about "sovereignty" are usually first in line to sell out to foreign banks.My history is a bit rusty. Refresh my memory. Which foreign banks did Thomas Jefferson sell out to? Jefferson:>"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs."And surprise, the top 1% own 95% of the wealth. 

Indeed. And we can stop them if we expose them to the masses and wake the population up. It's already happening. They are very far behind in their one world currency, one world religion, RFID chipped population, and North American Union. Better keep up with us, you globalist fucks üñï

[Here‚Äôs the interview on YT, in english](https://youtu.be/cRuKmxQSPSw)

You're right. We need to find the right Jenga block to pull so that the tower comes tumbling down.

IHS

    1812 - British invasion    1839 - First opium wars to soften Asia up by British.    1841 - British instigation of Mexican-American war due to desire for the territories.    1854 - British used Americas power et al to force Japan to open up.    1856 - Second opium war as part of long term British takeover of China strategy.    1860 - British backed confederacy through infiltration of masonic and KKK orgs to try to divide and conquer us. Russian Tsar sent fleets to protect us against British backed invasion. (an army was amassed on other side of mexican border. )    1890s - Spanish American war where British covertly armed and funded the US as an ally in a ploy to decrease the animosity Americans had for them. (Maine false flag)    Late 1800s through early 1900s - Some of the American Indian wars (most the east coast, Hudson bay ones) secretly backed by British.    1899 - Phillipine war triggered by British globalists Paris Treaty    1900 - Eight nation alliance against China as test of alliance style entanglement of US into war.    1909 - Normad Dodd indications that Cecil Rhodesian group planned to infiltrate our education system and state department in preperation for getting us into war, which King Edward the 7th setup by creating the triple entente. This is the primary place the Rothschild Zionist banking group comes in, because Edward the 7th gave gave zionist bankers access to the court (court jews) in exchange for profits.    1910 - Edward 7 dies unexpectedly, throwing small wrench in plans. Rhodesian/Rothschild group carries on. British backed Japanese annex Korea as part of coming propup of Russia/Korean enemy.    1913 - Woodrow Wilson elected on the promise of not taking us to war. His handler, Edward House, and his handler, Sir Earl Grey (yes the tea), manipulated him into the war.    1914 - WW1 starts as planned    1916/17 - America dragged into the war, while bankers funded Nazis and Bolshevik revolution (and killed the Tsar and his family in revenge for his father Alexander III thwarting the 1860 plan) British use likely false-flag Zimmermann Telegram to bring US into WW1 on the heels of the Border war.    1939-45 - WW2 as continuation of WW1. British sought to make American losses great in the Pacific so at the end of the war there would be a balance of powers. (Brisbane line pushed by Churchil along with the island hopping strategy, which McArthur saw through and ignored, instead creating the leapfrog strategy, leading to the defeat of the Japanese at Guadalcanal.) Don't forget war plan red in which the US knew Britain might become an enemy.    1949 - British globalists used Kissinger et al to support Mao as the new communist enemy against the nationalist Chiang Kai-shek. British backed New york bankers and Harriman group funded Stalin as part of the coming cold war, intending for Stalin to push the north of China. One telling fact is that the British were one of the first nations to recognize Mao's government and started sending him supplies.    1950 - The British, looking to cut the US down since the Pacific play didn't work as well as intended, got the Korean war kicked off. The Harriman group pushed Truman into Korea, and they tried to setup McArthur by giving him inferior forces and supplies (likely in revenge for his thwarting of the pacific bleed-out strategy), but McArthur's strategic brilliance ended up winning despite him being setup to fail. Since instead of weakening the US, the "win" (hard to call it that with so many casualties), in Korea actually strengthened the US, the British started playing double and triple spy games in London to further foment the cold war. Using groups like the Cambridge 6 (everyone knows of the Cambridge 5, the 6th man was Victor Rothschild, and many more than just that), to leak information to the soviets as part of the strategy. (they were triples because, on the surface they were British agents, next layer they worked for KGB, but underneath both of those were working for the Monarchy and oligarchs, creating plausible deniability for the British.)    1951 - Through the leaks of this group to Mao, Mao knew when to commit massive forces to Korea in the third phase offensive.    1958 - Lebanon Crisis the first inklings of the coming cold war, anti-communist justification for interventionism.    1961 - Second inkling of cold war via Bay of pigs as inevitable type of offshoot of organic Cuban alliance with Soviets (no first hand British involvement as far as I can tell)    1963-75 - British setup of Vietnam (Laos/Cambodia) conflict (which they tested on the French) culminated with the assassination of president Diem, with the help of the CIA/MI6, with Henry Cabot Lodge participating. Despite this, Kennedy resisted the entanglement, but was conveniently assassinated himself exactly 20 days after Diem, which gave the pre-controlled LBJ the presidency so the globalists could push for escalation. The British officer Sir Robert Grainger Ker Thompson was one of the main strategists advocating for escalation, even before JFK was shot, and was supposedly the worlds first expert on counter-insurgency operations (COIN) due to his success in Malaya. Robert McNamara, SecDef, later wrote a book which verified that after JFK, Thompson was the single most influential person pushing LBJ into Vietnam. He advocated for an occupation style strategy (one of the first references to a "hearts and minds" strategy I've found) with many US boots on the ground in the south. The South Vietnamese defense minister recognized the real threat as the NVA and their infiltration along the Ho Chi Minh, and recommended a fortified line from the DMZ into the edge of Laos to block the Ho Chi Minh, giving the south Vietnamese army the breathing room they needed to take civic action in their own country (as opposed to foreign occupation), and if the NVA massed to attack the line, US amphibious landings could quickly counter and destroy them. Thompson condemned this plan, likely as part of the British plan to further entangle and weaken the US in pursuance of "the balance of power", because in the end, the south lost due to exactly that, a cross border invasion of the NVA. The Viet Cong was in essence, a diversion. Did I mention Thompson was a close friend of Kissinger?    1982-89 - Libya bombing, Grenada, Panama, Lebanon - all extensions of the cold war or wars to protect Israels (Rothschild Zionists) interests.    1990 - First gulf war as natural extension of setup by British of the Baathists and also the Sauds in the early 1900's, with Kuwait as the oil rich middle chess peice.    1992-94 - First main testing of British globalist NATO in military operations in the Yugoslav wars.    2001+ - British Rothschild Zionists use their plausible deniability teams (MI6, Mossad, and CIA, Pakistani ISI, Saudi GID) to attack the WTC and instigate the war in Afghanistan and later Iraq and eventually the entire, never-ending global war on terrorism. The British learned how to play the superior military power of the US and is/was repeating the playbook of getting us into a quagmire (like we and they did to the Soviets in Afghanistan), so as to weaken our military (backfired slightly in the sense that we got much better at 21st century combat), but primarily to overextend our financial and political resources globally and to lose much of our international support. All of this most likely in preperation for an internal coup of the US through subversion, infiltration, and blackmail or coercion of top positions through all three branches of government including the fourth estate of journalism and media as they merger and aquisition their way to monoplies and further centralization in preperation for the ushering in of the NWO, most likely to start through a currency collapse of the dollar and likely to be replaced with a global or North American Union/Euro type digital currency (such as bitcoin) designed to seem like a savior while it's real intention is to allow both the tracking of all transactions and persons (cash is anonymous, BTC is not!), and it is most likely they have somehow taken control of %50+ (enough to manipulate BTC) or have a backdoor already in place.

The excuse for the bailout was that if the banks were to go under it would crash the economy too far. Obviously the real reason is greed. According to economists like Peter Schiff, if the banks hadn't gotten bailed out, it would have depressed the economy even farther for sure, and taken much longer to recover, but we would have been a stronger country in the long run and not nearly as worried about another crash in the near future. That transfer of tax dollars from the people who lost the most back into a bank bail out for the people who caused the crash and ripped everybody off...twice then...is one of the most egregious examples of an elite, greedy, corrupt, sociopathic group of people and institutions fucking the little guy outta his money and then flipping him the bird...ever.

Nah, use crypto currencies. We don't need ANY financial institutions, when the world wakes up to this fact we are going to snowball down a path to complete financial freedom which will lead to freedom in all other aspects of our society.

You take the private profit out of it. Credit unions are one way to do this. They still charge interest on loans and pay interest on deposits, but the difference is that there are no private shareholders reaping the profits. Any surplus revenue the credit union makes is either returned to members as dividends, used to lower interest rates on loans, or used to increase interest rates on deposits. Credit unions also have the advantage of keeping your money closer to your community. If you put $10K in as a deposit, that will be loaned out to homebuyers or small businesses in your community. 

There are a couple solutions; either one central bank that lends, or localized institutions or directly borrowing from the people. These would be public goods and the intensive being that it provides a much needed service. Not every intensive has to be profit. I dont think exploiting the system would be much more prevalent that what we currently see. You would still have to prove in some way your ability to repay or have someone co-sign a loan.

Don't make it a "Jew thing" please.This crime syndicate includes people from all races and religions.

I can watch docs of just about any production value... narrators with accents... bad copies from old VHS tapes... sound-only.But the two things that kill it for me are over-dramatic music and text-to-speech robot readers. So I didn't get very far in that first one.

Sadly this is all so interesting to me but I want to see the end to see proof and validate something that people believe and also it would be an honor to see the end as if the same as seeing the start of mankind.. Don't get me wrong I prefer we prevail but this everyday bulsht with nothing dramatically changing in the world is boring as shite from a first world standpoint watching people become more controlled and only care about themselves and not even want to hear the news cause its real and depressing, people make me sick and maybe we deserve this fate.. Although none of the sick bastards in charge deserve to live I would prefer we all die than the most selfish live on and decide mankind's fate.

He sold out to the bloated military, who in turn sold out to foreign banks.  I mean, it's right there in your quote.  They're whining about not being able to print money, as usual.

 

Misc relevant things:[The best academic paper for seeing the corporate control structure](https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1107/1107.5728v2.pdf)The best authors on this subject: Carroll Quigley, Anthony Sutton, Peter Dale Scott, G Edward Griffin, Webster Tarpley, Fletcher Prouty,  Adam LeBor, John Perkins (among many others)The Federal Reserve is a root-causal issue, but in the bigger picture of the world government they did this to almost every country (and those that resist get the jackals sent in), so the real banking entities to take a look at are the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.[One of the most insightful interviews about this subversion/takeover is of Norman Dodd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUYCBfmIcHM)Hollywood and the media, answer to the bankers. Arms trafficking? Bankers involved. Drugs trade? Bankers. Art for money laundering? Bankers. Sex trafficking, including children? Bankers. [Even darker things. Bankers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRuKmxQSPSw)I think another really interesting point though is to understand the power dynamic between some of the aristocracies and the bankers. So the real question is, even for the very rich and powerful British monarchy for example, do the [bankers control the aristocracy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBPFSHxXsAAP1JX.jpg), or is it the other way around, or is it mutual? I feel like discovering the details of that answer/question contain much knowledge to be found.Now, for the BIS angle, I think we have to take a look at the occult in Switzerland. For example, the early CIA days had many hidden connections to what chatzefratz calls "The Octogon", [Allen Dulles a key example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NQ5sERePz8), [The Corbett Report on Allen Dulles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4respKAbOc)In the end, from my American perspective, the OSS, later the CIA, is the main rogue agency responsible for the continued  infiltration and subversion of the American Constitution. Never forget that the CIA got it's start on Wall Street, and a key finding of mine is that all roads from Wall Street/DC lead to either to the City of London or the Vatican.Therefor there is also much knowledge to be gained from studying the relationship of what I call ["The Three Sister Cities".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFZnwl1x8gc)Now this is where /r/conspiracy will really pay attention. These connections are the ones that tie the modern banking system into the ancient mystery religions and the occult. The Templars connections to the Vatican and the City of London are just the surface level, and there are so many deeper things to be discovered in this realm. A key example of this is the unusual amount of CIA people who are Knights of Malta. Don't forget Malta has some of the most ancient architecture that is very relevant to occult studies. I mean from Malta we have connections to the Minoans, the uknown "sea-peoples", possibly Atlantis, and some of the other ancient cities of the occult such as Tyre, Carthage, Venice, the Pheonicians, etc.From my research it seems that Venice was at one point where the occult of the Pheonicians set up shop, and it was from there that their power after the fall of Byzantium (which they were involved in) transplanted themselves to the City of London. That said, Venice is still a huge part of the globalist conspiracy, especially regarding banking. [I don't think John Coleman is lying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCzR7NCeMYA)Belgium is also a huge center of the banker occult. The [Dutroux case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djmm7GrgsUk) gave a glimpse into it.In the end I think the thing that Carrol Quigley was [afraid of revealing](https://youtu.be/pKClR0qCv4I?t=1461) that he discovered while researching the secret records of the round table group was that the mission of the shift from hard power British imperialism to the false "Commonwealth" was really designed to transition to banking as the "soft power" control system... and of this I take much inspiration from researching the ancient Sumerians (and the occult connections to them and the Egyptians), who I think discovered via their *priestly class* that by being the gatekeepers of the records of goods and money (tablets), they could have not just all the wealth they wanted but more centralized power than ever before.A quote from one of the men at the center of *THE* conspiracy that reveals the agenda:"Why should we not form a secret society with but one object, the furtherance of the British Empire and the bringing of the whole world under British rule, for the recovery of the United States, for making the Anglo Saxon race but one Empire? What a dream, but yet it is probable; it is possible." - Cecil Rhodes

I know, it's a fair system. I just would have assumed that anyone coming to this subreddit would be quite aware of this subject. I prefer the more 'out there' discussions.

Peer to peer lending exist today and it is highly risky. Why would people lend to each other without a markup knowing that the lender is very likely to default? 

You are right, it wasn't my intention to present thing in a racist manner.Unfortunately, I just don't know how to describe, or can find the right materials that do not use the word "Jew" on the banking cancer. The problem lies with the banking mafia who abused the "Jewish" banner to carry out their crimes. This I can understand if they are small little community during the medieval time, but for them continue to commit crimes under the "Jew" name is just unforgivable at this moment in the history.The other fact is ordinary Jews have been brainwashed to believe Jewish racist bigotry is commanded by God. Obviously, most of us do understand not all the Jews are like that. And to prove I am not Anti-Jew (I don't accept the term "Anti-Semitic" - this one is an abuse cos' it doesn't exist), here is one cool Jew I consider as a classy human being: -https://youtu.be/BIyJpW4F_1MAnna Baltzer is role model for Jews (and all the rest of racist bigots). Anyone knows her contact? I won't be surprised she has been abducted by Mossad (perhaps under the instruction of Harvey Weinstein? - Apparently Palestinians are so weak and helpless that Mossad simply got nothing better to do these day. So much as that Mossad gotta take part time jobs from Sex Pervert like Harvey Weinstein?)

But we're talking specifically about banking and the Federal Reserve, which is mostly run by Jewish people.

Basically, it is the prototype currency that has been proposed for the New World Order global monetary system. It ties in with the ecological problems we face in the future, such as air pollution, water pollution, etc. Each country (and individual) gets a certain amount of CC, which allows them to produce a certain amount of pollution each year . If they pass that limit, they get a hefty fine. This will make it very expensive to pollute (mostly for corporations), and its suppose to help us reduce pollution over time by hitting us where it hurts, our wallets. Individual currencies will still exist (dollar, euro, etc) but CC will be the currency that connects us all. Carbon tax will also be a thing, but I'll let you look into that.

Well 1% is just insane and unrealistic as a business can't cover their operating cost of servicing the loan with all the tracking and accounting that's regulatory required, but for instance I have a 30 mortgage at 3.25% which is pretty darn low. But the larger point is, yes Credit Unions are registered non-profits and offer extremely favorable pricing with little fees. They do most of what you are talking about. No one says you need to bank with some giant corporation and I have no idea why people do, it's the worst experience and more costly than a community bank or credit union.Do you have an account with a publically traded bank? 

but i wonder if we can try to create one for awake people..... lets see how long that lasts before they come for us.

Fuck off

 

Yep. Thanks for the extra link.

Now, I have lightly touched upon the past, in the modern context the power of the banks primarily lies in control of the education system, the political system, and the media narrative. In order to know the enemy, I compiled a list of geopolitical outlets, since I've mostly been focusing on understanding the views of the Kissinger, Brzezinski schools,(***Know your enemies!!!***) which dominate the positions of at least US geopolitics (eg State Dep). * 1.

It's called *regulations*taxes and regulations are never used to help people, only the obligarch fueled by their walking corpses.

The answer is that the Rothschilds are not Jewish, they are Edomite and bear the two headed eagle of Edom on their family crest.  Kissinger bears the Edomite crescent moon and stars on his.All warfare is based upon deception - you could call it a genetic false flag.  They claim to be Jews and are not but are they synagogue of Satan...

no no, you are absolutely [right](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7t02zc/rconspiracy_round_table_9_bankers_oligarchs_one/dtezbm3/).  read "the culture of critique" .pdf, findable with bing.

no. they are appointed economists. a number have been jews. Not the current one actually.

Ah I see. That's interesting, thanks for the info! I'd heard theories that some crypto currency could be the currency of the NWO but hadn't thought of carbon credits before. And I have heard of carbon tax before, but I will continue to look into that further so I can get a better idea. Cheers. 

When Al Gore started bragging about them, and being carbon "neutral" even though his house pollutes far more than the average household, that's when teenage me knew the whole game was rigged.

i looked into credit unions and they are a sorry affair here in the uk.   same rates as the private banks   but you don't get online banking or atms.plus there is no transparency i seriously doubt they are not for profit.think about how much a private bank makes in profit each year... if that went back to the people...........      instead of globalist pockets.uk has a GDP of 3 million million   per year.   90% of the working class are going to have to work 50 years minimum just to keep a home and family.they money is going into private pockets of people who do no work.

> reduced the overall size of the armed forces by reducing the need of state militias and federalizing the armed forceslol no

Ah right, children definitely werent forced to work shitty dangerous jobs before regulations.  Sure sucks that most places wont let me slave away for 12 hrs a day 7 days a week for pennies anymore either!

Who are you to say they are not Jews?Not trying to belittle you. But on what basis you can say these two "Literal Gods" aren't Jews, especially when they say they're Jews?Also, Edom is located in today's Palestine (or at least within the "Greater Israel"). What is stopping them from becoming "Jews"?Is it because these guys are basically pure Khazars.Fun Fact: I got an email from one "Robert Einstein" saying they are from Sodom. They are therefore Sodomites. I am confused.Bottomline: Both are Fake Jews?

Why not google?

Carbon tax/credit is the planned tax system to fund the world government control system. Also it allows whom ever controls it to pick winners and losers it business and manufacturing world wide. 

bitcoin is another supposed prototype, but it is too soon to tell. 

Yeah I don't think regulation is required to keep children from working, that's called society. A society dependant on regulations will experience crisis such as 9/11 until its collapse.

I think the trick here is to realize that the power that bankers and big business owners have over our lives is partly shrouded by the frontispiece known as regulations, worker protections, collective bargaining rights, etc. Yes, those things often are beneficial to regular people. I would not deny that. And we are led to believe that those rights, etc. were won by the hard work of union organization, social movements, political protest, etc. etc. It's sort of viewed as evidence that democracy works and the people really do have power. But it's a huge deceit and part of the con. Democracy is a smokescreen. The only reason those things were and are allowed is because bankers and big business owners view them to be in their own interests as well. They can promote their own interests by announcing them to be in the interests of all. However, it does not then follow that all those regulations, etc. should be thrown out the window. [Here is some research I did](http://mileswmathis.com/butler.pdf) [pdf warning] that goes into the role played by bankers and big business owners in developing The New Deal, which sheds further light on this topic. See especially pages 11-36. And [here is a link to part 2](http://mileswmathis.com/butler2.pdf) if you are interested. 

Yair Davidy has proven the Khazars were Jews who went into exile with the northern ten tribes and are physically Jews.The Science of Heraldry is admissible in a court of law to determine birthrites.  Their Family Crests prove they are Edomite.You'd have to ask them personnally if they are cocksuckers...

try the same search query with each search engine, and examine results.  Esp in regards to "the protocols of the elders of zion" or "jewish slave owners".  Etc.  Your masters are those you cannot ____

You think folks with brain will believe these "Jewish Testimony" or not? That millions of Jew went into exile in Khazaria?Sorry to tell you barely anyone out there even believes the Zionist version of Holocaust. What more when it comes to things like Fake Jews where even laymen can actually see the difference in their physical attributes.Perhaps you may want to invite the cocksuckers (you mentioned it, not me) to have their DNA tested by Nobel Peace Geneticist ...That may yield a little more more confidence. Anyway, why do these "Literal Gods" worry about not being Jews? They are so well off, guess they don't really need the Jews. Rothchilds never needed Jews, that's why they only F among the family - Fornification is only allowed among cousins/uncles. Else, direct incest. I wonder how many of them are retards (this is a Scientific fact - consequences of INBREEDING). Do you know?

Actually, you meant to say that barely any skinheads believe the Holocaust and sodomite = cocksuckers...

Didn't know "Fake Jew" are also proud to be sodomites/cocksuckers (as you mentioned). You know what, I recalled a documentary where a "Professor" from Hebrew University went to Poland to give a speech about "**Khazars are genetically Biblical Jews**" ... I switched channel as soon as I heard the mc said "Our distinguished expert is going to present the truth that **"Khazars are genetically Biblical Jews"** but asked that I **do not mention his qualification or professional credential!**"Do you know if that "Genetic Expert" is a Sodomite who has lost his mind? Or could it be Polish academics are historically so dumb that they'd believe in just about anything, even if it's coming from someone whose background has nothing to do with the subject matter? (I asked cos I really have no clue)

Guess you'll have to wait till judgment day to find out...

From what I've come across in the last year of research, this is the grand conspiracy, the one which all others stem from.Humans are concious beings capable of shaping reality around them. Thoughts affect reality. We can shape reality around us. We all live in a shared reality that overlaps with our own individual realities. Formerly, our civilisation was very aware of this and lived in an equilibrium of these abilities interacting with other energetic realms which have become inaccessible to us without training and practice. I believe it may extend to such a degree that the way a person can exist in a lucid dream, by which what you experience us completely alterable at your whim, is the 'norm' for unmanipulated humans freed from the grand illusion. Our history has been covered up and altered so we don't discover this truth. Our whole society is bent around physically and mentally twisting people so they don't discover this truth. Our whole current civilisation is controlled by a small group of people descended from those who have been aware of this knowledge all along but horde it for the benefit of their own adgendas. The notion that the physical is all there is, the incorrect information about our history, the manipulation of our society by media, the hidden hand of the intelligence/military industrial complex, all of it exists to make sure that mankind does not rediscover what we actually are and what we are all capable of doing. Conciousness an entire field of study that should be on par with physics in terms of how important it is to the reality we live in and it is currently dismissed completely by established academia. That should speak volumes. 

i tried to make a thread on this a while back but got almost no attention but ill repost here as i think its relevent to ufo tech. this is a recent patent from 2015 https://patents.google.com/patent/US8960595Its actually one of 5 i think granted to a dr. roy subrata describing the workings of a wingless electromagnetic air vehicle, weav for short. theres pictures and they are literally micro flying saucers. they match spookily well with the description of teslas flying saucer here. this link postulates that teslas flying saucer and flying stove are the same thing but on other websites and stuff theres some debate about that. https://nexusnewsfeed.com/article/science-futures/nikola-tesla-s-flying-saucer-electromagnetic-field-lift-experiments/#.WhAaT9OVHAY.reddittheres also a team at u.c berkeley working on a quadcopter looking ionocraft design. they look drastically different but use the same scientific principles to achieve flight.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/sci-fi-technology-could-power-microbots-180964358/what i find most distressing is the push to scale this technology down to insect size rather than up to personal vehicle size. i feel like its just a matter of time before swarms of microbots turn into swarms of murderbots like some black mirror shit.the conspiracy here is that flying saucers are man made and for whatever reason tptb are content to let us think theyre aliens. possibly some of them ARE aliens but a good portion are definitely man made. this also brings up the possibility of an entire breakaway civilization of humans living somewhere other than earth by means of this technology which, like wireless transmission of power, has been around over a century!

from another discussion online.  if you're interested, please look into liebniz, and come back here to discuss :)>>Leibniz: Conceptually the universe is a hologram, but physically it is a fractal>>There are two conflicting theories of the Universe--one being that it is structured like a hologram, the other that it is structured like a fractal. Here we suggest that both theories are true, and we can resolve the issue by adopting the dual aspect viewpoint of Plato-Leibniz that there are two simultaneous universes that correspond to each other, like the two side of a coin. One is the universe of Plato‚Äôs Mind (the One), the other is Leibniz‚Äôs universe of Monads (the Many), where the One creates, perceives and controls the Many. According to these two aspects, conceptually the universe is a hologram, but physically it is a fractal. Both theories envision an infinity in a speck. This can be so if the speck is Leibniz‚Äôs monad, in which the infinity on the mental side is a hologram, and in which the infinity of the physical side is a fractal.edit:  personally, i'm hoping i'll find a strong/entertaining connection to simulation theory, which i'm heavily biased towards.  it just happens to explain a lot of modern "weird" science in the most comprehensible way.  logically i get that that has no bearing on how likely a theory is to be true...but practically, i wouldn't be interested if i couldn't understand a theory.

I have found no greater metaphysical teacher than Scott Mandelker. On his website, http://www.scottmandelker.com/, you can find many free and illuminating essays on the mechanics of consciousness.On his youtube page, https://www.youtube.com/user/TWSMandelker, you can find hours and hours of talks on various metaphysical topics, namely his dissection of The Ra Material/The Law of One.

It‚Äôs interesting that this is the round table for this time. Everything is lining up. It is my true belief that people are waking up, that we will see how holographic our world truly is. I feel as though consciousness is a shared experience. Like if our world was created like how we dream up our dreams. But instead of one person, it‚Äôs everything coming together to make reality. 

Oh boy, have I got some theories here! As far as conspiracies go, and as far as my research so far has taken me, I truly think that consciousness - or suppression thereof - is "the big one". The end of the rabbit hole for some... (until you realise the rabbit hole is fractal in nature and never ending). But yeah, I've got a bit of an essay on this I wanted to share. I'll try and include as much source and reference material as I can, but if anyone else has more to add then I only encourage it.  **Holographic Universe:**  Mainly referencing the fractal-holographic theory of Nassim Haramein, the fractal-holographic theory essentially suggests that the universe is, at a fundamental level, made up of 'bits' of information, and that the information of the entire system is fractally encoded at every point through harmonic layering/nesting. Much like how DNA, a chemical compound within every single cell of a body, contains the information to recreate the entire human. A great metaphor to describe this is the Sutra of "Indra's Net":  *"Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each "eye" of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering "like" stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring."*  In this metaphor the jewels represent protons. Nassim Haramein tackled what's known as the 'vacuum catastrophe' (a mathematical problem that arises when you add up the number of vacuum fluctuations in a unit of space, as the mass that is calculated comes out absurdly larger than that which is actually measured in that same unit of space - for example: when adding up the vacuum fluctuations in a cubic centimetre of space you yield 10^93 grams, whereas if you were to take all the measurable mass of the observable universe and squish it into that same space you'd get 10^55 grams) by figuring out how we can derive the mass of matter from the fundamental planck unit. When you divide the volume of a proton by the volume of a planck sphere unit (a spherical unit of energy of planck length diameter, proposed by Nassim to be one of these fundamental 'bits' of information that make up the universe) and then multiply by the planck mass, you come out with the mass of the observable universe: 10^55 grams.  This shows that the exact amount of vacuum fluctuations that fit into a proton - when the planck spheres are stacked in a 3 dimensional ["flower of life" formation](https://gfycat.com/TenderLateEmperorshrimp) (as opposed to being stacked in a [cubic](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-faH_PCj4KYY/UDAvatnFtHI/AAAAAAAABDc/-xZuTez_JKk/s1600/SimpleCubicPack.jpg) formation) - equals the measurable mass of the observable universe.  But obviously that's not what we see when we measure the mass of a proton. Due to the size:mass ratio of the proton it fulfills the Schwartzschild condition for a black hole. Once we consider the proton to act as a black hole we can borrow a mathematical concept from string theory - the holographic principle - which states that the surface information of a black hole can encode the volume information. When you apply this, and divide the surface planck spheres by the volume planck spheres and then multiply by the planck mass, you arrive at the measured proton's rest mass of ~10^-24 grams.  Each proton in the universe holographically contains the information of every other proton in the universe. And every surface planck sphere of every acts as a wormhole terminations which connect all protons via a superfluid/superconducting aether, allowing instantaneous information transfer between all protons via an instantaneous information feedback-loop network.  *It's this universal instantaneous feedback-loop network that gives rise to consciousness at a universal scale.* And from there, due to the fractal self-configuring/self-evolving nature of the system, consciousness evolves to form higher and higher orders of self-complexity within the system.  For more information visit the /r/holofractal subreddit, from which I've taken taken this info and condensed it for this post (big shoutout and serious thanks to the admin of that sub /u/d8_thc for being such a good communicator of this information), and have a read of the stickied posts and links in the sidebar.  Also here's Nassim Haramein's "The Connected Universe" [2015 lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbE5bVl8r2g) on the subject.  Here's his "The Connected Universe" [2017 documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uScP9ntLLeQ) (narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart).  And here's one of his papers on the subject: ["The Unified Spacememory Network: From Cosmogenesis to Consciousness"](https://holofractal.org/hf/spacememory.pdf)  

I have nothing to really add.  I'm new-ish to reddit  I'm pretty much as my username states, lol.  At least, when it comes to these matters. Sounds incredibly fascinating but these are things that I know very little about.  Here to soak up all the cool info. :)

Great topic! I'm inclined to believe there's something holographic and fractal about our universe that mainstream physics misses. I'm even inclined to believe that "consciousness"/awareness is primal to matter, or maybe inextricably linked to matter. My issue is that there are a lot of charlatans in this field of discussion, and a lot more people who make claims which I'm sure they think are right, but can't back up. In some ways, it's hard to say whether a lot of these things *can* be backed up in any substantial way, even if they are true. We're talking about the very substrate upon which everything we know and experience is based. I think Something like G√∂del's Incompleteness Theorem for metaphysics has to apply. Specifically, I see a lot of these youtube videos which make grand claims and back them up only with hand waving, or references to "inspired" texts. It strikes me as very similar to the way that the ancient religions operate, basically appeals to authority. If anyone has any good reading or videos that approach this topic in a more rigorous way, I'd love to see them. I find things much more convincing when people only claim the patterns they observe, rather than claiming they're the ones with the "One Truth‚Ñ¢." I see u/Illuminati_LCO recommended Scott Mandelker, and I'll definitely check him out. Any others?

Also see /r/paradigmchange/  I am a major in Physics, and became sensitive for the paranormal a bit after my studies. Since then I am studying the aura and chi, and try to put it into scientific concepts. The major problem with science today is that it it does not like new ideas.  The model that I observe is that there are more dimensions. This is physically possible without any problems. The physical body is surrounded by an multidimensional aura. It works like a second body. The aura is observable as a flame-like body. What you are observing is the chi / life-energy flowing through the body. But if you follow the flow, it follows a line-structure. These lines are known in the yoga as nadis, but this repeats on all dimensions. Everything is connected with each other trough these lines/channels. At certain places they connect with each other and go through nodes, which act like ports to the next level of the aura.Each level of the aura goes deeper into a unity of consciousness. Be aware: there are many levels of this unity, and that can be confusing as the religions show us. The different levels connect unity all the way to our physical body.Now it is interesting that we see this same structure back in our body. Within our cells we have microtubules that control/guide processes in the cells, and communication between cells.It seems that these processes and communication can be disturbed with electromagnetic waves, when they are in resonance with it. But that is a whole other story on its own.On lower level we see that molecules are connected via electrons. And on the deepest known level the quarks are connected via gluons. There seem to be 2 more physical levels, but that needs some more research.The multidimensional network model, based on observations, connects consciousness and physics in one model. In this model we have some kind of free will, as we experience, and can consciousness influence the physical body as we can observe. Also can physical substances influence the psyche. It goes both ways.With this model, I can understand most psychiatric problems. Your consciousness can have problems on different levels of existence. I am now actively helping people with severe problems like psychosis and depression. I also get insight in how psychopaths work, and how we can help them and us with this disease.The multidimensional models can also explain all paranormal events that I know exist. Ghosts can move in and out of our physical observed dimension. Probably there are many more multidimensional creatures. We can influence (with enough training) the physical world that we connect with. I can heat something with my hands. There are also tricksters that try to pretend they can do these things, so it is best to learn it yourself via chi.But there is also the problem with sceptics. They seem to be very afraid of the multidimensional aspect of this reality. I usually see that they have problems with some multidimensional beings that parasite on them and their thinking. And from this fear and problems they react aggressively towards these ideas. Tip: Just have an open mind, explore these ideas and find out for yourself.

is anyone into leibniz's stuff?  or mike hockney?  i feel like there's never anyone around to help me digest their ideas...also not entirely sure if their ideas fit here.

Thank you for choosing the topic I suggested! I've got some shit to talk about with this, but I'll go in later on when I've finished work and have time. Dis gon be good!

Just wondering what people here make of Nassim Harramein and his documentary The Connected Universe. I have interest in his unified theory of physics, and his formula that calculates the density of the atom being equal to the density of a black hole is intriguing. I also find his theory that at the center of everything is a black hole (planets, stars, etc.) and even atoms themselves are black holes, as well as our entire universe being inside of a black hole. As someone who follows the cospiracy world though, i'm aware that his information seems to be a bit like a new age religion in a way. The oneness of his philosophy also raises red flags to me being aware of the many one world new world order conspiracy theories. Thoughts?

Can't believe u/d8_thc isn't here blowing everyone's minds yet! r/holofractal everybody!

Oh boy, this is gonna be great!

 

This is the stuff I love to read and talk about and not too long ago act on... I've posted this before but I truly had a few profound experiences/intuitions (starting with an intense mushroom trip) that lead me to do something unexpected, selfless, outrageous, seemingly nonsensical and against my own self interests . Just to upset the balance and see what would happen. The proverbial "drop in the bucket" that filled the vessel to the brim and made the waves that spilled over out over the edge.  I kicked a hornets nest. I contended with the forces that were messing with the natural order. It's hard to explain and honestly I can barely comprehend what happened. It's the kind of stuff that drives you and others mad. Psychosis. Neurosis. That's the thing about "making waves" or "shaping reality". The waves invariably come back at you and out in ways you can't predict and might not be able to handle or even understand. Which is why most sheeple will never make a big enough impact to affect reality either subtly or overtly. And even when you succeed it's hard to see the connection or the big picture... Let alone The unseen world and dimensions that surround us. It's the grandest version of "thinking outside the box".After I did my deed I was literally attacked by shadow entities twice and approached (edit: more like questioned/interrogated) by men in black type federal agents who asked if I was a terrorist. Not long after that Trump was elected president (for good or ill). I know it sounds absolutely insane but I feel like what I did contributed to Hillary Clinton losing. Chaos theory and the butterfly effect. The divine masculine putting a smack down on the toxic feminine/nihilism/dogmatism that pervades the west. Like after my little escapade the whole world started to wake up/go crazy. 

Here's my theory.  It's not one of a conspiracy, but more of theory that may offer some lose explanation of other theories.  These may just be the ramblings of an armchair physicist, but I think there is something significant in this theory.Our brains mostly operate at a quantum level, mainly by transferring standing waves and states.  https://quantumwavetheory.wordpress.com/tag/standing-waves/.  It has always seemed like our brains are capable of more than they seem to be, which are chemical calculators.  My theory is that memory and conscience are occurring at a quantum level above the electrical signals passed between synapses.  Those electro-chemical signals merely act as activators to kick off quantum state transitions.   The problem lies in that it would be really really hard to observe these changes.Why is this relevant to conspiracies?  I think it makes a lot of progress in giving credence to unexplained phenomena as it opens a new pathway into understanding altered mind states, ESP, and much more.   

Sweet! This should be a fun one. If UFOs (not of our own making) are real, then they are no doubt interdimensional and a huge supporting factor to the holographic universe 

We are living in the age of Aquarius. The sign that sun rises on the vernal equinox. If we can learn anything from our past this next 2100 years will be full of flooding. This is not a sign of global warming as it's pronounced on local media. Our polar caps are shifting faster than our land moves because of centerfugal forces on the crust and our wobble will push them more towards the  equator. Luckly our current revolution around the sun won't cause a flash freezing like the former ice age. These are all told by your ancient ancestors in long legends through time. Your place in history will not be from a blog. Think grandeur.

Didn't see this referenced anywhere in this discussion. I think this awesome former post is pretty relevant to this round table.Mad props to /u/Tillazack . I found it fascinating. https://np.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/7lmk7i/discussion_why_now_the_emergence_of_the/

I've always had an interest in the occult. One technique that can be used is the production of an Egregore - a manifestation of the will of an individual or a group which is given a rudimentary intelligence and goes out into the world to achieve your aims:http://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/sseg.phpThis is a great video, even if he's tripping balls:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mtzU9mVlk0

I highly recommend reading the kybalion, the Ra Material (Law of One), and some study of Neoplatonic philosophy. I think the radio analogy of consciousness is helpful, we tune into the dimension we choose out of all the multitude of interdimensional frequencies available. Another analogy is the slideshow of dimensions we pass through that string together into a continuity of experience, when the slides don't line up we have a discontinuity of experience like the Mandela effect. You choose to tune into or put the next slide in, and there is limitless potential for what you may choose, you just may be choosing a reality in which you have less control or things aren't as whacky as I'm describing, and the moment you choose to accept that or open yourself to the possibility things begin to change. (Some of these concepts are described by Bashaar the channeled entity)

Yay! Real conspiracy.

Looking forward to this.

This is so fascinating to me.  My question is....why do "they" not want us to know the truth?  Why would it be bad if in the past we were aware. What happened to us that we were aware, but now are not?

[Mirage Men](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2254010/) and [QBism](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-bayesianism-explained-by-its-founder-20150604/) offer some wildly fascinating potential alternative worldviews to me, though they seem pretty deeply misaligned with some of the more popular conspiracy theory community dogma in circulation.

I have conspiracies about the 60s psychedelic movement going underground and warping this election using social engineering, in order to collapse society and reform it towards a globalist Utopia, and I write about the mechanics of consciousness, creativity, mental illness, and Sociological stuff on my blog! I also Podcast this stuff, which is a fairly new project so there are only 2 episodes as of yet. **Conspiracy:**http://mad.science.blog/2018/02/05/utopia-2-sociological-death/http://mad.science.blog/2017/12/31/utopia/**Consciousness and Psychedelics:**http://mad.science.blog/2017/11/07/marijuana-perception-and-cognition/http://mad.science.blog/2018/02/20/exploring-darkness-theory-of-creativity/http://mad.science.blog/2018/01/24/waking-nightmares/http://mad.science.blog/2018/01/29/dopamine-economics/http://mad.science.blog/2018/01/25/thought-experiments-to-understand-psychosis/http://mad.science.blog/2018/02/14/paranoia-vs-grandiosity/

I think the film "Unacknowledged" is a good base start fron as it definitely touches on UFO Tech and Consciousness. It's all really fascinating! 

My children, you are all completely and utterly deluded.There is one simple fact and I will tell you this only once -**Your subconscious expectations shape your own reality.**The ancient teachings, which of course are just bullshit, are simply tools to make it easier for people to utilize this innate ability of _reality-shaping_

I want to believe this so bad, and I have an open mind, but there's several big problems that make it implausible... For instance, there is an annoying amount of literature on this subject (see the comments below for example), yet never have I seen someone, on youtube, reddit or whatever, who could actually DO something so outrageous as shaping reality. Surely if the premise is true, and the literature supporting it as well, there must exist SOMEONE who is able to do it and make a video about it, showing off his powers? In fact, it would be world news.

New Reddit is for losers.

 

Having broken through the veil of reality with DMT I can confirm you are correct. All "reality" is is based on your perception. Perception is the No1 most important thing to our existance. Next is language. Language is the only way information can be transferred. But back to perception, reality is contained within our heads. We can with proper training alter reality. Now as to why no-one has come forward and showed off these powers you need to understand that every human is their own universe and that we are limited to seeing only what we are hardwired to see through our faulty senses. I'm sorry if this makes no sense but there is no language in this dimension that can describe the concepts in my head. 

Any sources you're recommend in particular?

Where can I read more on this? I study physics and I've come to a similar conclusion. Looking for something of substance that I can sink my teeth into, not some vague "love, peace" bullshit.

Hey, you're on point with this post. Indeed, our potential power has been consciously hidden from us throughout our existence. Check out the Gnostic mythology sometime, especially the book "Not in HIS Image" by John Lash. Also very relevant is "The Cosmic War' by Joseph Farrell. 

After about the same amount of time peering at the same stuff, I would wholeheartedly agree with this.I think that cracks are beginning to show though and once truth really starts flowing out, it'll upend everything. 

Study of conciousness is currently dismissed by establiahed academia? Are you sure about that?

> Humans are conscious beings capable of shaping reality around them. Thoughts affect reality.Unfortunately this is wrong.  Human beings' consciousness affects *perspective* and how we perceive the universe.  It doesn't alter reality, it alters our perception of reality.There is only one point in modern physics where perception directly effects reality where data mirrors the perspective change - in Quantum Perception (Wave-Particle Matter States).Thats a *huge* marked difference from what you're opening with, which makes the chain of logic after it dubious, since its forumated on an incorrect notion.

If only I could thumb this up 100 times. 

Dig deeper man. Some CIA docs showed they already have a grand unified theory of reality. At the base of a pyramid you have energy = mass = information. At the top connecting all 3 like a pyramid is consciousness. So consciousness = energy, mass, and information. Literally this information is available, I'll let you know what keywords to search for. 

Beautifully said. It goes beyond just hiding knowledge though, our society is a minefield of sometimes subtle and many times harsh penalties for straying away from constrained thinking and being.

‚ÄúHumans are conscious beings capable of shaping reality around them‚ÄùI want to believe this. So bad. Let‚Äôs use Hillary Clinton as an example. One of the most powerful and well connected people in the world. If knowledge of this existed, surely someone like her would have knowledge of it and use it to their advantage aka becoming president and shaping her reality. She was just a general example, but there must be other forces at bay here because some of us can‚Äôt construct our reality no matter how strong our thoughts.

what makes you say this is a conspiracy when it's the obvious truth? r u a sheeple trying to mislead woke sovereign individuals?

We will make them kill each other when it suits us.We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion.We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how.We will guide them kindly and gently letting them think they are guiding themselves.We will foment animosity between them through our factions.WHEN A LIGHT SHALL SHINE AMONG THEM, WE SHALL EXTINGUISH IT BY RIDICULE, OR DEATH, WHICHEVER SUITS US BEST.We will make them rip each other's hearts apart and kill their own children.We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend.The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers. They will be busy killing each other.They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long as we see fit.We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they cannot see us.We will continue to prosper from their wars and their deaths.We shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is accomplished.We will continue to make them live in fear and anger through images and sounds.We will use all the tools we have to accomplish this.The tools will be provided by their labor.We will make them hate themselves and their neighbors.We will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one. This they must never know!They must never know that color is an illusion, they must alwaysthink they are not equal.Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal.We will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise total control over them.We will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom they will have.We will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their children in debt.When they shall ban together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present a different story to the world for we shall own all the media.We will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favor.When they shall rise up against us we will crush them like insects, for they are less than that.They will be helpless to do anything for they will have no weapons.We will recruit some of their own to carry out our plans, we will promise them eternal life, but eternal life they will never have for they are not of us.The recruits will be called "initiates" and will be indoctrinated to believe false rites of passage to higher realms. Members of these groups will think they are one with us never knowing the truth.They must never learn this truth for they will turn against us.For their work they will be rewarded with earthly things and great titles, but never will they become immortal and join us, never will they receive the light and travel the stars.They will never reach the higher realms, for the killing of their own kind will prevent passage to the realm of enlightenment. This they will never know.The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until its too late.Oh yes, so grand the illusion of their freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves.When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them.This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion.When our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin.Their minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from time immemorial.But if they ever find out they are our equal, we shall perish then. THIS THEY MUST NEVER KNOW.If they ever find out that together they can vanquish us, they will take action.They must never, ever find out what we have done, for if they do, we shall have no place to run, for it will be easy to see who we are once the veil has fallen. Our actions will have revealed who we are and they will hunt us down and no person shall give us shelter.This is the secret covenant by which we shall live the rest of our present and future lives, for this reality will transcend many generations and life spans.This covenant is sealed by blood, our blood. We, the ones who from heaven to earth came.This covenant must NEVER, EVER be known to exist. It must NEVER, EVER be written or spoken of for if it is, the consciousness it will spawn will release the fury of the PRIME CREATOR upon us and we shall be cast to the depths from whence we came and remain there until the end time of infinity itself.

I was just lulling your comment over and you know what hit me? The Illuminati symbol: triangle with an eye. Eye represents what you see, triangle represents three. Put them together and you get the [third eye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_eye).Then there's pineal gland calcification, fluoride in water and so on. What do you think?

 

From what I can tell, this flying saucer works by creating an electromagnetic field around the craft such that there is an upwards air pressure on it that counteracts the earth‚Äôs gravitational field, allowing it to hover. And moves this pressure around to make the craft move. Since it uses air, it would not be able to work in space.  But it is an interesting idea that is definitely not impossible. 

Watch the true ruling class be discovered to not even live on earth anymore. 

I agree they are likely just man made. I kinda think the whole alien thing is made up on the governments end.AI is what really worries me. AI can be programmed to take any orders.

It's a mix of both. It's actually a contract between humans and aliens. We give them certain liberties on earth and in exchange we get technologies to develop our own shit. And breakaway civilization is definitely a thing, and there are places for humans to chill on the Moon. 

A thrillion upvotes for Leibniz.

I've recently been reading The Ra Material/Law Of One stuff and have found it very fascinating, enlightening and helpful spiritually and mentally wise, great material to sink your brain into. The Wes Penre papers have been a great read as well, this guy covers alot of stuff that relates to this round table discussion,  he's done some  serious homework Imo. http://wespenre.com/index.htm*Edited for spelling and wording*

[We can return to the source with our consciousness ](https://view.publitas.com/plectic-1/precession-of-the-equinox/page/1) 

Keep spreading the info. Wake the masses up exponentially! Today wake up 1 person, tomorrow you and them wake up 2, the next day 4, the next day 8, and so on and so on. These threads certainly help. I can see humans waking up en masse to the true nature of reality in a mere handful of years.

They can't hold it back forever :).

**The Mechanics of Consciousness:**  Here's some more relevant links which I believe are must-watch/must-reads for diving into the topic.  ["Itzhak Bentov: from Atom to Cosmos"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMbeK_6ATxQ) - a video which starts for the first 20 minutes with an interview between Hubert Jessup and Itzhak Bentov from 1978 on the show "New Heaven New Earth". He explains during this interview the concept of the soul as: "the repository of information that we gather during life" and that the soul uses a 3d body much like a person uses a car to get from one point to another. He says that it isn't the body which evolves, but the soul that does, and that from information gathered during the lives it lives it can evolve and form deeper and more complex understandings of self over time. At one point he uses a diagram to explain the [inherent connection between all people on the soul level](https://imgur.com/a/5Rs4Q), using one line with individual, separate dots on it to represent humans on a 3D level, and then extending out lines upward, likening them to shadows being projected when a light is shone on an object, to represent the extended consciousness of the individuals. The shows that at a point, the next level up on the next line, representing 4D, all the consciousnesses of all individuals overlap and become the same thing, showing how the higher up you go the more the overlap.  The following 1 hour and 20 minutes of the video is comprised of a presentation by Itzhak's wife Mirtala going over and explaining many ideas and concepts Itzhak explored in his books "Stalking the Wild Pendulum" and "A Brief Tour of Higher Consciousness", such as: The Model of Kundalini, Off and On Reality, The Hologram, and A Cosmic Strip - 'Who Runs the Show'.  (Edit: just wanted to add a link to a comment I made the other day on the concept of "levels" oh conscious self in conjuction with each dimension.  https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7xntay/z/dua4wf7)  Another paper, this time from the CIA, ["Analysis and Assessment of the Gateway Process"](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) as part of Project Stargate (/r/ProjectSTARGATE). This paper directly references the work of Itzhak Bentov and the Robert Monroe, utilizing the Monroe Tapes as released by the Monroe Institute for research into biofeedback, out of body experiences, consciousness, kundalini, meditation + transcendental experiences, holographic universe, astral projection, remote viewing, and time travel.  And another video of a lecture from Rupert Sheldrake in 2008 entitled ["The Extended Mind: Recent Experimental Evidence"](https://youtu.be/JnA8GUtXpXY). In this 1 and a half hour talk he gives evidence for and expands upon concepts such as synchronicity and psychic/telepathic connection between events and people. Some examples he explores are the feeling of being watched (such as when you feel like someone's staring at you, and you turn around and someone actually was), thinking about someone you haven't thought about in a long time and then they call you, or thinking about something you haven't done in a while and it pops up in your life very soon after, and the psychic connection between an owner and their pet and how the pet often knows when the owner is coming home from work, even when the owner randomises the times in which they leave work to come home.  I also would recommend the books by Rupert Sheldrake: "Science and Spiritual Practices", and ""Morphic Resonance: The Nature of Formative Causation"  In a similar vein, I also want to include a 2 hour talk from [Dan Winter on DNA, Fractals, and the Golden Ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIzGoLggK1A). Dan Winter has often worked with Nassim Haramein and they've bounced ideas off each other. He's no stranger to the holographic theory and offers some very insightful theories.  Here's a analogy I particularly like to use when talking about the relationship between humans and consciousness:  *"The radio:"*  There's multiple concepts of self. The "self" built up over the accumulation of experiences in life can be referred to as "ego self". It's temporary. "True self/higher self" is awareness, which acts as conscious wave function that the body tunes into, much like a radio tuning into a certain frequency. When the relationship and interaction between the body consciousness and universal consciousness occurs an interference pattern is created and the wave function collapses and forms a relative consciousness experiencing within time.  The functioning human is a symbiotic relationship of hardware (body) and signal (mind), like a functioning radio. The radio needs a power source (batteries/electrical input) just like the human body does (food/water). The radio can be turned on without tuning into a frequency, but that doesn't make it functioning, similarly to how a human can exist on body function alone but without conscious action (like a comatose state). Each radio has its own individual circuit board, speakers, functions etc and all to varying qualities, just like a human has its own bodily functions and systems all to varying degrees of functionality. But they all tune into the same frequency. How it comes out simply varies from radio to radio based on its components and settings, like how consciousness expresses itself differently depending on how the person functions and their respective conditioning. The radio was only invented because radio waves were discovered as an existing phenomena that could be tuned into to and used to communicate information. Similarly to how the human only evolved because conscious awareness existed as a field of potential to tune into and express itself/transfer information.  I like the radio analogy, but it only works so far. The human brain is more like a quantum computer, operating multiple functions simultaneously, whereas a radio has a relatively straight forward and discrete function. So a quantum radio in which multiple functions were occurring simultaneously and where the radio was self-aware would be a more accurate analogy... But for obvious reasons that's not a useful analogy when explaining the concept to those unfamiliar with it.  (This analogy was lifted from a comment I left in a thread the other day which I think had some good discussion in, so [here's the link to that full thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x8eig/the_cias_declassified_research_on_the_human_soul/).)This is not a new concept. [David Icke was talking about this concept back in 1991, and theoretical physicists have since come to the same conclusion as Michio Kaku explains in 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVWWQKU_-G0)

Never heard of this guy, but if he actually measured the masses of protons in grams rather than eV, that alone is super suspect. Interesting idea though. 

 

Why are you equating the proton with the Planck volume? The proton is not an elementary particle, it is a mix of 3 quarks. And even then, elementary particles are not even real, they‚Äôre simply excited states of a universal quantum field. Not totally discounting everything you said, though. The entire universe is just a field of constantly fluctuating energy, so it is totally possible that consciousness is linked in some way to this. One document I read on the cia website stated that we are able to do those special things with our consciousness when we get the field surrounding our neurons into its rest state. Then you like merge with the universal consciousness, which is really just the combined rest state energies of the universe (the energy fluctuations that do NOT give particles). Don‚Äôt have the link handy atm, but I‚Äôve seen it on this sub more than once so maybe someone could help out. It was about the Stargate program I believe, and outlined a lot of their findings from theoretical physics and consciousness experiments. It was listed as a disclosed document from the CIA, so it seems fairly legit. Interesting read. Also had something about someone remote viewing a civilization on Mars, way in the past. So anyways, apparently we‚Äôre able to access a universal consciousness through deep meditation and probably psychedelics. 

Welcome, friend! (Feels rude to call you by your username, lol.) Reddit is a totally crazy online playground. The range of content here is unlike any other. You'll lol so hard reading through the comments on a AskReddit post, and then youll scroll down some more and start crying because of an incredibly heartbreaking story someone shared, followed by your faith in humanity being restored due to all the kind Internet strangers who come together to comfort the redditor who was hurting. It can be a rollercoaster ride for sure. As for this sub? Hold on to your fucking seat, it's going be a wild ride. Keep a mountain of salt grains nearby as you read, and in time you'll become an artist of deciphering bullshit.

the science delusion is a great book on the subject of modern mainstream science being akin to religion thru appeals to a higher authority. except in this case that authority isnt a god but mainstream accepted celebrity scientists.

If interested I've bumped into a few really interesting things, among them a unified theory of physics called "Tetryonics". It's not backed up by handwaving but instead by all currently observed phenomena, including things that classical theories have struggled to explain or outrightly ignore, such as the variable speed of light through mediums, or super luminal information propagation. [This](https://youtu.be/AflICQVeN44) is a video to the legend of the first figure of a project I've been working on based on this... Its purpose is to get people thinking! So it isn't perfect.

Dude....how is this inventions secrecy act not public knowledge. They said over 5,000 inventions in 2007 fall under this act. And it doesn‚Äôt specify what the inventions are. Makes you wonder why it seems like we haven‚Äôt come out with many new types of inventions since the computer, only new ways of looking at old inventions. 

Easier alternative to accomplish what, specifically? Really. I‚Äôd like to answer your question(s) without including things you‚Äôve zero interest in. As for meditation, it occurs in many forms and is much more than the most common perception. It‚Äôs probable you already do it without being aware of it because you didn‚Äôt carve out a block of time and sit down with that as your intention. 

None of that makes it way to me, what the easier alternative? (that's not mediation).

Yup. Just finished the god equation actually. Heavy going..

well despite the machinations of the nwo science does show us that the universe is connected almost in a spiritual buddhist kinda way. think of our planet and  how our brains and hearts are wired. our brains and hearts give off electromagnetic pulses. given that every single human being on earth has their brain and heart pulsing within the medium of our planets electromagnetic field i dont think its much of a stretch to say we're all connected through that. also electrons and photons do wacky things at the planck/quantum scale. they can be in multiple places at once. in some cases electrons can move seemingly instantaneously, faster than light! electrons also behave very similarly to black holes and are subject to the same fundamental properties of mass, charge and spin. as far as a grand unifying theory of everything i stopped searching for one after reading the mathematical universe by max tegmark. amazing book that puts a lot of sooper complex sounding stuff in laymens terms. basically he postulates that everything in the universe is math and as such can be broken down into equations(e=mc^2), numbers(pi, e, i, etc) or values (mass, spin, charge) of some kind. ill def check out the connected universe tho, sounds interesting

Making a point to participate this time. Finally got around to reading the CIA files on the soul and consciousness, only to realize it falls directly in line with realizations made during a remarkably powerful trip. 

It's broad, but I believe they're all much more related than they first appear. Gonna write a bit of an easy on my theories later when I have some time. 

What did u do?

one question: why does this stuff always lead to american media/politics/stuff on tv? actually more questions: Why is it always psychosis/neurosis when that is usually what makes people make these types of stories up? What about the BILLIONS of people here on earth?This assumes there are souls, souls for how many organisms we have just on earth? other plants and even solar systems? Are you sure you aren't actually schizophrenic? 

conciousness is immaterial. 

> interdenominationalLike the Coexist bumper sticker?  ;)

‚ÄúThey are no doubt interdimensional‚Äù. I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs some doubt, considering our concept of other ‚Äòdimensions‚Äô is only founded on only one possible explanation from the findings of quantum mechanics, that is the most ‚Äúfar out there‚Äù of the there‚Äôs popular interpretations. 

... never thought of it this way

Brilliant interview, thanks for the circuit.

There are actually a number of videos on Youtube of people practicing telekinesis and showing off various powers. In the modern day and age, there is no way to vouch that such things are not created through CGI or other forms of video manipulation. Thus eveyone and their mother can go and call it fake.Is some of it likely fake? Sure. Is all of it? I doubt it.Throughout history there have been plenty of people that are said to have had miracolous powers to shape the holographic reality around them. Out of the more well known ones, I could simply mention Jesus or the Buddha. People will say their miracles are myths and legends. Yet who is to say they were not reality?These are extreme examples, but if you want small time miracles like bending spoons... there are plenty of people that have done it, as well as videos that exist of it. Uri Geller was one of those that was more well known in this field. All of these could and many times were called fake, but whether they actually are, or whether this is only propaganda smeared on their name is a question we should all ponder.Ultimately,  if someone could truly perform masive miracles, they would likely not do it public.  This is simply because doing such things is pointless. Performing miracles for a public that is not ready to see them is a bad idea. This is especially the case when it comes from a place of ego - and know that ego, self -importance, pride and a feeling of superiority are the greatest obstacles to performing miracles in the first place. By performing them, you would simply be boosting your own ego and thus lower your spiritual power and prowess as you would do so.Not to mention that unless you were truly Goku level powerful, performing miracles in public and claiming yourself as a Godlike being could easily get you lynched. Have you seen the X-Men movies? Even the humans in those movies with unbelievable powers cannot simply express them without fear of some retribution from the powers that be and without being labeled a "mutant" or even a "demon" by the ignorant public.Spirituality never is and never was about performing miracles. Yes, molding your holographic reality is a part of it, but doing so in our world,  where nobody is ready for this, is literally toying with people (that is to say, unless you intuitively know that you should perform such acts, intuition is the inner and cosmic guidance system that will tell you what to do qnd what not do - as well as what is safe and appropriate to do on our planet) .But ultimately spirituality is about being free and knowing your intertwinement and unity with Source/Life or God. The moment you start performing miracles from a place of ego, you are no longer under the protection of God or Life, because you have decided to use the power given to you irresponsibly, without heeding factthat you should never simply unwittingly perform miracles for a populace that is so deeply asleep and doesn't desire to be jolted awake into a crazy reality beyond their imagination. They like being asleep and  until the collective wakes up, who are you or I to jolt them awake? They need tiny nudges here and there, compassion and love - and even then they must be ready for the ride.I myself have experienced various things that many could label miraculous. Feeling my body as pure energy, knowing myself as the being, consciousness and freedom beyond the body and mind, experiencing the ability to step into another's biofield and read their thoughts, feel their feelings (this is nothing special or new, many psychics and energy therapists do this all the time, some of them are of course charlatans, but they only give a bad name to those that truly can help in such a way - ultimately though if you are very aware, you will see that everyone does this to some degree, people read each other's minds and emotions all the time, yet they assume this is only related to the physical realm of reading bodylanguage,  vocal tonality ....when it is far beyond that and can be evolved far beyond that) - as well as having people do the same to me (which was all done in the form of therapy,  that greatly helped me in regaining my physical and mental well-being after a deep dive into hell many  years ago).Ultimately, you will have to experience these "miracles" for yourself. Practice meditation, introspect, look into various spiritual practices and intuitively choose what you feel will guide you to freedom. You can and you have to do it yourself, for it is your personal journey, as much as it is at the same time the collective journey of all of us.For some wonderful and almost unbelievable examples of miracles, or Siddhis, as they are called in the east, check out the book 'Autobiography of a Yogi', by Yogananda. It is one of the most well known spiritual pieces of literature and likely the most known spiritual autobiography to date. From people becoming invisible, materializing their bodies miles away, even creating buildings out of thin air.... the stuff in that book is just something else.  But in a holographic Universe, none of this is really a miracle. Only to us, at this point of our evolution. Yogananda writes in a very loving, amusing, fun, even humorous fashion, so the book flows easily. The various miracles aren't really the main focus of the book either, they are simply parts of stories here and there, after all this is supposed to be an autobiography,  not a book that proves or wishes to prove miraculous happenings. If you choose to believe the parts of its contents that seem para-normal to us, as fact or fiction is ultimately up to you.Either way good luck on your future journey and much love to you and all reading this.

It is true, but it isn‚Äôt X-men style telekinesis!  TBH, the most information you will find is actually about the *negative uses* of this effect.  Read about how psychopaths manipulate people or how charismatic cult leaders recruit followers.  This is manipulation of reality, but you must understand that a person‚Äôs *perception of reality is reality*.  Generally, the negative uses, which are the simpler order, do so by *subtraction*.  That is, removing complexity or conflicting views from a discussion to the point that the target internalizes this subtraction.  Examples are propaganda from the media, political campaigns, con artists, and even people who make conspiracy theories!The basic way this works is to present an answer for the complex and difficult to understand things about the world in a reductive and simplistic way by removing from discussion anything which would bring this answer under scrutiny.  (‚ÄúRussian bots‚Äù or ‚Äúpaid shills‚Äù are a contemporary and relevant example of how this in practice).  It allows the target to make judgements on *simple* criteria which appeal due to the simplicity and comprehensiveness of the reality which the manipulator creates for them.  ‚ÄúThere is an NWO which controls all nations and hides tech and does *everything* under a grand design for domination.‚Äù  Is much more comprehensible, and understandable, thus actionable as the basis for a belief system than ‚ÄúGlobal politics and events are shaped by millions of self-interested people and groups and most of the time one doesn‚Äôt know what another is doing and often doesn‚Äôt even fully understand what they themselves are doing, and it is more amazing that a cohesive system manages to exist from this chaos and turmoil at all.‚ÄùThe first statement uses subtractive manipulation of reality to provide a simple answer and is thus attractive to people.  When they internalize this belief, they begin to reinforce it by interpreting all future events within this belief system and thus acting on that judgement.  The perception of reality has *become* reality!One can also manipulate reality for more altruistic ends in similar manners and more complex ones.  The basic idea is that he person who wants to ‚Äúshape reality‚Äù must craft a *vision of reality* which others wish to enter and share.  Think about Jesus or Buddha or even Elon Musk.  They all present visions of reality for (mostly) non-malicious purposes which people find attractive and so abandon their own perceptions of it to adopt the one presented.

Here's how it works.1) the multiverse is real. Not only is the universe infinitely large and small, its also infinitely "wide"2) every time determinism splits with an equal probability, so too does the universe3) you are conscious of only the current universe4) but you can hop on to the other universes each time a split happens5) think of "you" as merely the guy viewing the tv behind your eyes and you can switch channels6) this only works gradually and logically, you can't just imagine you'll have wings and voila. As per (4) each shift can only happen when it's just as likely for either result to occur.You can completely disagree, but that just means you'll randomly go along with each split randomly and live a life of random success/failures.On the other hand, you can believe you really do control your fate and move the needle in your favour every chance you recognize you have a choice.This, my friends, is how freewill works in a completely deterministic universe.I personally believe that this is why my mother somehow ended up living an extra year and saw my daughter be born before she finally passed on.  But more practically, this is also why I've got a successful career, because every time I felt like slacking off I decided NOT to live in the universe where I did. That universe does exist out there, but I'm glad I'm not tuned into it.The shifts aren't a physical action, they're completely mental. Think about this. Move your hand on your head. Did your brain first have to decide to do that or did your hand just do it? You shifted your universe into the one where your hand is now on your head. Think about this deeply. Consciousness is merely witnessing your choices. You don't control your body, just the channel you're viewing..So now some are probably about to ask why bad stuff happens to us, if we control reality. Easy. We DON'T CONTROL REALITY.  I never once said we did. Anyway you look at it, we're just along for the ride. The only control we have is when the odds are 50/50 for things to go one way or another. If the odds are 80/20 that something bad will happen, something bad is almost certainly going to happen. But when it does, keep your eyes open even then, as the 50/50 options are even more abundant in the midst of a crisis if you can only keep your wits and emotions in check. 

You see people shaping reality every day. You are shaping your every day, by yourself. Through your actions and your being. Or not?

Have a DMT breakthrough sometime and you'll start believing in the power of us all to do truly extraordinary things.

I don't think it's shaping reality as in making an object fly, but more so controlling where you go in life and attracting things into your life. 

He said collective. It takes all of us to shape reality possibly. 

Your favorite musician or author or director HAS shaped your reality. What would your reality look like without them? 

The reality you are creating before you will not allow you to see someone breaking rules that you hold to be true. Basically, you're not letting your reality's "rules" be broken because it's not relevant/logical to you.... Yet ;)

Shaping reality in this sense isn‚Äôt a spontaneous occurrence. There‚Äôs a saying that goes something like‚Äùif you did it right, no one will know you did anything at all.‚Äù It‚Äôs a subtle change that manifests. It‚Äôs luck, chance, unlikely outcomes, overcoming the odds, etc. It doesn‚Äôt mean you can grow a tree with your mind. It just means you can influence the word you live in through sheer will and brain power. 

Just wanted to pop in with a comment on this. I once heard a story about natives standing on the shore, unable to see the approaching invading ships because their minds had nothing to reference the image against. Who's to say that you haven't ALREADY seen someone shape reality, but your mind justified it away. How many times have you seen something and couldn't make it out until enough information became available and then BAM the image snaps into focus? I personally believe that I affect my reality constantly, but in ways that most wouldn't notice. Small things, like transmuting a shitty situation into a gain. Some might think it was just good timing and planning, but in reality its a lot simpler than that. 

I think the issue is that given specific thinking, or knowledge, you can do really crazy stuff, for example create a bacteria which generates a particular reaction after X amount of time, this bacteria would be encoded in DNA that is made of atoms, which are themselves standing 3D waves of energy. So if you can move energy intelligently from point A to point B instantly, it opens up a lot of possibilities. Can you engineer a fleet of comets into something living? And i think those type of questions can very quickly appear "godlike" but on the surface appear mundane

This is why I wanted a new thread on the multitude Mind Experiments from the CIA and other agencies to be discussed next. Some of the stuff in the released docs is mind blowing. I am a believer in something out there, especially after my experiences with DMT. The one thing that really flipped me out on it was when 2 of the people I was with the last time I used it met each other in their "trip". 

From my perspective. we do this already. We can't know what a reality outside of the way we experience time would look like, But if we could look at a persons life as pages in a book all visible at once then we would clearly see a person "manipulating reality". Just because you haven't seen someone materialize something in front of you doesn't mean we aren't moving, manipulating, and creating everything as we go. It's just hard for the individual to see the long game. It has been for me anyways..

You're thinking about it far too literally I think. Shaping your own reality can simply be the power to get yourself out of bed and smile at someone as you walk down the street. Those positive interactions create ripple effects that can have consequences far beyond what you ever be able to measure - even if those consequences might seem relatively small and insignificant in the present moment. I think we'd all like a world where we can move mountains just by willing it, but to get to that point (if it's actually possible) requires a foundational understanding of how you practice your own abilities on yourself. It starts with getting a handle on how you react to your own emotions. The easiest example is someone cutting you off in traffic. In that moment you are flooded with emotion and your next move is really just a reflection of what type of "spell" you're casting on yourself. A bad spell would lead to anger and frustration whereas a positive spell would lead to complete ambivalence. The magick that is often talked about can be translated to psychological language as well.Shaping your reality means identifying something that you'd like to do or change and having the mental ability and energy to actually make it happen.

You do it all the time without even realizing it though. 

I asked the universe for a Fox to appear. I live in an area were there are foxes but I never really see them.  Two weeks later behind the 15th green a fox was just chilling out looking at me, not scared and never moved.  Probably a coincidence,  but it was cool I gotta try it again soon.       The only videos were I went WTF is that asian healer dude someone posted [Chi master Dynamo Jack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzHUTdiqKgQ)

The first step to free yourself from this trap is to *fully understand and accept* that there is no truth, the entire manipulation is based on making people *think that there is a truth and that it is being withheld from them*.  When one realizes that the Egyptian priest class had no more knowledge about the Gods than the average slave (or that a politician knows no more about the whole system than you do) suddenly their vast power is rendered into human frailty, and their motives are equally understandable by mundane human desires.The illusion of a secret truth is the core of the deception, the heart of the con.  For them to have true power over you, you must believe that they have access to truths which you do not.  This is the *secret knowledge* of the Mystery Schools; they are exactly the same as Scientology!  *This* is what is revealed at the highest levels!  That there *is no Wizard of Oz* just a man behind a curtain and all the rituals and pretense are part of the deception.  The reason it is sounds boring and almost false to you now, is because the initiate of the mystery school who reaches that level and has that revealed to them *has spent their lives* believing the con and watching it employed on others and so has a *visceral understanding* of this power rather than an outsider thinking ‚ÄúSo it is all a lie? How disappointing!‚Äù  The initiate has the understanding of how to *employ* this knowledge.

You do shape the world by thinking!  Just not on an empirically understandable way, it is just one more force in a system of infinite complexity.You have surely, at some point, seen studies where brainwaves are measured with electrodes, right?  Well, consider that... if a sensor can measure the electrical activity of the mind, then clearly that electrical activity, however slight, has an effect on the world outside of one‚Äôs skull.  Through butterfly effects of chain reactions, mere thoughts *do indeed* shape reality.This is fact, not magic.  If the mind did not affect reality, MEG and EEG would not be possible.https://psychcentral.com/lib/types-of-brain-imaging-techniques/

With respect brother I disagree. The more I read into it the more karma seems like a debt system created to trap us. Karma means something is owed, but owed to whom? Each other? If forgiveness is a virtue no one owes anyone else anything. Additionally read into myths about mystics of the past who could create buildings of stone out of thought. I believe we very much are magicians wrapped up in illusion as you said, the whole point of this society has been to convince us otherwise to the point where this notion is so ridiculous to most of us that we could never accept that it isn't the case. Our own thoughts and beliefs define the reality around us and for almost all of us that reality is that we are purely physical creatures who can do nothing but daydream. 

thought creates 

The only way to move yourself into action is by thinking. So yes, thought does shape reality.

Escaping karma sounds alot like "The cremation of care". The ruling class are ahead of us it seems..

He may have a point to an extent think of psychosomatic processes in our bodies. People have literally thought that they were sick or take a sugar pill and depending on the former their bodies might mimic some of its own symptoms and the latter with people being relieved of some symptoms of an ailment they may have even if temporarily.

Makes absolute sense to me. I have a feeling that once we get to the point where reality can be altered in a perceivable way to others in a way where you could 'show off', that showing off like that is no longer on your list of priorities. I think that ego centric thinking is a huge roadblock to doing stuff like that.Edit: In terms of the shared reality aspect I could go into great length about that. I think that altering the reality of another requires their consent, in that they have to believe you can. A good example, the reason the wealthy elite always seem to win is because everyone thinks that's reality. We think that's the way it should be, which allows them to manifest reality in that way.

I have yet to see anything about "proper training" other than talk of such. I am interested in this topic and I have had experiences throughout my life which lead me towards believing in this stuff but everybody keeps talking about how it's definitely possible and how this and that person has written a book about it but they never say how to at least start on your path to fully understanding and delving into it.

*Tantra Illuminated* by Christopher Wallis is a good start for fundamentals of consciousness. In fact old Hinduism is a good place to begin looking into the subject. But unfortunately there isn't one particular book, just a general area you have to start looking into. I will say that the subreddit r/Echerdex is a terrific source of knowledge for the beginning of a spiritual journey, have a look there and see if it sparks your interest :).The law of one series is also incredibly interesting on this matter.

I strongly recommend "Not in HIS Image" by John Lash.

"Thinking and Destiny" is a great read about the reality we humans find ourselves in.

Read the Ra material, Law of One transcripts. 

Check out "DMT: The Spirit Molecule" by Rick Strassman and "The Invisible Landscape" by Terence and Dennis McKenna.

Tantric Hinduism is a good start. It's not all just sex stuff like the media would have you believe it's about the fundamentals of consciousness. There is a religious twist to it of course but it's easy enough to read between the lines. Another source I highly recommend is the Law of One books. Go into it with a cautiously skeptical outlook but read it and see what you make of it. 

>forumated on an incorrect notionWith all due respect mate, you cannot make that call. In fact the entire point of what I was saying is that society has been twisted so we think precisely the way you do.  If you have never seen or experienced anything that makes you believe humans can alter reality around them then that is very understandable, but some of us have. Please don't take this as a personal attack, I'm more just pointing out that this is not something you can be certain about at all. And keeping your mind closed about it like that is the goal of TPTB. 

There's a lot of evidence of occult shit going down in Little Rock where her and Bill are from. Apparently energic leylines also pass through there. I would argue she is very aware of it but like I said it's still a shared reality and you can't always have it your way ;). 

Julian Assange put a stop to her reality.But it couldn't have happened without a *hero's journey*.http://www.movieoutline.com/articles/the-hero-journey-mythic-structure-of-joseph-campbell-monomyth.html

Where does this come from? 

I think there is definitely a deliberate and concentrated campaign to weaken that aspect of the human being. 

the latest in a long line of efforts to suppress global paradigm shifting technology. the downvotes MUST mean im on to somethin lol the thread i made keeps fluctuating the votes. everytime i look at it its a different number between 6 and 9. smells like botwork

it could still get you to space ,and around earth, easier and cheaper than a rocket. if it works scaled up that is. conventional thrusters or an ion engine (ion engines and ion thrusters are different) could power it in space. solar sail maybe? 

at what point do they stop caring about ruling us altogether and simply just exist as their own separate civilization? theyd probably get some ego kicks out of being able to classify themselves a new species after however many generations.

AI can be programmed to order like in tron 2 lol

my thing is, if this technology is so simple, why are people not working on it independently of their govt? like on a local community level. theoretically i should be able to buy a neon sign transformer, some hunks of aluminum/copper and some clay and be able to atleast test this stuff. alas i am a broke bastard but surely there are people with more disposable income than i to work with. i mean no aliens any harm but i definitely didnt sign no damn contract lol

lol sweet, i should've checked this sub out earlier.  honestly, a lot of his stuff is kind of hard for me to understand, and i really looked into his monadology mostly.  but i've read that almost everything he put out was consistent with his own philosophy, which he basically started from scratch.  might explain why his ideas seem to tie together really elegantly.  what ideas of his were you into?

hah.  i heard the idea the there's just one electron in all the universe with infinite speed, and it's hard to completely dismiss...

Or quantum physicists 

**Religion:**  I've never really been devoutly religious myself. I went to a Church of England primary school from ages 5-11, so I had a decent education in Christianity, but it never really "stuck" with me. I considered myself an atheist for the most part of my life. It wasn't until I discovered Buddhism and general eastern philosophy that I begun exploring that aspect of religion a few years ago. The concept of reincarnation seemed far more realistic than either eternal bliss or eternal damnation, and the concept of simply *nothing* at death didn't seem right. I strongly considered it for a while, but when I really thought about it and thought, "Well, if all of this is just meaningless then why don't I just go round killing everyone who makes my life difficult? ...Well because I don't *want* to do that. It's not right. It doesn't make me happy. I might as well just try to make the most for myself and others while I am here because that seems to be the most logical in any case." Then came the whole considering that when I die my body would just decompose and become the earth itself, so therefore my mind would probably decompose in the same way, just becoming the consciousness of the earth, the plants, the water etc... not in the self-aware way of a human mind, but rather in that inherent knowing way that things just seem to know what to do. A plant knows which way to water and light. Water knows to evaporate and condense in conjuction with temperature changes. Just like my body knows to beat pump the blood, and digest food, and convert oxygen to carbon dioxide without my thinking of it. That seemed settling. And that seemed to be what I was taking from Buddhist philosophy. That we just return to the environment and universal consciousness in that way.  But then over time I started reading into conscious theories such as Nassim Haramein's, among a plethora of other information from random youtube videos and reddit posts, and it made me take a second look at it all in a new light. While at first I thought the whole "planes of existence" part of Buddhism was purely metaphorical on a personal mental level, it made me reevaluate that thought to consider them metaphors for, or likenings to, actual other physical/astral planes of existence.  And then I had my first (and so far only) astral projection. I'd been practicing lucid dreaming, and wanted to see if astral projection actually had anything real to it or if it was just some form of lucid dreaming... It's not some form of lucid dreaming. It's very real. I had practiced a classic technique for a few weeks, attempting it ~4 times a week on average, and after a month or two i finally got past the "vibration stage" to the point where I felt like I got physically thrown out of my body and I found myself floating above my body in my room. I freaked out, then it felt like I got yanked back into my body as if by a rope being pulled. I sat up in shock, took a few seconds to consider what just happened, and when I came to the conclusion that all of that "nonsense" I'd been watching on youtube was actually real, well that was simply enough for me in terms of practicing astral projection. I realised it was real, and from there just decided to learn more about how it all works instead of continuing practicing it. I figured that if some spirit part of me can exist outside of my physical body then that's probably the base function of me and that this physical thing was the temporary part, so I should make the most of learning more as a physical body.  I learned that the concept of multiple planes of existence was very prevalent in eastern philosophy, and that karma tended to govern where the spirit goes between lives. I learned that "higher planes" were associated with more interconnectedness, and "lower planes" were associated with more disconnectedness. And as I was learning more of the holographic theory at the same time as this all the puzzle pieces started to fall together. It's all metaphor for a holographic universe! This sent me down the pantheistic route: the idea that all religions are talking about the same thing - the same universal truth - but that over time it got warped and twisted and metaphor was used to explain abstract concepts, and that over all this time the metaphor got misinterpreted as the answer itself instead of the method to getting there.  Here's a good page with some interesting reading: ["Hinduism & Quantum Physics" - The Hologram, Transcendental Meditation, Vedanta and the Synthesis of Science and Religion](http://www.hinduism.co.za/hinduism.htm)  Also here's some quote from Einstein on Buddhism I came across and liked in my research:  "The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description. If there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism."  "Among the founders of all religions in this world, I respect only one man ‚Äî the Buddha. The main reason was that the Buddha did not make statements regarding the origin of the world. The Buddha was the only teacher who realised the true nature of the world.‚Äù  "A human being is part of the whole, called by us ‚ÄòUniverse‚Äô; a part limited in time and space.  He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest ‚Äì a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.  This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and affection for a few persons nearest us.  Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty.  Nobody is able to achieve this completely but striving for such achievement is, in itself, a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.‚Äù  15 minute video: ["Carl Sagan on how Hindu culture is the basis for cosmic theories"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGJxoYPy4OI)  This truth seemed much more apparent in eastern religion than in western and Abrahamic religions. But alas, I did further research. I learned of the origins of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam and how very similar they were in expressions. I was still at first off-put by the patriarchal/hierarchical structure they seemed to impose on their followers, and by factthat they have priests who act as middlemen between the regular person and the truth. I then considered that this was by design. A corruption of the truth, in order to control the flow of information. A conspiracy (duh!).  I did some re-reading on Jesus' teachings and there was one quote that really stuck with me:  Luke 17:21 - "The kingdom of God will not come with observable signs. 21Nor will people say, ‚ÄòLook, here it is,‚Äô or ‚ÄòThere it is.‚Äô For you see, the kingdom of God is in your midst."  This seemed to me like a direct reference to the holographic nature of the proton. Like DNA. The information of the whole being available at every point. All you have to do is look internally to seek the answers to the cosmos. And this new revelation (pardon the pun) of Jesus' teachings and the rest of the bible came with the discovery of the variety of ideas and philosophy that came to be known as Gnosticism. And that led me down to Knights Templar, Freemasonry, and... yeah that's a whole 'nother rabbit hole for another post.  Here's a decent [forum thread that analyses some Bible quotes](http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread979829/pg1) with some videos to go along explaining them in the light of holographic theory.  And here's a BBC Documentary just 50 minutes long: ["Jesus Christ was a Buddhist Monk"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY0Ib3aPG6Y)  

Not measured, but calculated. It's all theoretical of course, but utilising geometry and the holographic principle, addressing the problem from a different angle, he's managed to simplify the equations.  The top stickied post in the holofractal sub and the lecture I linked explain it in more detail. 

The proton has been solved for, and recently - the electron has been solved for using the same equation, [here](https://resonance.is/wp-content/uploads/EHM_30.pdf).>What is a "spherical unit of energy"? Energy does exist by itself like thatWell, there are a few ways to think about this. The mainstream has the notion of a [planck particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_particle).However, a spherical unit of energy - field energy that is massive enough to keep itself gravitationally together has been hypothesized for a while - this is the 'mass without mass' concept of John Wheeler.The spheres are [geons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geon_(physics\)) - an electromagnetic or gravitational wave which is held together in a confined region by the gravitational attraction of its own field energy.

I'm just giving the best Eli5 I can here. Please read some of the links I provided or visit the /r/holofractal subreddit for information that goes into further detail. The fractal-holographic theory isn't my own, so I'm not the best resource to explain it in its entirety. There are more qualified people than me who can do it much better. 

I'm also curious about the weak nuclear force and interaction of quarks within hadrons. I'm not sure about that yet myself.  Paging /u/d8_thc - have you got any links you might be able to share in regards to this? Thank you! (also, side note: sorry I haven't made that post yet, mate. Been a busy week. I'll actually get on it this weekend haha)  But yeah, /u/PackaBowllio28, I've also read those CIA documents! Very interesting stuff! The methods of transcendental experience seem to resonate very much with those described by Buddhist monks, Hindu yogis, and the like, which I go into a bit later on this post. Thanks for the input though, I appreciate it! 

We thank you for the warm welcome!  Reddit is like a really cool playground for your brain.  Pretty awesome!!!  

you summed it up very well friend

I learned about it few months back from an obscure foreign language blog.

I had a short meditation the other day, of multiple dimensions or layers of myself. I was simply standing at work, been very tired lately, and felt awareness of higher and lower representations of self. Cant be exactly put into words easily.Back in the day i did some potent shrooms. It was maybe 2-2.5 hours after taking them, and i left a friends house to walk to my place only two blocks away.This was in a forest town outside of Seattle... As i walked under a tree it felt like another entity or intelligence. It frightened me because i could feel that the being in the tree seemed surprised that i noticed it. I tried to think of something else, but this entity made me experience my craziest trip, and i felt aware of other layers of reality with different looking creatures controlling what seemed like gears and machinery. Very interesting night that opened my mind. Meditation is more important than drugs.

Yeah that's what the mystics and yogis set out to achieve.  Psyches I feel just make it easier for the common man to get a look into that kind perception.Seriously, I don't feel like people are understanding the gravity of the situation if it turns out that aliens are in cahoots with the guberment.If that it is indeed the case, everything we have come to understand is out the window.Personally, I think they just landed here long ago and interjected some of their DNA into ours and have us working for them.  They are always watching tho :I

watch Terrence McKenna lectures on repeathe's like a walking Cliff Notes on the psychedelic experience and the lessons / questions to be asked from it edit: words

awesome.  i think i remember some of that.  i listened to anything available in audiobook form on youtube (most of them in a robotic australian female's voice).  i think i'll try again right now.so what's your general take on mike hockney?  and related ideas--meritocracy, illuminism, whatever, anything really.  even if they're way off, they're so fun to think about XD

> as far as a grand unifying theory of everything i stopped searching for one after reading the mathematical universe by max tegmark. amazing book that puts a lot of sooper complex sounding stuff in laymens terms. basically he postulates that everything in the universe is math and as such can be broken down into equations(e=mc2), numbers(pi, e, i, etc) or values (mass, spin, charge) of some kind.is that...not the entire basis of physics?

Odd. I'll chalk that one as Reddit acting up since idk if accounts can be temporarily unactivated. Edit: Account is active, must be the link in OP that doesn't work for some reason.

indeed! fixed!!

hi my first round table here. is this not happening now? no ones posting anything lol forgive my n00bness

i thought he literally kicked a hornet‚Äôs nest lol 

yea what?

Had an angry wank.

lol, haha damn autocorrect

of course! That's just my guess

Beautiful point of view. Truly powerful.

Excellently said mate, and I will definitely be tracking that book down :). 

!!

I heard Alan Watts say something to the affect of this once, and it changed my opinion of a lot of things simultaneously. "Can you imagine how Jesus must have felt? People bowing at his feet and bringing him gifts of all kinds... knowing that they had it within themselves to do the same, since the kingdom of God was truly WITHIN. He told them this, he railed against the status quo and tried to show the people around him what they themselves might be capable of, and they thought he was some kind of God, worthy of admiration and devotion." Talk about a face palm situation.. "Hey dudes, if you practice meditation, virtue, and awareness, you can turn water into wine too!" What do they do? Bow down and show that they totally missed the point in a painfully obvious kind of way.

Thank you so much - I will read that book for certain.  I would be interested in the type of therapy you had if you don't mind sharing more about it.

> There are actually a number of videos on Youtube of people practicing telekinesis and showing off various powers.Where?

 

 

That really is a very good book and does explain these questions very scientifically and rationally. 

When your argument contains the phrase "have you seen the xmen movies?" It is no longer valid. Lol

Take out any mention of Uri Geller and you‚Äôd be better off, he‚Äôs a pretty clear fraud

 

Yes! You are the winner. Your explanation is not wrapped in superfluous neon plastic with promises of money back guarantees and elevated status in the race to acquire more STUFF...you may not get much attn...I luv ya tho 

like fingers realising they are part of a hand and to just flow positively and that

I favor the perspective that all is truth, I am a pluralist, this stems from the idea that from the individual perspective of every person all that occurs in the mind is truth, all experience is truth. Even when you think you are wrong or something is not true, you must hold that conclusion as truth, so I believe your perspective that there is no truth, as being truthful. Another way to free yourself from mental traps is to accept the paradoxical nature of mentalism and the limits inherent to the constructs of the human mind. The higher dimensions/densities of spiritual nature offer more complete explanations, it just doesn't make any sense from a physical or mental perspective as to why our existence operates the way it does. 

There is Truth, but it can't be witnessed from the confines of the ego. 

Great insight. I for one believe that the universe is large enough and malleable enough to accommodate all of our truths. We are, in a sense, universes onto ourselves, so what really matters is our truth (as long as we don't hurt anyone in the process). 

 

> *Karma means something is owed, but owed to whom?*Karma is literally just another name for cause and effect; not some kind of "debt system."

 

It doesn't tho.  It shapes perspective which is how we view our reality, not how reality exists, and the only direct causation of perspective effecting reality is quantum perspective matter change.

That's some really pointless semantic bullshit.

 

Only through years of meditation can you ever hope to begin to understand. I only know what I know through DMT. 

thanks - i'll check it out!

I didn't write it. Found it on the Chans

I think that Reddit obfuscates the exact karma value of posts (probably part of why they now only give a single karma value instead of seperate up and down vote totals)  If you look at the karma value of just about any post and refresh it a number of times the karma value will keep changing like you said.

Nigga I have no idea. While I don't think we are at that point just yet, I think we will be within the next 20 years 

I mean so much of what he came out with was gold. He was like the easter bunny of baller metaphysical ideas. Probably my favourite polymath. Wrestled down things like god, infinity and the square root of -1 like a boss.The monadology for sure tops the list. I really dig the whole compossibility idea too.I like this notion there's a constant battle just outside of reality amongst all the things and non-things trying to win existence in this realm. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compossibility

**The Occult:**  Magick -  We can't exactly talk about the occult, and subsequently magick, without talking about Aleister Crowley. No matter your opinion on him, he really brought magick somewhat into the mainstream of modern day. Crowley defined Magick as: "The manifestation of ones will into reality", and, "magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will." Crowley also wrote, "it is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature."  I won't go too much into the obvious implications of magick on a physical level, because I believe /u/bradok did a very good concise breakdown of that in [their post the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7xdss5/magick_and_the_occult/), with some good links to go along with it.  It's broad, and literally comes to classify things like normal gestures of conscious action as magick, but on a deeper level one has to wonder what Crowley knew about the true nature of reality. Yes, it's possible to move an object from A to B through physical means and call it magick, as it was in conformity with will... But what if one were to use conscious techniques that weren't merely applications of complex forms of consciousness (matter), but went directly back to the source?  *Psychokinesis:*  Theoretically, since one can project their own relative consciousness back up dimensional levels toward the universal source consciousness via techniques like astral projection and transcendental meditation, could one then change physical reality from there? One would suppose so if the will and intention is strong enough.  There have been plenty of stories and reports of individuals being able to move things with their minds, and influence reality from afar. A lot tend to come from monks and shamans who claim to have practiced these techniques for years... And that's likely the secret! Of course a regular person like you or I wouldn't be able to use any sort of telekenetic/telepathic powers. We haven't practiced for long enough with the right knowledge of how it works and which techniques to use. Sure, we could take a stab in the dark and maybe get something out of it 1 in a few hundred times, but nothing significant. I'm reminded of that scene in Doctor Strange when Stephen just learns about magic:  Dr. Stephen Strange: How do I get from here to there?  The Ancient One: How did you get to reattach severed nerves and put a human spine back together bone by bone?  Dr. Stephen Strange: Study and practice. Years of it.  Crowley was no stranger to secret societies, such as the Order of the Golden Dawn, Ordo Templi Orientis. Secret societies are renowned for practicing and sharing gnostic teachings within their ranks. So besides regular physical manipulation of reality, and source manipulation of reality, what other methods could be possible?  *Symbols & Sigils:*Symbols represent fundamental conscious forces, mechanics, and laws of the universe. Spiritual and occult symbology may be the most "pure" or "true to nature" of symbols, but even symbols that are invented by man and then prescribed meanings can hold genuine weight to them so long as the intention that went into their creation and use was strong.  Sociology after all is applied psychology, and psychology is applied biology, biology is applied chemistry, chemistry is applied physics, physics is applied mathematics, and all mathematics arises from geometry, which is what this universe is based in. On the most basic level, the very fabric of the universe is simply conscious energy acting through vectors of force. (see /r/Echerdex)  If you create a symbol that naturally resonates with the fundamental mechanics of the universe then that symbols will generally interact with the world in the way of the mechanic that it naturally represents (for example: [Flower of life](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ohkKg.png) = unity of all things. [Yin & yang](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Yin_and_Yang.svg/1024px-Yin_and_Yang.svg.png) = harmonisation of duality. [Pentagram/Pentacle](https://themagickalpen.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo.png) = self-support/strength/protection against evil). These symbols can however be co-opted, subverted, or inverted etc to change or oppose the original meaning (for example: the inverted pentagram, or the swastika). They always have impact - be it either immediately conscious, or subconscious - but generally the significance of its impact is governed by the strength of the intent in the symbols creation and use.Furthermore, if one were to create a symbol for a specific use (let's take the infamous ["boy lover"](https://fiercetruthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/pizzagate-pedophile-logos.jpg?w=482&h=450) spiraling blue triangle symbol for example) then for it to have an impact the creators and users would have to always apply it and attribute it to that particular use. They'd draw it on the walls when performing the darkest acts of child abuse, and stick it everywhere they go like a graffiti tag, always thinking about and acknowledging the specific meaning every time they see it. And those who had been abused would also think about those same experiences later on when they see the symbol. It may not have an immediate conscious impact on those who don't know the symbols meaning, but it would have an eventual subconscious impact with prolonged exposure. Analysing it, you could attribute certain meanings to the shape and different aspects of it. The spiraling could represent fractality and recursion, like how the abused often become abusers themselves. The triangle can be representative of the all seeing eye. The blue can be representative of boys, as opposed to how pink is to girls. Whether these attributions are intentional, subconscious, or simply synchronistic, one can only speculate.But all-in-all it just goes to show the power these symbols can have. So stay mindful when using and acknowledging symbols, and please manifest reality responsibly.  *Rituals:*  Similar process, just a further application. It's all about intent, the strength of that intent, attribution of certain symbols together which carry their own meaning and so forth. It's more complex in mechanics, but often simpler in practice.  

>  This sent me down the pantheistic route: the idea that all religions are talking about the same thing - the same universal truth - but that over time it got warped and twisted and metaphor was used to explain abstract concepts, and that over all this time the metaphor got misinterpreted as the answer itself instead of the method to getting there.Precisely. People have been sharing [mystical experiences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539773/) since time immemorial. Rituals formed around the summoning of these experiences, and cultural metaphors were used to describe the ineffable. Each generation would update the dogma based on their own experience with the Other, rather than on an interpretation of a text. 

Yeah but my point is that any physicist who is working at the quantum level will hardly ever measure mass in terms of grams, they usually convert it into its equivalent form of energy. If the object is at rest in your reference frame then it‚Äôs just E = mc^2. When measuring the mass of a proton, it is customary to use 938 MeV instead of 1.67*10^-27 kg. This doesn‚Äôt completely debunk him, but it makes me doubt exactly how much experience he has in theoretical physics. 

Rick Strassman talks about machine elves and other ambiguous creatures(including clowns) and reptilian/machine in nature in [The Spirit Molecule.](http://www.organiclab.narod.ru/books/DMT-The-spirit-molecule.pdf) Many of the users had similar experiences..and had a hard time even putting them into words. 

I can only speak for the God Equation but I'd be interested in reading at least one of the others to see if the writing style is the same, or if it's more than 1 person doing this. It seems a hell of a lot of output for something that (if you ignore the rants) is pretty next level content-wise. There's like what, 8-10 books or something?I found it because I was looking at Eulers Identity anyways. I went from ancient architecture > interest in geometry > interest in numbers > numbers as reality > waves / harmony / phi > pi > holy shit > poking at eulers identity. But I was only really messing with that because it had all the things I was looking at in there, I didn't really get what any of it meant (in the metaphysical / big picture sense)And the God Equation filled in a lot of those gaps. Or at least coloured them in in a compelling way. It really doesn't feel like a theory someone's just pulled out their ass. Yet at the same time if it was truly from an illuminated source, would it have the almost constant ranting?Definitely one of the stranger things I've read in a while.

well yeah exactly. the universe itself in its entirety is the grand unifying equation made up of the sum of a series of lesser equations that describe it. theres no need to unify it cuz its already all there all around us. we cant possibly write something that complex given our vastly limited knowledge of the universe. from our perspective we can see parts of the universe, string together patterns and add them up but we will never percieve the whole. 

Ours is not to question why I suppose 

Cheers brah! 

No worries, my first as well. I was commuting, and am now at a doctors appointment. Can't speak for everyone else, but I was waiting until I could offer my full attention. 

Hey...you might be right both pre- and post-edit.  Kumbaya space bros.!

Ok good just wanted to clear that up 

You can watch it on Netflix too.. Life of a Yogi. Man had an amazing life. 

Absolutely love Alan Watts.

Here's a popular one I'm aware of  https://youtu.be/3F3ovb2kZ9Q

This is always an interesting debate for me (regarding free will etc.), but I would say that once you are on that level, you are in unity with God, not really a puppet of God per se.In the end, beyond the ego, you ARE God, the indivisible, unfathomable infinite potential Source energy that has individuated itself in so many forms.I would always guard myself against the idea that in the end, me and God are somehow separate. Because if you look it at it from that perspective, then yes, you could say as you become enlightened you become a "puppet of God", but this is only true when seen from the false view that you are ultimately the ego, that you are ultimately separate from that which we could call God. So fundamentally I would say this is not the case. You are a puppet now, a puppet of your limitations. As you awaken you free yourself and you regain your true freedom and free will. Free will is not doing what you want from a place of ego, it is doing what you ultimately want as a slice of God, a cell in the infinite organism of life - where you are both the entire organism and a cell simultaneously. So as these beings regain their awareness of their Godlike nature, they regain their awareness of the fundamental unity, which is the natural state. From there they know who they are and what they truly want, as their deepest, truest self. That in my opinion, is then true free will.Simply my perspective of course :)

It actually specifically says on my book that there have been plenty of reprints and corrections in later editions of the book, but that the book I'm holding in my hand is a reprint of the original version from Yogananda, back from 1946. So I hope they aren't lying and my book indeed is the original version :)

Omg! Thanks!! 

Thanks!   I really wonder why people always connect "shaping reality" with some kind of miracle or mystical happening. There's nothing esoteric about that. We all have the power to shape reality and society. In fact, we do it with every action, whether we want or not, whether we are conscious or not. We often don't realize the opportunities that are there but it has nothing to do with superhuman abilities.

I don‚Äôt make any argument that this is not mostly true also.  If you read more of my posts in this thread you will see that the central idea I am expressing is that there is no objective reality; our perceptions of reality are our reality, and our experience of life is eternity without time, for when we cease to perceive reality, there is nothing at either end, that is eternity.Our thoughts are not as original as we think, whether you label it divinity or the collective unconscious, it is tied to something shared and universal.  You could call it transcending of time because time is not as absolute as is often granted.  Eternity, God, Everything of human experience is both finite and infinite due to the nature of reality being only in the perception of the mind.  This is the riddle or paradox of consciousness.

Read further into the notion of karma. 

 

Nonsense. You wouldn't be able to take any action without thought taking place first. 

That explains why the world doesn't change, all the good people leave it.

DMT? The drug? I'm not interested in any of that. Meditation seems like the key but in today's world it's almost impossible to find the time to maintain something like this without ruining one's day. And there is no comprehensive guide as to any of this that I've seen.

Edit: just went to confirm, went to look at my post history (using mobile app fwiw) my two most recent posts were a week or two ago, so I know that no one is looking at them and voting, if I keep refreshing, the one post bounces between 4 and 6, the other between 78 and 82.*actual edit: guess I replied to my comment instead of editing the original :) lol

ah he's my favorite polymath too!  although i don't know all that many...and damn...did not know he came up with imaginary numbers too O_O, just calculus i thought.yea, the way he deals with god/infinity, zero/souls, etc. like it seems kinda arbitrary at times, but the method he uses is really...seductive?  (i'm not a philosopher, so i have no idea what it's called, but it's like a consistent "all-or-nothing" kind of reasoning.  like if there can be one, then there can be an infinite, otherwise none.  and another similar line of reasoning involving whether something has sufficient reason to exist, or yadda yadda i forget but yea).  anyway, he pulls it off in style somehow, so i thought your use of "baller" was amazingly dead-on.  totally missed compossibility, will check it out now--thanks! :D

**Psychedelics:**  Psilocybin, LSD, Ayahuasca, DMT... Isn't it funny how everyone tends to report the same feelings on these? Connecteness... Seeing past the veil at how it all really works...  Psilocybin has been [scientifically linked](http://reset.me/story/how-psilocybin-improves-your-brain/) with increasing neural pathway interconnectivity, and [increases the number of neural connections](https://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/shrooms1_1024.jpg) in your brain when you are on it. It wires together parts of the brain that aren't usually wired together, allowing you to literally experience more of reality than you usually would.  LSD has a very similar effect, albeit with it's own quirks and characteristics.  *Video interjection!* Here's a 20 minute video with Dead Sea Scroll scholar John Allegro posing the theory that [Jesus Christ was a psychedelic mushroom.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOu9tV6uy2E) Very interesting theory!  DMT and Ayahuasca though... Now there's something that sends you back to the source. Ayahuasca has been used ceremonially for thousands of years in cultures all over the globe. Eaten, drunk, smoked, absorbed through the skin- whatever method is possible has been done at some point or another. But most of us are more familiar with the Shamans of South America. [They take 2 different plants that are found miles apart from each other, sometimes adding other plants for a varying reasons, and put them together to make one of the most powerful natural psychedelic substances on Earth](http://www.singingtotheplants.com/what-is-ayahuasca/). And who told them how to do this? They'll tell you that the trees told them, of course! People often report of a whole process of rebirth on Ayahuasca, along with a total cleansing of body and mind. A lot of people may throw up, shit themselves, cry their eyes out, feel like they die, then become a baby again, then a child, then make their way back to themselves in the end. I could really never do it justice, so here's a great documentary:  [DMT: The Spirit Molecule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT6Xkk-kzk)  And DMT, the pure, refined substance, is most often smoked. DMT users all report a very similar experience. the first toke you star seeing fractals, like LSD visuals, and the connection between things. The second toke and the barrier between you and your environment starts to dissolve. And the third toke... That's when most people report the "breakthrough". Like your own consciousness get shot up a tube across the universe and into another dimension of indescribable emotion and colour. And here's where most people even report talking to other beings. Aliens, reptiles, snakes...  Again though, while I've heard and read plenty, I'm not the guy to be telling you about DMT. Let [Terence McKenna give you a lecture on everything you need to know about DMT](https://youtu.be/yQlRKaw2oSA).  **UFO Tech:**  I saw a ufo once. It was 2 years ago, almost to the day. 14th of February 2015. A set of three orange orbs of light forming an equilateral triangle (could have been a triangular craft, could have been three orbs in formation - it was to dark to tell if there was anything solid to it) came slowly over the sky, about ~100-200m high off the ground, toward my house as I was watching from my window. My phone was too far away for me to have gone and get it, got the camera out, and then get a decent video, so instead I kept my eyes locked on to observe as much as I could. It seemed to just be going straight really slowly, until the point when it was almost out of view over my house (I was practically leaning as far out my window at this point as I could) and it took off straight upward as fast as you imagine the Millennium Falcon jumping to light speed. That one event really nailed it in my head that UFOs are not only real, but they utilise a physics that mainstream science says doesn't exist.  I've done plenty of research into the physics of UFOs and came across a few videos that I know are great:  [Stan Deyo - Lecture on anti-gravity technology](https://youtu.be/CsagEYfxPgs)  [Zero Point - Classified Anti-Gravity Craft. Documentary by James Allen](https://youtu.be/NBdS8jiTM6E)  And also I recommend the documentary ["Unacknowledged"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6400614/) which is available on Netflix or Amazon Prime.  Also, you ever heard of how Hollywood drip-feeds information? I can't remember where exactly i heard of it, but I had heard a theory a while ago about how some aliens pilot their craft through meditation and visualising where they wish to go. Well I saw Marvel's "Black Panther" the other day, and in one part the Wakandans are piloting their advanced craft exactly like that. I saw it and thought, "well... that's drip feeding if anything!" but I just can't remember where I originally saw it. Oh well. Thought I might as well share that anyway, since it's relevant.  Anyway, alongside these I want to include a series of videos from an alien abductee who tells not only of alien bases on earth, but the UFO tech, and pre-birth memories of conscious existence before incarnation. He was able to remember these suppressed memories with thanks to hypnosis regression sessions with Budd Hopkins.  Video 1: [50 minute talk of his experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU7uZ4a7aGs).  Video 2: [20 minute Q&A session](https://youtu.be/OPpjQCc79HQ).  Video 3: [20 minute talk about hypnosis sessions](https://youtu.be/2iHloKMY8lU).  ~~  Geez. That took a while to write... Sorry if it got a little lazy there at the end with my depth, but I started writing this about 7 hours ago and time just flew by. Thank you if you actually read all this, and I hope you save some of the link for later watching/reading!

I love this comment,  thank you!

Ooh thanks for that study link! I haven't seen it before, but I just read the abstract and it sounds proper interesting! I've saved it now for later reading. 

Thanks a fair point. If you read some of the papers he's published, he converts the units in accordance with the respective equations. I believe it's mostly presentation at the end, as having everything in the same units makes it easy for someone unfamiliar with quantum physics to understand. 

yea, totally agree.  the god equation is when it all started coming together.  funny how different our paths were though.  i somehow ended up on this website:http://armageddonconspiracy.co.uk/LOTS of crazy shit on there.  it actually starts off with flat earth o_O  but i dunno if it's supposed to be a metaphor or what.  from there, it's pretty much a conspiracy buffet, and also a extremely intriguing (and jarring) introduction to conspiracies in general--yeup, that was me.  it's almost a little creepy, because there's a very strong feeling of nonchalant conviction in his/their tone, like they have no doubt of the ability to and certainty of completing their objective.  there were still some questions or issues that i thought were left unaddressed though, which i thought was a little suspicious.  their idea of a true meritocracy sounds really good at first...but also sounds like another gateway to some totalitarian dystopia, except on the opposite end of the spectrum from communism.  like, the 100% inheritance tax is good in theory if you want extreme equality of opportunity.  but i feel like that's another idealistic proposal with huge potential for abuse, e.g. not worth it in practical terms.  plus, it might result in removing a major natural drive for success--to gather wealth to ensure the future of your offspring.  i dunno, just didn't get the best vibes from some of that stuff.anyway, going through the metaphysical concepts was a trip.  i also pursued the ontological mathematics idea for a while too...i definitely remember my mind being blown repeatedly.  dude...hold on lemme pull something i did that was inspired by this whole line of thinking.  actually, i'll leave it at the bottomand yea, i also get the feeling that this is NOT the product of a single mind, and a most likely a longtime in the making.  if i had to guess, i'd say it was a single voice that was responsible for the narration, but the content was probably discussed/selected by a group including hockney.  ok, so i didn't discover any of these--i just pulled the numbers and actually did the calculations, because i had to see for myself.  i'll start with the pyramids...**base perimeter of great pyramid = 3,023.16 feet****original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feet****base perimeter of great pyramid √∑ original height of great pyramid** = 3,023.16 feet √∑ 481.3949 feet = 6.2800000586.280000058 √∑ 2 = **3.140000029** that's prettty close to pi, close enough that i'd say it's probably not a coincidence.  but so what right?  well, mainstream consensus is that Ancient Egyptians thought pi was about 3.16, and that it wasn't until Archimedes that pi was recognized to be around 3.14.  so...questionable.ok, it gets weirder.  i'm gonna assume you're familiar with the significance of the number 432 yea?  so it turns out, the major, externally-visible dimensions of the pyramid, correlate to the dimensions of the earth at a scale of **432,000:1**.  crazy, considering that they had no idea of or way to confirm the dimensions of the planet (so we're taught).  **original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feet****481.3949 feet x 432,000** = 207,962,596.8 feet = **3,938.685 miles****3,938.685 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 11 miles, or an error of about 0.2%)****base perimeter of great pyramid = 3,023.16 feet****3,023.16 feet x 432,000 = 1,306,005,120 feet = 24,734.94 miles****24,734.94 miles = equatorial circumference of earth ( minus about 70 miles, or an error of about 0.6%)**(note: the accurate calculation of the dimensions of the earth are typically credited to Eratosthenes around 300-200 B.C.; go figure...)  but ok, so school and mainstream history are shit.  i can accept that.  this was my WTF moment.but some setup first...it's a very strange coincidence--one of many that include the moon--that the sun is 400x larger than the moon, and ALSO happens to be 400x further away from earth than the moon is, which is why we have total solar eclipses and total lunar eclipses.  meh.  here's another fun fact:**approximate speed of light = 186,000 miles per second****432 x 432 = 186,624 (an error of about 0.3%)**cool, but maybe just coincidence still right?## approximate diameter of the sun = 864,000 miles## 432 x 2 = 864## approximate diameter of moon = 2,160 miles## 432 √∑ 2 = 216when i saw that, i think i literally shivered and had thoughts of being in the matrix flashing through my head.  i dunno, that freaked the shit out of me personally, for at least 5 minutes.  i dunno...for the original, i had gone through a ton of other information all highlighting the cosmic holiness of the number 432, so maybe it got in my head by the time i made that last calculation XP  anyway, there's actually a ton of stuff like this.  i think this is the closest i'll get to experiencing some manifestation of ontological mathematics.  which is totally fine with me, because i was imagining like 6 foot tall, solid-colored, single-digit integers with eyes, arms and legs, and they weren't nice.

I've always felt like we're just taking things we can see and translating those things into numbers and equations, and that the numbers and equation don't really have any meaning beyond a system we created that allows us to predict the action/reaction of other things in our universe.   The equations are just representation of actions we observe, they don't *explain* anything.  It's like reverse engineering a video game, but not understanding anything about the system it runs on and how the system came to be (or who built the system).It's not like "oh the earth spins around the sun because of this underlying equation here"....no, it spins around the sun because it spins around the sun, you just translated that into a system of numbers to describe the same thing.  I feel like it gives us a superficial feeling of "understanding" the universe when really we dont know anything about what all of this is and why it's here.  It barely addresses the "how" beyond translating into numbers. Knowing the universe is a state of mind or being.  Science is drawing us farther and farther away from that via an inflated sense of understanding.   Knowing is a spiritual state.  

Wow you're good! Another intriguing idea is that exploiting the creative powers of everyday thought, starting in individuals, and subsequently ramping way up to populations is such a dastardly mastermind grand scheme...

 

> Karma means something is owedWhere are you getting this information from?

Thinking is the precursor of action. "Karma" means action.

Read The Mind Illuminated. That'll guide you. 

ruin ones day? I get what you mean... we spend our days chasing our tails around as per their design so we don't have time for spiritual development. 

Mediation and tantric yoga would be a good place to start. 

I don't think he came up with imaginary numbers. I think most of the work there was Euler, a contemporary (and then later Gauss).He took them seriously tho, wrestled with them philosophically and tried to integrate them properly in his conceptual model (whereas they were mostly lol'd at and shunned by others - imaginary as a label was meant to be derogatory.) On that infinite / complex front, I think you'll get a kick out of this...https://slehar.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/clifford-algebra-a-visual-introduction/If the math puts you off, skip down to "the inverse function". That made a whole lot of shit slot together for me in terms of infinity...

If this was condensed into a news article and ran in the New York Times the world would be a better place.

Thank you so much for reading! 

I‚Äôll check him out more, I guess I‚Äôm kinda unqualified to make this statement since I‚Äôve never read his work. But there are a lot of junk physics theories that work on bad math out there that you have to watch out for. And sadly it is virtually impossible for someone not versed in the math to be able to discern between what is legit and what isn‚Äôt. Edit: not sure what your math skills are, just talking in general

you should definitely read the mathematical universe by max tegmark. heres an interesting, also relevent talk from the same author. most interesting to note, he postulates these equations are concious.https://youtu.be/GzCvlFRISIM

Haha, You're awesome dude. I love this shit and you're always welcome to hit me up about it directly. I went to see Chichen Itza which kinda blew me away. The acoustic properties are ridiculous. That made me start taking a really close look at that sorta ancient architecture.Here's a mixed bag of shit I've come across in the last coupla years which I know you'll really vibe.https://interferencetheory.com/files/Interference.pdf - a grand musical theory of everything. which is to say waves rule errything around me. guy goes into a lot of interesting stuff to do with harmony, number, music, waves, history, everything. He spends a bunch of time analysing Rosslyn Chapel which is very very revealing from a practical and a historical perspective. When I came across that I'd already been following this guy for a while...http://www.goudryan.com/the-rbpr/the-pyramid-proportions/the-mathematics-of-the-giza-site-plan/Based on measurements he took from a ~3000BCish site in Scotland, he deduced a new value for Pi in terms of the square root of two which he called 'Qute'. It's spitting distance from the supposed rational pi of Giza (22/7) and really hammered home that ratio is how a lot of this shit works and the square root of two is mad important. After spending a crapload of time looking at this, I can confirm it's legit and indeed some of the lessons to be found in Giza are to do with this. Makes Giza look like a legit place of learning to have all this shit encoded so obviously in it. And it is pretty obvious when you start using it and whole numbers start popping out everywhere. Khafre the middle pyramid has a side-length of half the square root of 2 (707) which is a big clue. If you recall from the God Equation / Unit Circle that's also the point where the complex + real domains balance out....The layout of the whole site jives around sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), so whatever lesson is there is mathematical first and foremost. People are like, yeah but it's in feet.. but fail to realise that feet (and also the meter) were key'd to dimensions of the earth. How they got to that point, who knows, but it's pretty undisputable.(Arguably the foot spoken of is Gods foot.)On that front, for a really solid treatment on ancient metrology check out Taking Measure by Scott Onstott. You'll also really like his series on youtube 'secrets in plain sight' and his lil coffee table book Quantification which talks a lot about the numbers you mention (sometimes known as precession numbers but i think they are all 3-smooth numbers personally - also known as the harmonic numbers) Actually I'd probably start with those last two and work back from there. He looks pretty hard at the sort of mind-blowing "coincidences" you mention. 

Ugh, I hate these type of things. Take some values do some arbitrary arithmetic to it, get pi or phi or whatever, therefore consciousness, energy, we are all connected man. It makes no sense.All these things are most probably cooked up by some crank to peddle their book or course or cult, and are repeated ad nauseam by people on the internet. 

thats what im sayin dood loledit: i didnt incorporate the spiritual part so in fact i mispoke. we can know the whole but youre right thats a spiritual state.

Ok.  I don‚Äôt want to jus argue with you to ‚Äúwin‚Äù on this point, so please don‚Äôt take this response that way.  I don‚Äôt know how much you are into philosophy, but the ancient Greeks long ago proved that objective reality is a *faith* not a fact.  I certainly *may* exist but you or I are utterly incapable of proving it.I don‚Äôt bring this up to tell you that you are wrong or to convince you to believe me, rather because it is a worthwhile thought to contemplate.  *How can you tell that there is an external reality?*This is the philosophical thought exercise question that all the related ‚Äúbrain in a vat‚Äù theories stem from, here people usually express it as ‚Äúliving in a simulation.‚Äù  Can you actually prove to yourself that the world is real and you are not the only person here  and that everyone else is not just an ‚Äúnpc‚Äù (think like The Matrix style brain jack except you are the only one that is not an AI). Or the more simplistic version that most kids contemplate as their first native philosophical thought about reality (which I think having *this* or a similar thought is the sign that a child has fully become conscious):  ‚ÄúHow do I know that what I see as red doesn‚Äôt look yellow to someone else?  The only way we learn colors is by pointing to one and saying it‚Äôs name.‚Äù Curious as to your thoughts.

Books on Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism. The basic notion of karma is that if you do a bad action that you must atone for that action at some point in time. You build up and pay off karma. It's even referred to in those texts as 'karmic debt'. 

Thank you, I'll try and get my hands on that.

Exactly what I'm trying to say. Unless we forfeit certain things in our daily lives, maintaining spiritual activities is pretty hard to do. That's the design.

sweet, i can tell this is going to be fun a article!  totally dig his psycho-mathematical hypothesis--personally resonates with me very strongly.  also makes me wonder if we ended up with a system of math that describes imaginary numbers in this way because of some limitation in our thinking/perception, or if we developed a representation of mathematics that was flawed and its limitations manifest as weirdness like imaginary numbers which most people don't naturally/easily understand (me included).  but yea, i'm gonna try to struggle through the whole thing--only about 1/10 in so far XP

That would be beautiful to see. If only it were so easy to condense, but if anyone can do that then I'd emplore them to do so! It's still missing some links into alternative history, astrology, psychology, and aliens that I'd have liked to put in there, and I'd have liked to have gone into more detail with pretty much all the topics as well (but mostly the ufos part), but that was the first time I'd ever gone and put so much of it all out in one post, and since I did it in one sitting it's no surprise I missed out plenty. It's effectively a theory of everything. But hey, since it's now there at least I have somewhere to start! I plan to one day put all this in a book so getting something solid actually written down is gonna help.

All of these comments are amazing, they line up so closely with my own path and understandings. I think these would make a great holofractal superthread, even. 

Yeah that's a totally relevant point. In this field there's a lot of people who make all sorts of claims but can't back it up with anything solid. It's why I suggest reading the papers that explain the theory with the maths to go along with it. And even for those who aren't great at maths, the text explains what the maths is showing.  I was lucky that in the last few years of my schooling we covered quantum mechanics and particle physics pretty thoroughly, and it ended up being one of my favorite subjects so I continued studying it in my spare time since I left school. So I've got a pretty decent grasp on it. I'm definitely no expert, but I'm relatively confident of my understating, especially when the working is presented well. 

Oo, good shout.

haha damn sounds trippy, thanks!

Oh and I guy I started following recently has been chasing down that thread pretty hard too. Check out Danny Wilten on youtube. He does the Giza thing a ridiculous amount of justice. You'll be hearing a lot more of that name I reckon. He's what you'd get if Graham Hancock had a baby with a CIA analyst. 

eh...the calculations with the pyramid aren't all that arbitrary.  they use the two major visible dimensions of the pyramid with a single arithmetic operation.  it's not complicated...and you can call it a coincidence.  but i don't think most people would think that calculations that result in under 1% error can be automatically dismissed, especially in the context of the monumental efforts involved in building the great pyramid.  i mean seriously, try making ANYTHING that can correlate that closely to...pretty much anything else??  and we only have 4 simple operations for basic mathematics,  assuming they wanted to build a structure that would retain its form for a long time, i really don't see many other ways they could have done it better.  also, pi and phi are pretty fucking important and connected to **literally almost everything in the universe**.  i mean, if you don't care about or appreciate math or science at all, then sure, it's probably all just gibberish to you.  you might want to consider actually reading the descriptions of how the calculations are derived before judging them.  i didn't mindlessly copy/paste this information (well i did for reddit, but it was from my own article), i actually looked up the measurements and did the calculations to make sure it made sense--that was the whole point!

 

 

Can I also make a hand-wave to his Theodicy. It's where he gathers his ideas that confront and engage Christian theology straight on. It's also his work that explains his answer to the Problem of Evil: where the phrase "best of all possible worlds" comes from. Quite different from Augustine, and much more Matrix-like.As I understand it (anyone more knowledgeable jump in), he assumes the *potential* of infinite, different overlapping, even incompatible universes "created" or "thought" by an all-powerful God. This concept seems a lot like modern multiverse, but he held there was still only one "real" universe (possibly to stay out of trouble?).So with all those infinity of universes, he decides that IF God is Good, THEN we would inhabit the best possible version of all the possible universes - as shabby as it often appears to us. God only knows...edit

I agree, I think the key is relating all these topics to how it affects the average individual on a regular daily basis. That‚Äôs all the modern consumer cares about sadly and a book is a good way into doing exactly that so I wish you well!

wow, never heard of him, but i really like graham hancock (dunno if he's still around).  and i gotta look into this qute thing.  sqrt(2)'s always seem mathematically prominent to me.  sqrt(3) not so much...so that should be interesting.  o, and i've definitely seen secrets in plain sight, such a fun series.  by "his", are you referring to the narrator?  i always assumed it was just a random noname dude lol.  ahh just looked up precession number--didn't know that's what it was called.  thought you meant pi, e and phi...which are each an entire rabbithole.  i still need to go back to the god equation to remember how e fits into it all.wow you've gone through a LOT of this material O__O didn't know anyone else was into this.  but yea, i gotta get into at least some of this stuff right now, or you'll never get a reply XP

They are arbitrary. In your first example, why take the perimeter? Why not base? Why divide by 2? It is completely arbitrary.Second one: Alright 432 is special but 432000 is not 432, scaling to it makes no sense. The rest of the calculation is just a restatement of point 1. Third one is even more egregious. The errors in the previous cases can be attributed to factthat they involve human constructions  but in this case the parameters that you take are natural. Are you saying whatever caused this correlation reached at 98% and said "eh close enough".432*432 only becomes close to the speed of light if we use FPS system, so it is a coincidence.In taking the diameter of the sun you round *down* to the nearest thousand, but in taking the diameter of the moon you round *up* to the nearest ten. See, arbitrary.I do have an appreciation for Math and Science, which is why I can call bullshit on stuff like this.  

Thanks for the link, I have not read his work before and will look at it.  I still hope you take into account my reply to your other comment, your dismissal of ideas due to race is troubling.  And I don‚Äôt know where your statement:> There are others out there and I ask you find them. Philosophy is not just a white man's topic. Everyone from all walks of life can think and paint in abstract. Even children as young as 5 provide eye-opening insights. Seems to be assuming things that I never implied.  Maybe it is a misunderstanding of my reference. I specifically used Ancient Greeks as an example because they are the oldest philosophers that I know for a fact produced arguments that reality is impossible to prove.  My intent was to show that it is an *old* idea, not to confer superiority to one culture over others.   I hope that clarifies things and that you find a way to let go of whatever anger is troubling you.

I don‚Äôt really know how you think their race or sex or even perceptions of other societies figures into the validity of their theories which stand up to logical analysis.  Do those pointless trivia affect the validity of the Pythagorean theorem!?  These things can be evaluated mathematically.My belief isn‚Äôt given by other people, I read their ideas and choose whether I agree with them or even simply entertain their conclusions.  That is critical thinking.  My own beliefs are built upon learning from others.  There are also other cultures which have produced profound thought, even thoughts which I appreciate the value of if I don‚Äôt believe or agree with it.  Never has the race or sex or culture of the people been a factor of determining the value of it, though knowing this can help one understand the basis of their thought.It is honestly disturbing that you bring this up when it has no precedent in the discussion.  Even more disturbing that you are comfortable calling a culture ‚Äúlesser‚Äù.  It sounds like you are *extremely* hung up on ‚Äúpreconceived notions‚Äù from your response.  Accepting that reality is subject to perception is actually a step towards balance and a rather important notion of one wishes to find value from thought across many cultures. To claim that there is an objective reality is the basis for claiming there is a right and wrong way to think, and it is that very notion upon which prejudices are built.  That you arbitrarily label one group or another lesser is evidence of prejudice.  I hope you can release that and wish you good luck.

yea, i remember that one for sure.  i remember the math-y version a little better i think (err...i *think* this is from leibniz and not mike hockney, but i could be mixing them together...) it was something along the lines of there being one mathematical system that's perfect, which is the one that comprises our universe.  any other (imperfect) system would eventually destroy itself due to inconsistencies or other self-contradictory errors.  so i'm not sure that it completely precludes other universes existing simultaneously.  but then i don't know enough about his conception of time either, so that's not a surprise.  i'm listening to mike hockney's stuff again, which is heavily influenced (that's an understatement, leibniz is basically german jesus to him) by leibniz, so actually, there's a good chance the math version isn't from liebniz?but yea, listening to some of the concepts again, reminds me of how freakishly modern a lot of liebniz's ideas are.  i almost feel like he was able to achieve this through raw intellect, like brute forcing logic, savant-style.  it's like he was able to see past the patterns/dynamics between scientific development and philosophy, which allowed him to leap over centuries intellectually,  and actually get to the core philosophical issues that modern sciences is still dancing around.  i still think his monadology stuff is one of the most ambitious attempts at a TOE.  i still think there's space for simulation theory within his ideas, but maybe less developed in his time?  i mean it just wans't as in-your-face obviosu without computers and VR.  intuitively, i feel like these three concepts complement each other in describing the universe--holographic principles, fractals, simulations.  and i'm *almost positive* that these concepts are somehow subtly/not-so-subtly being pushed on us, because i've seen people randomly mentioning the same intuition online.  totally can't see why though...o_O'this stuff makes me feel so nostalgic.  this is where my whole "wtf is the illuminati" question started, and when i actually started considering the possibility that automatically dismissing conspiracies could be really really stupidi.  it's so crazy how a single thread of thought from a random session of browsing can lead to an absolutely exhaustive overhaul of your worldview.

Hancock's still around but I think he got sidetracked from his real research by his brand. The importance of the qute is pretty next level. There's a lotta dudes like that guy who've quietly torn things apart and are just waiting for the rest of the world to catch up.I think the true value of pi is one of the keys that allows you to unlock a lot of the ontological stuff in real terms. 'His' == narrator == Scott Onstott, yeah.https://affinemess.quora.com/What-is-math-pi-math-and-while-were-at-it-whats-math-e-math?That should help you slot e into the picture. Read interference theory for a solid treatment of phi. If you're a spreadsheet or a python sort of guy, I can probably throw some interesting snippets your way. 

1) again, there are only so many measurements visible from the exterior.  perimeter, height, diagonal, slant height and....?  ok...you can see there's not much else to work with.  and fine, like i said, maybe that's a coincidence, though given the abundance of other coded numbers found in the great pyramid, i really doubt it.  what i presented are just some that i was personally interested in.  2) are you serious???  if you wanted to use 432 in some way, that's the simplest way.  unless you would want to make a pyramid that's 1000 times bigger!  just wow...3 [this is actually still the same example...])  dude what are you even saying--do you even know?  this one is by far the most obvious, which is why you just start spouting some laughable word salad in your attempt to debunk it.  first of all, what does it matter if the parameters are natural??  it's the fucking radius and circumference of the planet LOL.  and both of those are proportional to the perimeter and height of the pyramid AT THE SAME RATIO.  and the error is under 1%, *as i clearly stated*.  of course you can claim it's still a coincidence, just nobody would agree with you.4) i'd agree with that, except that feet were used in all my previous examples as well.  and only?  you realize we didn't even get close to an accurate estimate of the speed of light until thousands of years later right?  and even more importantly, **the speed of light is actually coded into the pyramid in other ways, including one that matches it in the metric system, down to several decimal places**.  so...probably not a coincidence.5)  hmm...yea, see, because like i said, the sun is 400 times bigger than the moon 0__0  just factthat one number can relate in this way so closely to the two largest objects in the sky, using only 2 numbers, 2 operations, and scaling by 10s is amazing.  plus the example regarding the sizes is also incredibly stunning.  **factthat you make no mention of this makes it pretty obvious that you don't give a shit**, you're just trying to cover up factthat you made a stupid judgement--and you're failing pretty hard.i think it's at least clear you don't really have an appreciation for math (or when scaling is necessary, or how simple it is to add zeros while still retaining much of the same content, or the visible dimensions of a pyramid, etc.), though i suspect science as well.  or maybe you just don't have an appreciation for the english language, and don't understand what "arbitrary" means.  it's also likely that you just dismissed my reply (which wasn't even addressed to you) without really reading it the first time.  then when i called you out on it, you tried to pull some shit out your ass, but it turned out weak and forced, so now you look ridiculous, especially with your reasoning in #2,3,5.  sure, you can call bullshit on anything you want, but it doesn't mean much, especially in this case.

"scaling to it makes no sense"Neg. Harmonics.Everything is a wave brah.

 

The problem with simulation is this: if its true then there's absolutely nothing that would, could, or really needs to change.That is, in straight simulation, where we are someone's game pieces, very possibly as virtual as a million charge particles in tiny energy apartment blocks, there still is only one way to "break through" or "get free" or "realize who we are" that *are not the already existing ways to do those things*!

Oh and I can recommend taking a look at vedic mathematics.What is now mostly remembered as a system of mental shortcuts are actually the faint echos of a very complete understanding of that most special of number bases (modulo 9 / base 10). Using that you can perform operations on stupidly large numbers as strings of individual digits / characters. Think about that...(I'd recommend the physics side of the vedic stuff too. both Tesla and Einstein credited the Vedic Sutras as a source of great inspiraton. They also have one of the most chill 'creation' stories I've read. It's like a cosmic wink and a shrughttp://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10129.htm ) 

1) You did not rebut my point at all. Like you said there are multiple measurements visible from the exterior. perimeter, height, base width and  slant height. My point is that there are so many combinations measurements available so why this particular combination is selected? The division by two after taking their ratio is also completely arbitrary and is just there to force pi.2) The ratio between radius of earth and height of great pyramid is much closer to 434000 than 432000, circumference of earth and base perimeter of great pyramid is around 435000 not 432000.>3,023.16 feet x 432,000 = 1,306,005,120 feet = 24,734.94 milesAlso Your math is off by a whole order of magnitude, so you clearly have not checked it. 3) Let me explain. Let, height of great pyramid be (h) , base perimeter of great pyramid be p, radius of earth be r, circumference of earth be c.From your first statement p/h  ‚âà 2*pi, by definition the ratio between the circumference of any circle and its radius  2*pi. So we can take any circular spherical or cylindrical object and we can say that the ratio of its circumference is the same as p/h. We can do this with any object, all we have to do is pick a magic number as a scaling factor and look for any object which has a similar size as the scaled down or up dimension. For example a my dick is approximately cylindrical and has a radius of 1.3 inches the circumference of its cross section is ‚âà 8.168 inches.We all know 432 is special so 4320 is also special.**Height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feet****481.3949 feet √∑ 4320 = 0.111434005 ft = 1.33720806 inches.****1.33720806 inches = Radius of my dick (with an error of 2%)****Base perimeter of great pyramid = 3,023.16 feet****3,023.16 feet √∑ 4320 = 0.699805556 ft = 8.397666672 inches.****8.397666672 inches = the circumference of my dick (with an error of 2%)**SpooooookyEither ancient Egyptians scaled the pyramids with respect to my dick (in a ratio of 1:4320) or this type of argument is bullshit. You pick.4) Where is it stated in the pyramid that the speed of light is 432 squared in miles per second? Miles and seconds were units invented 1000s years after the Ancient Egyptians.> you realize we didn't even get close to an accurate estimate of the speed of light until thousands of years later right?If it is not explicitly written down or used in some sort of measurement that the speed of light is so and so then we cannot assume that they knew it.All this arithmetic voodoo is just working backwards from what we already know. > the speed of light is actually coded into the pyramid in other ways, including one that matches it in the metric system, down to several decimal placesAgain metric system is 1000s of years younger than the pyramids. So you are saying that not only did the Egyptians know the speed of light but they also knew what units we would use in the future.Which is more plausible Ancient Egyptians had advanced scientific knowledge and ability to *predict the future* or all these "codes" that you seem to find in the pyramids are a product of your own confirmation bias?? 5) factthat the sun is 400 times bigger than the moon and is 400 times as far is amazing but it is still a coincidence. > two largest objects in the sky, using only 2 numbers, 2 operations, and scaling by 10s is amazingBut it is not just two operations, you arbitrarily round up the moon's size and round down the sun's size. Anything can seem related if you apply arbitrary set of rules.Personal attacks are unnecessary and exposes your own childishness.Edit: Formatting

Wow.  You are so far into your belief that you will attempt to fit any information into it.  I was never angry or offended, simply surprised at your heavy prejudice.  Goodbye.

hmm i guess i don't mean it exactly in that way--i still believe there is free will.  i'm just not sure about everything else.  it could be a bias though.  not sure why i expect "natural" things to be analog in nature rather than digital.  

1)  >>like i said, maybe that's a coincidence, though given the abundance of other coded numbers found in the great pyramid, i really doubt it. what i presented are just some that i was personally interested in.2) off by a digit.  but yes, "a whole order of magnitude" sounds much fancier.  -__-  anyway, like i said before, and which you apparently still don't understand, you can still convey useful content while staying mathematically consistent by using zeros, especially since they can represent a placeholder, as it does in our number system.  here's another example:  00you're00a00fucking00retard00.  but i'm sure you'll just chalk that up to coincidence.3) mm yea...difference is, no one cares about your dick (which you've described as comically large, most likely overcompensating for its equally comical tininess in actuality), and you arbitrarily picked those numbers.  also, your % errors are more than "an order of magnitude" greater than between the earth and pyramid.  finally **the earth is not a perfect sphere**.  it's especially funny how stupid you are when trying to seem intelligent XD4)  ok, so you're criticizing me for arbitrarily making things fit, yet **you're completely ignoring well-known facts to fit your arguments**.  the "invention" of seconds by the ancient babylonians preceded the egyptians.  and the metric system is based off the measurements of the earth.  so maybe check your own confirmation bias.  5)  uhh what were you trying to do here?  the first sentence is quoted but you don't say anything about it (probably because there's not much to say).  anyway, if you want to "arbitrarily" ignore the last part of the sentence, that's on you.  i'm okay with personal attacks when dealing with a biased and retarded neckbeard who's more concerned with being right (yet still failing) than acknowledging reality (especially when wrong, instead of doubling down on idiocy).  if that makes me child, then just know you're [much] dumber than a child ;D

 

Because logic. It's man-made. Nature is analog, I can assure you to the limits you want to study it.

1) > like i said, maybe that's a coincidence, though given the abundance of other coded numbers found in the great pyramid, i really doubt it. what i presented are just some that i was personally interested in.My point is that all these "coded" messages you speak of are not actually put in by the Egyptians but "discovered" after factby cranks with books to sell. Given a set of numbers it is extremely easy to connect them with pi or phi or any so called cosmic numbers with simple arithmetic operations.2) Yeah, off by a digit. What it shows is that you don't know what you are talking about, and just copy pasted this whole wall of text from some crank website without verifying it yourself. Zero is not just a placeholder. Are you telling me that 10 and 100 are the same? Maybe I should tell this to my Machine Design professor, material selection just got a whole lot easier.3) Thank you again for completely missing the point. What I was trying to demonstrate is that you can use your line of reasoning to connect anything to anything. You can connect pyramids to coke cans, oil drums, soccer balls etc just the way I connected pyramids to my dick. The errors that I get are the same as that stated in your example, around 2 %.4) >ok, so you're criticizing me for arbitrarily making things fit, yet you're completely ignoring well-known facts to fit your argumentsSo, you admit you make things fit arbitrarily. Also, What facts have I ignored? I pretty much rebutted everything in your comment point by point.The rest of your comment needs a big [Citation needed]. It wasn't untill the 16th century that clocks that can reliably keep track of seconds were developed. 5) You are the one that is ignoring evidence. You still haven't responded to why you round the moon's size up and the sun's size down.I have wasted enough time on you. It is clear that you wont back up any of your claims against criticism with actual arguments and instead resort to personal attacks. I have nothing more to say to you. 

If anything, it is frustration that you refuse to *listen* to what I am stating clearly and continue to argue points that are not related at all to anything I wrote;  you are arguing with yourself.I never placed any special consideration on the reference to Greek philosophers or the validity of their claims.  I only said that they were old, and had made the point I was making a long time ago.  *All that is meant to prove is that people have been thinking this for millennia, and that the idea was not my own.*. Whether they were ‚Äúthe first‚Äù to think of any particular idea or not isn‚Äôt relevant, just that I know for a fact that they did indeed propose that idea, but I do not know for certain if another culture did before them, most likely many others did before them, but that constitutes a *guess* on my part.I get that apparently you are into the writings of other cultures and want to share them, that is awesome!  However, doing so confrontationally by insulting certain ones and implying racial bias towards people for mentioning the most widely known ancient philosophers is not a productive way to do so.  Look at this discussion!  You have continuously accused me of some phantom bias and we ended up in *this* pointless discussion when you could have used all those words to share some of the more interesting parts of the philosophers you want to share.  Instead you continuously tried to assign your own perception of the world to what I have said (ironically proving my original point of how much our perception of reality influences what we take to be *real*). I can clearly see and understand that you are frustrated by the primacy Greek philosophy holds in western education.  But you should understand that this isn‚Äôt universal, a culture‚Äôs education gives primacy to the specific cultures upon which it is built.  In Asia, I imagine that Asian philosophy holds primacy in the general education, and in the Muslim world the focus is on Muslim philosophers and so on and so forth.  Obviously, a well-rounded education should include as many different views as possible, but I don‚Äôt know how you believe I am ‚Äúgatekeeping‚Äù simply by referencing one that suits the purpose of my argument both by directly addressing my point, and by being very familiar to most of my audience.  It would do no good to reference a scholar that almost no one is familiar with in the context of my statement.

wait, are you talking in the context of simulation theory?  e.g. the nature outside this simulation?  or that this isn't a simulation and reality here IS analog?  because a lot of our newer science seems to hint at a digital nature, like the planck length being the minimum distance or quantum entanglement allow instantaneous transmission of information.  there could be other explanations for sure, and maybe we're just not there yet.

 

right - not arguing with the surprising digital aspects we do find like the planck number, but consider the 99% of territory we can investigate and find systems that turn out non-binary, and apparently continuous, often fractal or otherwise infinitely dense. This is the fundamental problem with a Wolframesque Universe - made of bits all the way down. We made up bits, as far as I can tell. Nature has waves or something.

Are you aware that formal logic works on the principles of mathematics?A proof of the Pythagorean theorem operates the same way as a logical proof of a philosophical argument using Boolean statements.If you want to invalidate the premise that objective reality can not be proven, you will really need to know this.To my knowledge the ancient Greeks were the first to put that premise into rigorous formal logic and keep a written record of it.  As I said, this could be a lack of my familiarity with other groups *or* merely historic coincidence that their written record happened to survive whilst others were lost to time.At this point you aren‚Äôt really arguing with me, but with the historical record which I am merely citing.I am tired of arguing over arguments.  If you want to respond, why don‚Äôt you contribute some ideas from the people you hold in high esteem so that we can discuss them.  I am sure that would make a more productive discussion, their words are likely more interesting than mine.

i see. so maybe it's our perceptual limitations that cause us to interpret stuff in this way.  weird though, what's that say about us?? lol

 

So Wolfram (author of the mathematica franchise and the book "A New Kind of Science") suggests that because computing using binary Turing machines is so incredibly powerful, the universe itself must be a Turing Machine. Therefore he really pushes back against things like Godel's Uncertainty Principle, and Turing's Halting Problem.I actually like Wolfram's ideas, but not that one. I cannot believe the universe can be computed by what we have now. It has to be something more like the holofractal ideas. Or the fuzzy logic which is now being instrumentalized with quantum and DNA computing, where the answers come back shades of grey instead of black and white. But the problem is logic - it's famously binary due to the Excluded Middle. There's nothing in between true and false. (Which is why "truthy" and "falsy" are so funny to us - those make perfect sense to me - but I've drank the koolaid on this one.)

Kurt G√∂del would like a word with you. Absolute statements in mathematics are only absolute within their own paradigm. IE they have to be absolute, in order for the system thereof derived to be functional. Also, there is no logical proof that objective reality does not exist, because there can be no logical proof that anything does not exist. Russel's teapot.Do you not think that, if there was no objective reality, it could not appear as if it was? That is, the existence of apparent absolutes is not inherently a proof of an objective reality, since if this is a subjective reality, it may appear as objective. How can you tell?Of course, this is based on the works of a bunch of old white men, so feel free to disregard it if it's too much.

interesting...i'm gonna hafta look through more of this stuff.  at least half is completely new to me XP.  thanks!

Hope I'm not too late to the party! So a fascinating fact I learned the other day is that Charles Manson was actually sent to Boys Town as a youth. His stay there was short, but he was nonetheless sent there. My source for this is the recent Time Magazine publication on killer cults. Another interesting thing about him was all the celebrities he bumped shoulders with, including those in the occult. While on the subject of the occult, there is a film director from the same time period named Kenneth Anger who made a lot of occult videos and short movies, and who also participated in various occult groups throughout the years. He even had Jim Morrison and Anton Levay in his movies (as well as other famous hollywood stars of the time). He was also reported to have done graphic movies, as well as possible snuff films. The only reason I discovered him and his videos is because of a music video on YouTube called "Duality" , by Captain Murphy. It is a compilation of cult footage, as well as occult footage, all blended together for 35 minutes. I suggest watching it, as I would like to hear someone else's opinion on it considering it is a modern-day occult video. The occult is alive and well, and people are being a lot more blatantly open about it these days.

FBI Director for 20+ years Ted Gunderson speaking about the Franklin Coverup.https://youtu.be/ST1zqhCqHW4‚ÄúTed Gunderson joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in December 1951 under J. Edgar Hoover. He served in the Mobile, Knoxville, New York City, and Albuquerque offices. He held posts as an Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge in New Haven and Philadelphia. In 1973 he became the head of the Memphis FBI office and then the head of the Dallas FBI office in 1975. Ted Gunderson was appointed the head of the Los Angeles FBI in 1977.‚ÄùHe became a private investigator and was the start of the Franklin Coverup. He gave his life to fight what he thought was high level satanic occultism that had permeated society on a grand scale.

I discovered something very relevant to this the other day. Crowley was a Freemason, active in a great number of lodges. I don't know much about the Masons but I found this surprising. I found this lengthy, thorough, and well-sourced write-up of the connections on an official Freemason site. Worth a read.[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/crowley.html](http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/crowley.html)

In Alan Moore's *V for Vendetta*, the character V proclaims that *'Do as thou wilt'* will be the law.Alan Moore is supposedly a practitioner of magick himself.Given that a lot of people in this sub identify with or are supportive of the ideas behind 'Anonymous' I will be interested to see if any address this.

I personally don't like the Idolizing of Aleister Crowley.Fact: He died penniless and alone. "Although the actual dates of Crowley‚Äôs death are heavily disputed (either Dec 1st or Dec 5th) it is true that he died a heroin addict in 1947 in a boarding house in Hastings, South East England." [source](https://listverse.com/2012/09/22/10-facts-about-the-great-beast-aleister-crowley/)Fun Fact: when I first read the abovementioned Fact I read, He died penisless and alone.

Oh Jimmy Comet....He's either the King of being EdgeLord at 40 years old or exactly what we think he is.

 

[Here](https://youtu.be/1tZq-uwTS30) is a great higherside chat on satanic ritual abuse. 

The Catholic church is the head of the serpent as shown in plain sight for all to see yet they have their "eyes wide shut". the CIA is taking over the US government as Americans sit complacently. Tell me this is not dark times.

I really hope this isn't meant to equate Crowley with the Franklin cover-up.. Occultism does not automatically mean ritualistic murder and rape of children.

My 2 cents:  The Franklin coverup is a fascinating conspiracy that involves government and government paymaster malfeasance. Some day when powerful bad guys are dead some witnesses are going to talk and even more really horrible truths are going be revealed but the evidence trail  will have decayed to uselessness by that point and these truths may  never be proven.  Satanic cults are a real thing but they are insignificant in the systemic corruption that weighs us all down. For almost all practical purposes magic is a weapon of the weak; when the rich and powerful want to make things happen they don't waste their time with magic. Satanism is an edge case and there is a wide spectrum from the people who do Left Hand Path practices all the time to people who do so once in great while for a special project where they think it is the right tool for this job and it is not the right tool for almost all of the magic ends they usually pursue.  Most occultists are, to be honest, losers. They have shit jobs and occupy dumps and drive beater cars and their magic is a largely self-delusion that they aren't such a loser. Apropos to Crowley if you live in a big city you can go to an open OTO meeting and see this for yourself.  Aleister Crowley was like a lot of people who are very smart and read great books and know a lot of stuff and if they could have just paired up with a professional editor their books might be great instead of being barely readable. It is never a chore to read a great book. It is a chore to read Aleister Crowley. There is a small percentage of really great content hidden in that mess but it can be exhausting to pry it out of all the crap. The traditional explanation of it's concealed and revealed, or it has to be obfuscated to keep it away from the unworthy is bullshit. My favorite Crowley story is the one in Webb's book where he spent a week at Gurdjieff's commune and infuriated the other guru who expected everybody to be respectful and pitch in and do their fair share of the work. G. G. was a hospitable host as his upbringing required but the minute Crowley left the instruction was recorded the  moocher was never allowed back.  The only essential Crowley books are, in order, 777, Thoth, and Book IV. If you go through the hassle of reading these three books you will  have 99% of all quality Crowley. Here and there scattered through them is some really great stuff.  Organized in reverse order to A. C., Satanism, and Franklin posted above as the relevance of these three subjects to this sub is presented upside down. :)

Jason A's youtube channel recently did a short video on Satan, rock bands and Aleister Crowley.  Warning as Jason A's stuff has religious undertones (which I don't mind, but some may) but the information is solid.He discusses AC/DC, Led Zepplin, Hendrix, The Beetles and many many others who are not only quoted as saying they 'worship Satan' or that they automatically wrote songs that they claim they did not write - but also all these bands adoration for Aleister Crowley (some knowing him personally) and his philosophies.https://youtu.be/r1Ge-hBfRAYAlthough Jason A has religious context, his videos are some of the best being produced on YouTube today.  He never speaks himself, but only shows lectures, sermons, news broadcasts and articles to make you think and connect the dots yourself.  You come to your own conclusions from the multiple sources he presents.

I've always been confused with Aleister Crowley being the poster boy of Hermeticism. Isn't he the same Aleister Crowley who committed ritual abuse? The cult advocate? How could he be associated something as pure as spiritual alchemy?

Pizzagate, the topic with the majority of the votes every roundtable, is a honorable mention! The true conspiracy is always in the posts!

**Jack Parsons** and **L. Ron Hubbard** both basically worshipped Crowley, and together did many **Satanic Magickal Workings**https://scicrit.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/3937/

I do believe Winston Chruchill enlisted his services to counter possible ancient rites and magick utilized by the Nazis?

Is there a list of links for photos and video of modern day examples? (Ex. That weird CERN opening ritual, podesta with that goat head mask, etc?) Anyone have good photo/vid proofs?

No, not the Franklin cover up. That scares me and gave me nightmares and my relative was involved. Supposedly just associated with one of the main people but I have my fears based on personal knowledge. I never hear anyone talking about this so I was startled to see it here. It's horrible horrible horrible. 

 

I will be reading through this one. Don‚Äôt forget AC‚Äôs ties to Jack Parsons, and Parsons‚Äô relationship with L. Ron Hubbard.

Many Cults believe in melding beliefs, try to summon power, and try to use distorted interpretations to their advantage. My point - not just Satan. The Satanic Panic was a vert successful campaign. Many people have been terrified. Shit's recycled.

CBTS trying to take out dem satanic cult and we get banned. Conspiracy? Yes. 

''Black magic is not a myth. It is a totally unscientific and emotional form of magic, but it does get results ‚Äî of an extremely temporary nature. The recoil upon those who practice it is terrific. It is like looking for an escape of gas with a lighted candle. As far as the search goes, there is little fear of failure!To practice black magic you have to violate every principle of science, decency, and intelligence. You must be obsessed with an insane idea of the importance of the petty object of your wretched and selfish desires. I have been accused of being a "black magician." No more foolish statement was ever made about me. I despise the thing to such an extent that I can hardly believe in the existence of people so debased and idiotic as to practice it.''The few times Crowley did practice black magick (which is not a part of his magical system in the least), it did recoil terribly on him.

also remember Aleister Crowley's role in Rocketry and the Scientology movement.> After a brief involvement with Marxism in 1939, Parsons converted to Thelema, the English occultist Aleister Crowley's new religious movement. In 1941, alongside his first wife Helen Northrup, Parsons joined the Agape Lodge, the Californian branch of the Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). At Crowley's bidding, he replaced Wilfred Talbot Smith as its leader in 1942 and ran the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Avenue. Parsons was expelled from JPL and Aerojet in 1944 due to the Lodge's infamy and allegedly illicit activities, along with his hazardous workplace conduct.>In 1945 Parsons separated from Helen after having an affair with her sister Sara; when Sara left him for L. Ron Hubbard, he conducted the Babalon Working, a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon to Earth. He and Hubbard continued the procedure with Marjorie Cameron, whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and went through various jobs while acting as a consultant for the Israeli rocket program. Amid the climate of McCarthyism, he was accused of espionage and left unable to work in rocketry. In 1952, Parsons died at the age of 37 in a home laboratory explosion that attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident, but many associates suspected suicide or assassination.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Parsons_(rocket_engineer)

Kenneth Anger and Hollywood vogue occultism is a far cry from, say, Manley P Hall and his goals.  California has had stretched, dirivitive  occultism since the turn of the century with the "bohemians." Most of it is made up shit so they can collect mummies and wear cool robes.  You think I'm kidding.    

I also remember reading Manson was imprisoned in Vacaville when they were doing MKULTRA tests.

Watch Eye of the Devil, Sharon Tate was in that movie. It is REALLY creepy.

[More on Manson and Boys Town](http://cavdef.org/w/index.php?title=Project_MKUltra#Charles_Manson): the Los Angeles ranch where his "Family" stayed was adjacent to another ranch owned by an influential Omaha businessman who funded Boys Town.

Duality is a masterpiece if anyone ever fancies a listen, this background info on the whole thing is incredibly interesting. I am about to research Kenneth Anger now so I will report back with findings.

All that matters is getting the point across that moral relativism does not exist.You ( or the plural government you) don't get to commit violence. JustThe same anyone else.

The entire quote is "do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. LOVE is the law, LOVE under will..."This changes the meaning entirely. The will of man should be entirely supported by ‚ù§Ô∏è. This is only one interpretation I've heard and just thought I would share.

V also has "Vi Veri Vniversvm Vivvs Vici" in the "Shadow Gallery", which is a motto of Crowley's for the Magister Templi. However, the phrase was used in "Faust" also, which is from whom V says it originates.

I have trouble supporting Anon, and one reason is connected with your point - their activities promote chaos, just like the line "do as thou wilst."  Chaos is a powerful and easy tool for destruction.  It simply speeds up entropy by introducing randomness into a system, whereas bringing order requires much more energy and skill.Another problem I have with Anon is their sign-off, where they say "we are Legion, for we are many."  That is straight from the Bible, in Mark 5:9, where Jesus is confronting the demon within the madman at the tombs.  Jesus asks the demon its name, and it answers, "We are Legion, for we are many."Demonic forces are subtle, and can operate within groups completely undetected.  I think Anon is a group of usefull, unwitting tools being wielded by a master manipulator.

You're absolutely right. There should not be idolizing of Crowley. He himself said he hated having fan boys and girls. He wanted people to carve their own spiritual path.

> He died penniless and alone.    This is true, and he predicted in "Liber ABA" that this would be the case. He exerted all his effort and money into producing and distributing his works above all else, which I daresay is admirable, not worthy of contempt. Think of all the losers in history who died after only doing things anyone else could have, and then look at the unique and bizaare reputation of Crowley, his work, etc.    Also, fucking Listverse is not a good source. For anything. The first bullet is already wrong. According to Crowley's own bio in Liber ABA, he does list his first sexual *act* at 14 - with a *guy*. He lists his first sexual *act* with a *female* at 16, with a "theatre girl", not a maid. Number 7 is just insulting to anyone who understands the distinction between bisexuality and homosexuality. Number 6 is completely retarded - he used the *symbol* of the Holy Guardian Angel because, according to his own description in Liber ABA, he didn't think anyone was stupid enough to take it seriously. He also didn't consider Aiwass to be that symbol until late in his life. (The HGA is actually part of the self, according to Crowley, not a literal angel.) Number 5 is completely stupid - "Fact: it is *rumored*" Well then it's not a damn fact! 4 is correct, for the most part, save that it makes him sound like he died of heroin overdose. He didn't, he died of kidney failure that was bound to be his death since childhood, as he had poor kidneys from birth. 3 and 2 are correct, but number 1 is again completely stupid. It's a rumor based on idiocy and Crowley's reputation rather than any legitimate source.    However, /u/ToHeliopolisWithLove is correct, and he didn't want to be treated as another plaster saint. I do believe he had something legitimate to teach, however.

Edgar Allen Poe also died basically penniless and alone. 

Both outcomes are equally undesirable. 

This penniless and alone shit is a bulkshit trope trotted out whenever Crowley is mentioned. The man made it to end. He‚Äôs a failure because he squandered his wealth instead of saving it?  He had visitors up until the very end. I would venture to say the man most likely accomplished more before 30 than you ever will in your entire life. I could be wrong, maybe people will be discussing you on the internet and writing books about you 70 years from now. 

> He died penisless and alone.Ironically, he did sustain an injury to the perimeum when ice skating as a teenager, which pained him for the rest of his life. 

This!

This!

And if anyone was thinking this is isolated think again https://youtu.be/DFZRQcSMeeM 

Ive heard from multiple sources that saying ‚ÄúIve heard from multiple sources‚Äù will get you downvotes. Have one on me.

The mongols just took over Hungary and slaughtered 140,000.  Just some perspective, definitely interesting times, I just think dark might be a touch heavy. ;)

This. *Occultism* has gotten an incredibly bad rap. Sure, some things *branded* occult knowledge have some interesting layers, but oftentimes it had to be hidden by whatever elite rulers were at the top at the time.

However, dark occultism (I.e. Those who would purposefully hide the truth for nefarious purposes) does tend to tie into satanism/Crowleyism. I am not a Christian per se, but I am using satanism in reference to those who put their selves above all others and those who believe in moral relativism.

Exactly. Most equates to a modern day practice of mystery religions in general. Occultism is as broad a term as Religion. Let's not pretend modern, mainstream religions are somehow exempt from "ritualistic murder and rape of children".

On further review I found a passage in Webb's *The Occult Underground* which is appropriate for people curious about the subject of black magic in high places.  > Huysmans, in the words of one of his contemporaries, had a terrible tendency "to believe what he read," and his suggestibility was to lead to further ramifications. The novelist's friend Jules Bois, a journalist, who shared his interest in occult matters, possessed the same credulity. He was later to print documents given by Boullan to Huysmans containing the information that at every court of Europe magical evocations were practiced, and that Prussia crushed France at Sedan because of her superior evocatory powers.  p.158-9  Webb was a scholar and a skeptic. If you follow the footnotes in this book you may find the best documentation on the subject. That is the place where I would start.  *The Harmonious Circle* is the Webb book where you can find the dope on Crowley. Why Webb would exert all of this energy on topics which he dismissed as rubbish is a mystery, but I am glad that he did and it is a pity that he died so young.

> some knowing him personally)This Jason A sounds full of shit. None of those bands were old enough to know Crowley personally, unless you think a 7 year old John Lennon was chilling with Crowley on Aleister's deathbed. Read the biographies of these bands like Hammer of the Gods for Zeppelin and you'd know these recycled 1980s crazy christian claims are moronic.

I agree. Been following him for more than a year.One of the good ones left in youtube.There used to be many. 

The drummer of TOOL is really really into Crowley and the Occult. http://dannycarey.org/library/

Thanks dude. People need to here this.

He's definitely the poster boy for certain Hermetic orders, but really I think he is his own "poster boy", if anything.Crowley is one of the most well known but least understood individuals of the 20th century. His works are prolific and not exactly easy to approach and absorb. I would take any anecdotal accounts and/or personal interpretations of his work with a grain of salt.  Find the substantiated evidence of him being involved in "ritual abuse" (Do you mean ala MK-ULTRA?) and I'll consider it, it's just most stories I've read involving him and abuse are dubious at best.

Know that‚Äôs a conspiracy I need to hear.

Yeah give me that old time conspiracy!

>Since prehistoric times, we have generally acted like it is somehow our divine right to trash up their beautiful and immeasurably valuable planet. Since industrialization we've been systematically destroying the planet as if that were our civilization's primary purpose.What makes you think that this is an intrinsic human trait, and isn't something that is manufactured? 

Hang on, you said "christian's ideas should be based on the first god's opinions of the second, so they should be wrong." I'm not exactly following your logic here. Why should they be wrong? Just because they believe the first god's opinions? So what makes the second god's opinions right? factthat he's second? Sorry if I'm totally missing it, but that one whooshed right over my head.

Satan is also known as the author of confusion"The Great Deceiver"Seems to coincide 

Make a new sub? Cbtsstream was alllllright.

I have struggled to find the quote ever since I read it, but I recall someone close to Crowley stating that, in their opinion, Crowley was destroyed by the Magick itself. Are you familiar with the quote? I would love to have it available for discussions like this in future. 

Can you cite any specific examples of black magicians that have successfully performed magick, and also the implied recoils?

Crowley ate shit, called himself "the great beast 666", bragged about sodomizing his daughter, fucked goats, slit a goats throat during intercoarse with his partner, of which many killed themselves. I mean... jeez, u say "the few times crowley did practice black magick" - his whole life was about defaming God after his Dad died randomly as a child. He was going to be a preacher but got so enraged at his fathers untimely death that he took it upon himself to desecrate all that he could. Any decent person wouldn't JOKE with you about anything this guy does... 

Wow.

Incredible post btw

holy info, wow.

Thank-you for your service to our species

Do you know about the 43 star maps

As someone who knows little to nothing regarding these topics, I‚Äôm curious; are these links purporting to prove the existence of magic and the occult? Or the power of the occult? And is there anything definitive or provable to back any claims or stories?Quite the collection you have here regardless. 

From mere descriptions of L. Ron's behavior, Crowley identified that he was a con man, writing in a letter, "Suspect Ron playing confidence trick -- Jack Parsons weak fool -- obvious victim prowling swindlers." Hubbard had an ability to totally charm some people, but at the expense of being completely transparent to others.

This facet of Crowley is probably the best fit for /r/conspiracy. It is substantiated, has a lot of juicy and salacious details and involves a high-level individual wrapped up in a weird esoteric practice. Not to mention the twisty-turney line of connections that Hubbard and Parsons both had throughout government/technology and business at the time.Hubbard was a flim-flam man and Parsons may have been one of his earliest victims. 

A man who has the credentials to prove he was FBI and a creator in CoIntelPro, with documented history of other whistleblowers backing his credentials, like Gene Tatum who helped reveal the Oliver North scandal, you are trying to say that this massive conspiracy he showed all of his work for, is wrong because you don't support the results of the tunnels. Can you discredit all the info in his reports? Or just try to tarnish the name and thus the whole conspiracy by association?

Wait a second, but is your ISGP article supposed to discredit Ted Gunderson?   Seriously, have you actually listened to the man speak or read any of his writing? If you're casting shade on Gunderson, that article did little to nothing to cause me to doubt him. For anyone else reading this, just listen to Gunderson speak on some of these topics, read the ISGP article and other criticisms of him if you so choose, and come to an informed decision. I found him highly credible and definitely didn't get the impression he was in it for money or personal recognition, but what do I know.Edit: a couple words

what about Scientology? 

Awesome! Have additional readings or topics i can look up?

What do you mean with the goals of MPH? 

Time to go down that rabbithole!

Oh wow, evwn more interesting she was chosen to be murdered. 

Thank you for the additional read. I was blown away when i made the connection, I'm glad it actually goes a little deeper.

https://decider.com/2016/09/26/who-took-johnny-the-documentary-about-the-infamous-cold-case-is-now-on-netflix/ ; it looks like it was on netflix at one point.

Hm. K. Well, you can throw the word love in there, but it's still putting your own will above everything else. The very definition of selfishness. That is not good, or loving. Putting others above yourself and your own will, is.

It's a statement endorsing antinomianism. Do what you want according to your will.  

Plus the  Jesuit mask they use.

As did Jesus. Funny how people manipulate popular myths to their own ends.

Thank you for your in depth knowledge. I honestly just posted that source to make the joke, I didnt fact check.I agree with you, he did have something legitimate to teach. I truely enjoyed reading **some** of his work.

i thought that, too. penniless and alone is the way a fair amount of them go. 

indubitably

 

That has nothing to do with factthat he was a degenerate. All of that talent and intelligence used to harm people, even people from his own congregation, with baneful magick. I‚Äôm glad his life backfired on him. While we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs laud Hitler‚Äôs accomplishments too. Heck of a painter. 

I never said he was a failure. Or that he didnt accomplish anything. I said I don't like how people idolize him.I didn't want to shit on the guy but he liked to write about being shit on. So tell me more about how you love his work. Its not that good. And the parts that are good are not even his own novel ideas. Go get your pitchfork."Churn on me, Leah! Twist on your thighs! Smear diarrhoea Into my eyes! Splutter out shit From the bottomless pit." - Aleister imsoaccomplished Crowley3rd edit - I respect the man to some extent. I just wish people knew who someone like say, Dame Frances Yates is to accociate with hermetic work and occult rather then Crowely.

Such as Gonorrhea?King of edgelords is what this fool was IMO

He was a helluva mountaineer too. The man lived a life. 

What did that comment say?

140,000? We have 8,000,000,000 people living on Earth now. All it takes is 1 disaster... Could be a deadly flu, could be war/depopulation. Sure it may seem ok to some, but to most of us paying attention to the real world vs reality TV see that we are headed for dark times ahead and are doing so little to prepare.

indeed. not all of it is evil, not all of it has been corrupted. that being said, there are some that do practice very self serving rituals. there are those that spill blood, sometimes their own... sometimes not. there are sex rituals. there are coming of age rituals. there are fertility rituals. they are not mutually exclusive, nor are they all the same.there are some people that seek to gain favor from certain entities, (i believe they exist, i dont ask anyone else to, most importantly, THEY DO,) some have an affinity for bacchus may offer wine, and orgies. some may love ganesh, fruit, flowers... moloch/melech. baal. belial. 

Mark Passio is the go to for info 

Or it had to be hidden *from* the elite rulers, because it challenged their power. 

Hmm idea.. It might be fun to do conspiracy tarot reading!

What is by pretending to be "satanists" they scare people into christianity which may be another system they invented, that way they still have you by the balls.

Jason A isn't the man giving the lecture, he's the one who puts together the videos of others speaking.  You are right that none of the bands I listed met him personally, but his teachings were very important to them (placing Crowley on their album covers and-the-like).   It does not discredit facts like Page kidnapping a 14 year old or 100's of other allegations against him (in regards to sleeping with underage girls).  He's praised yet is just as bad as anyone from pedogate.

From West, north Texas and nowhere NM, the noble savage thing is definitely a myth, I've been to buffalo runs, and that whole "they used errything" bit is malarky.  Just because most of the native Americans trash wasn't our environment destroying atrocities doesn't mean they didn't leave it all over the place.  I've tons of arrowheads I've found.  They woulda  got there eventually. 

Not original commenter, but I'll respond.It is not inherent. This is why Christianity (the institution) has prospered (literally), as a monetary feast upon the collective guilt these masses feel.

There‚Äôs so many more resources online now than 15 years ago when I obsessed over this stuff heh.

Glad I could be of service.

Likewise.

It sounds familiar, vaguely. Please elaborate further.

It's not really aimed at proving or disproving any point in particular, rather to share the wealth of information that exists on these subjects for others to examine objectively and subsequently form their own conclusions. One point that can be taken away from the bulk of this content, while broad and covering a variety of inter-related and at times unrelated material, is the existence of certain currents or streams of esoteric (e.g. occult) knowledge passed through the centuries through key adepts, as well as their pupils and obscured often allegorically, when not utilized explicitly, by esoteric initiatory orders and secret societies. This was initially done out of necessity, to avoid persecution by the authorities of their time, and to prevent this knowledge from being abused potentially. At this point in history such an approach is no longer considered necessary, for the most part, hence the abundance and accessibly of such knowledge in the present day.To quote Immanuel Kant, who apparently plagiarized the phrase from Horace I say: Sapere aude! (Dare to know!). And to quote the infamous Aleister Crowley, who had in turn plagiarized Francois Rebelais and the Hellfire Clubs who came before him I say: Do what thou wilt! Though I would add to that, as a matter of personal preference, the hippocratic oath, in the form of: Do what thou wilt and do no harm. Speaking of esotericism, exoterically or superficially the phrase 'do what thou wilt' would appear to simply mean 'do what you want' which can be partially accurate but misses the broader and underlying meaning of the phrase. The key word in that phrase is wilt, or will, a reference to the philosophy of Thelema and of one's True Will, that is one's true and sole purpose for existence. When taken into proper context, the phrase, as intended by Crowley and possibly those before him, was meant to be regarded as an imperative to find your True Will or purpose and to strive toward that purpose in every aspect of your life, above all other priorities, apprehensions, dogmas, laws or societal norms. Of course, that phrase can and has been misused by some who wish to rationalize their own indefensible or hedonistic behavior, which if not truly their purpose or constructive toward that purpose is something that will ultimately work against them, not solely ethically or karmically (for those who consider that relevant) but in how it reflects on their character and credibility, not just in their position in their respective community or society as a whole but by their contemporaries as well as those above them in their respective hierarchy.

Gunderson isn't a primary source for any of the shit he talks about, with the notable exception of the McMartin tunnel. It seems more than likely the tunnel was a hoax, and I also find it EXTREMELY troubling that he's recommending William Guy Carr as THE GO TO SOURCE for information. Carr flat out lied about some pretty heavy shit, aside from factthat pretty much nothing in his book is sourced, at all. So, yeah, I'm saying "be careful who you listen to". 

/r/reallifeconspiracy

If that article doesn't bother you then you're not trustworthy either. 

No historical links at all.  It's a text haven.

Pop culture vs. Academia.  Even though a good portion of MPHs stuff has been refuted by historians, he was in it for the history and knowledge not fame.  It's much the same as Jared Diamond vs. Actual historians. 

> I'm glad it actually goes a little deeper.On the one hand, I'm glad when my suspicions can be validated.  On the other, I sometimes wish I was completely wrong.  Realizing the truth of all this was the biggest worldview-shattering experience I ever had, and it messed me up for well over a year.

any act of love is inherently unselfish.

No, that is not what is meant by the first law of Thelema, which is the quote above.Crowley was indeed a questionable character and he often didn't practice what he preached. And who knows what he truly practiced, the man's life was and still is in many ways shrouded in mystery.Regardless, that phrase still holds within it one of the deepest and most beautiful spiritual truths you can utter. [I actually made a comment a while back on this topic in a thread on CST](https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/77jnu5/finding_god_the_five_stages_of_grief/domsjnm/). Let me copy it here (slightly edited), since it is relevant to the discussion:-----------------------------------------------Crowley's fundamental [law of Thelema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/93_\(Thelema\)) was: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will."Although Crowley himself, as even Mark Passio once stated, is a man that one should listen to, but not copy in his actions (as he often lived quite a hedonistic lifestyle, perhaps not totally in alignment with his main teachings), this "law" is something I see very frequently as being misunderstood.By "Do what thou wilt" or "Do what you will", Crowley is implying that every being should follow their fundamental, core will, the Will that is intertwined with the whole of the Cosmos. When you follow your core Will (which is something most people are obviously **not** doing, given the state of the world), you are coming from a place of Unity. When you come from Unity your will is aligned with the will of every other being, thus following this core will, or Will, is actually one of the greatest spiritual keys and practices(this is also perhaps why he doesn't say "do what you want", but says "do what you will").Aligning yourself with your Core Will or True Will (as he states in the quote below), which is interconnected with the whole Cosmos, is one of the main keys to any spiritual practice, if not perhaps the main key.In the other part of the law he mentions "Love is the Law, love under will", which is again related to what I'm saying above. You could say that love and Will are in a way intertwined. The more Will is sourced from your Core, the more it is connected to and with love, even if the love is a mere spark, or perhaps more a sense of compassion, peace, stillness, presence.This is another quote from Crowley that shows this is what he is actually saying:>"Do not repress or restrict any true instinct of your Nature; but devote all in perfection to the sole service of your one True Will."- Aleister Crowley, Another quote from him that is quite interesting:>"IT IS WRITTEN that 'Love is the law, love under will.' Herein is an Arcanum concealed, for in the Greek Language [Agape], Love, is of the same numerical value as [Thelema], Will. By this we understand that the Universal Will is of the nature of Love. Now Love is the enkindling in ecstacy of Two that will to become One. It is thus an Universal formula of High Magick. For see now how all things, being in sorrow caused by dividuality, must of necessity will Oneness as their medicine... Understand now that in yourselves is a certain discontent. Analyse well its nature: at the end is in every case one conclusion. The ill springs from the belief in two things, the Self and the Not-Self, and the conflict between them. This also is a restriction of the Will. He who is sick is in conflict with his own body: he who is poor is at odds with society: and so for the rest. Ultimately, therefore, the problem is how to destroy this perception of duality, to attain to the apprehension of unity.- Aleister Crowley,Good sources on Thelema that I just found through Google (linked stuff pertinent to this discussion):https://sites.google.com/site/thelemaforbeginners/home/3-willhttps://sites.google.com/site/thelemaforbeginners/home/4-love

Mmm it's more about carving your own spiritual path IMHO.  Sure, going against the status quo is and can be absolutely selfish by that definition. 

You cannot say *I love you* without saying the "I" first.

You don‚Äôt get it. Notice the word Will It‚Äôs not will.Will =/= will

Good point 

Weird you'd be downvoted for that here.Where the fuck do these people come from?

Have you read about all the people he banged? And they are just the ones written about. Dude was a sexual beast. 

I read somewhere that he abandoned a fellow mountaineer and left him to die or something.

Typical Traflorkian...

That's just when they took over Hungary buddy.   Look up total mongol death toll.  Crow all you want, things are still better than theyve ever been. 

Definitely a good reference and at least a weekend of Youtube binging out there for those with the time.Especially his trivium series/lectures. 

Absolutely.  The alchemical truths shrouded in misguided *materialist fantasies of turning lead to gold* were distracted by greed. Putrefication isn't biological. It's much, much, more than that and the final product is far more valuable than what was mined and chipped into a cheap *aureus* (to buy other mens *things*).Fuck I love this thread. Great job /u/axolotl_peyotl

Marseilles or Thoth?

I think this is close.  I think they might have created Christianity as a veil for Satanism. They convince the masses to pray and god will save them.  They are the "prey".Meanwhile the satanists are very organized and put to action their plans instead of preying that they come to pass.  Religion is another way to make apathetic victims.  

You are not wrong.

Rock stars have had underage groupies throwing themselves at them for decades. Hardly anything new. 100s of allegations sounds like total bullshit made up by some Christian kook.  

Im a musician and ive studied all those musicians for decades. The crowley stuff, the zeppellin 'curse', altamont, yeah it was a thing, but to believe these guys are really satanists is incredibly ignorant. Do your own research before getting behind this. 

The key of solomon, solomon's seal...it is a puzzle. Incredibly, it leads to pleides. Pleides is also represented in stone, apparently in 43 different artifacts from around the world. The author of this site put it all together. The giza pyramids represent orion's belt. It goes from there. www.thehiddenrecords.com/key-of-solomon

/r/reallifeconspiracy

academia and pop culture seemed to have blended.  What of Manly Pee Holes stuff was proven to be wrong by historians  ? 

The world is a Dan Brown novel

Exactly. Which is why the stupid quote is contradictory. Love under will...sounds like will ranks first. No room for love if you've already ranked yourself above it.

> "Do not repress or restrict any true instinct of your Nature; but devote all in perfection to the sole service of your one True Will." - Well here's the problem then. If you don't believe that giving in to our own instincts is going to lead to selfishness and greed, not sure how to even discuss these quotes with you. Look around this world and tell me if people giving in to their own instincts has done any good at all. Sounds like Crowley was following these words just fine. You are being deceived, my friend. If I'm wrong, show me some followers of this philosophy that are just bursting at the seams with goodness and love for their fellow man. You won't. This is the opposite of love.

I guess they just really love Crowley. Or Im not allowed at the cool lunch table. It‚Äôs okay. Thanks. 

> Dude was a sexual beast.Yawn

Knowing Crowley probably after he fucked him in the ass trying to get a homunculus. 

I mean....sometimes you have to man.He's a POS but this is one example that you can't really use to diminish character. What was he supposed to do? Use magic to carry the dude down a FUCKING MOUNTAIN Hard enough to do by yourself, especially in that time. Imagine having to fully support another adult human. Impossible.

It was during his second K2 attempt. K2 is no joke, even today something like 1 in 5 people die climbing that mountain. It may be seen as a heartless thing to do (leaving someone to die) but in that kind of situation, what other choice do you have?  Keeping in mind that K2 really does not have flat sections; and you need to have true technical climbing skills.  In my opinion, if you help, you probably end up dead as well.  

Hello. I'm Dr. Glip Glop. 

Seriously my faith has been restored in the sub with this thread.  Such level discussion.  So good.

Marseilles is my go to anymore.

Mark Passio has a good rant on fake Christians.Political Christians, especially evangelicals, are a far cry from being Christ like. 

"Make apathetic victims"A comedian was just talking about this... A religious person will say something was "the will of god", and "God works in mysterious ways". Pretty good cuz the comedian said if anyone else went to their job and worked in "mysterious ways" they would be fired lol...But really "turn the other cheek"? Might as well work a shitty job for some rich fuck, if your going to heaven anyways right.

Your bias is showing.  It has nothing to do with Christians.. you can look up many other sources who say the same exact thing.  Let me ask you.. what then, if other sources who have nothing to do with religion or Christianity have said as much (lots of articles from many news sources have reported on him kidnapping a 14 year old until she was old enough to be released)?  Would you then denounce them on some faulty premise too?

Well now you've piqued my interest, mentioning a symbol of particular importance to me not just now but throughout my life, the Seal of Solomon. Most theories along this line tend to not pan out, or will take vague correlations to form a contrived narrative or pet theory. On the other hand, I have yet to find a rabbit hole I will not explore. I know that sounded foul after I typed it, but it's true, technically.

I'd disagree, just because geographic determinism is popular doesn't mean actual historians give it any creedance.  Why do you say that?  Ugh I've read a pretty darn good article on that if I can find it.  Right off the top of my head historians now very much downplay and attribute to several different cults what he attributed to Mitra.  He built quite a bit off the Mitra cults and there's very strong evidence against those lines of the mystery schools now. 

Again, interpretation is everything.Will doesn't mean self or your will to do something. It means actual action in this sense. As in, do what you do in love (as opposed to fear or hate). Again, this is just an alternative explanation. That does not mean that everyone who "follows Crowley" or wears "do what thou wilt" on a t-shirt believes that interpretation.

Will is love.Thelema = agape

Re-read my comment again. I never said one should follow their instincts, that is not what is meant by the phrase "true-will". And neither does Crowley mean that, as he states that this will comes from your Nature (capitalized - thus this means your deep self, not your surface avatar/persona or your physical animalistic self)."True-will", in this interpretation (in the spiritual and esoteric sense) is meant as your core will beyond your egoic instinctual, primal or selfish desires. Beyond what you want only for yourself there are desires within you that are born as a result of your innermost nature, which is intertwined and in unity with the whole Cosmos. Your deepest desires, you will find, are actually not only your own. If you meditate, introspect and look deeply enough within, you will find a will, a source of desire that is your own and personal, yet also transpersonal. This is reflective of your deepest nature as an inntrinsic part (as well as paradoxically the whole) of the Divine web that is weaved out of all things that exist.To put it simply-  what you *really* want, from a deep place within, from beyond the ego, from beyond pure separation, yet still from an individuated standpoint (paradoxically intertwined with the whole), is what the whole Cosmos, the whole of reality wants as well. Creating and acting from that place is inevitably acting in love, with the energy of love. For love is a hallmark of unity, not of separation.You are not not just a drop in the ocean, you are the entirety of the ocean. You are both the drop and the sea, the part and the whole. And coming your deepest self is also coming to your deepest will - your "true-will" as Crowley states it. That will is your own both from your individual standpoint as well as from the standpoint of the whole, the bigger you.That is why following your true will is what gives birth to a deeper realization of yourself and your ultimate/deeper unity with the all. Knowing who you are, knowing what you truly want - all these things are connected, one realization leads to another. And all of the realizations inevitably lead to and are linked with - love. 

I think you're still missing the point of what is meant by "will" in the quote.  It is not about "giving in to our instincts", but about finding a deeper connection with nature, life, God, the Dao, whatever you want to call it, and allowing that connection to guide you.  Wikipedia has a pretty good [short summary on True Will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Will) that might help.It's not meant to encourage hedonism, and I think it's unfair to let Crowley's lifestyle detract from his writings.  It's possible to understand a truth and still be unable to follow it; there are plenty of priests from any religion I could point to as example (or even my own fat ass, with all its knowledge of diet & exercise).  Sometimes knowledge isn't enough to stifle the desire for a vice.

This got caught in the spam filter. I paused a second before approving it to admire the irony. ;)

until you think about possible offspring that came from these couplings. not nearly as yawn as you'd think.

JFC, you're probably right. that we're even having this discussion is inspiring. they burn our libraries, and set us back a few thousand years every time we figure out their ruse. amazing times we're in.

Yes..

That's unfortunate.

There was another thread of someone explaining their views on the Saturn Death Star Cult, and it turned into a very interesting discussion as well.

I know ;)In a Crowley thread talking down the Thoth deck?Blasphemy!

agree, it's been a while since i've listened to him but it's awesome to here the perspective of an x-satanic priest.

hahah i think i've seen that

Show your source about kidnapping a 14 year old and hundreds of others

They way he explained the freemason 1st tracing (I'm not a mason but I assume that is what they do) to the DC monument on Dec 25. Incredible 

Intent influences interpretation

Link?

Glad you agree and are aware of his work. Just felt the need to add this:He is not just a EX-satanic priest. He is the most well-read occultist out there actively trying to spread wisdom and knowledge. He is literally the only person I have found who not only lays out the "what" of occultism, but on The Who, when, where and why it is being occulted and and to what nefarious end. People need to wake up and take accountability for their own ignorance and actions.

Possibly, however bare in mind with esoteric symbols there are typically multiple meanings, or layers of meanings, attributed to them.  I would take any unconfirmed theories with a grain of salt, consider it in degrees of plausibility, see how it stacks up to corroborating evidence and keep an open mind. At minimum, it makes for a fascinating thought experiment, something to contemplate objectively.

None of that even accuses or mentions kidnapping but lets not let  facts get in the way of making things up to pursue an agenda.

This is one of my favorite examples of lost technology. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanismIt is an analog/mechanical computer dated between 87 BC and 205 BC.This is not to claim that the tech was better than our current standards, but " is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks."Also, this was clearly not unique or the first of its kind. "The quality and complexity of the mechanism's manufacture suggests that it has undiscovered predecessors made during the Hellenistic period."

I'm always fascinated by how geography has changed in the time of human civilization. In Classical Antiquity, for example, North Africa was more fertile and you could walk from India to Sri Lanka.

Hey everybody. So I've been into theories of ancient civilizations ever since I discovered Graham Hancock, but today I wanted to link you guys to a crazy thread that really blew my mind.[Alterwelt's "Remote Viewing" of the past](http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2702754/pg1)Here's some backstory. So this guy started a thread on Godlike Productions' forum saying he can remote view ancient civilizations. His username was Alterwelt and he allowed users to post questions.The threads that followed are fucking crazy. Even if what he said wasn't true, it is incredibly fascinating. I wish everything he said could be made into a crazy book series.I haven't been able to get it off my mind ever since. Let me know what you guys think.EDIT: Here is an example of a Q&A from a later thread (There were several reaching close to 300 pages for some threads)Question: Who built Puma Punku?Answer: The first structures were built over 32.000 years ago by the colonists from the atlantic landmasses.The sites were abandoned after a global war and left desolate for almost 12.000 years, then some 18.000 to 16.000 years B.C it was rebuilt by the second wave of colonists from the Atlantic.It then served as a great port for the ships arriving to the region via lake Titicaca and a landing base for airships travelling deeper inland.After the Younger Dryas it's population was wiped out by the flood and earthquakes, finally some 9.000 years B.C it was resettled again by a small group of survivors from one of the last civilized areas in the Atlantic, these were driven off by the distant ancestors of the Aymara Indians and scattered across South America leaving the site desolate.If you guys find Alterwelts thread from 2014 interesting, I can try and dig up the other ones. I think there's maybe 2-3 total starting in 2014, with the above question being from a thread of his from 2016.EDIT - I started a post with all the links to every thread from Alterwelt in case anyone wanted it all in one place. Enjoy!https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8brzls/remote_viewing_of_ancient_civilizations/

If anyone wants to read a serious intellectual book which will convince you of the merits of Atlantis existing in the past I suggest *Cataclysm: Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C* by D S Allan and J B Delair. It goes through geological and mythological evidence, is sourced and cited in an academic manner and contains a wealth of information on the subject. After reading this I was amazed it wasn't common knowledge given all the evidence in favour of it. If you are a hardcore skeptic and want scientific evidence that Atlantis once existed in this world read this book. I have an old thread broadstroking it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/6r0ldi/book_review_cataclysm_compelling_evidence_of_a/) as well as a link to an ebook version of the book :).

Could anyone who's good on Google Earth trace a line or a coordinate to Antartica from this, if it alignes there maybe something's there.https://ancient-code.com/ancient-code-ancient-sites-that-align-in-a-nearly-perfect-circle-around-earth/

Atlantis is said to be the fourth root race; we're the fifth, just starting out -- very exciting to think about:- [Root Races From The Beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLHpNBf2hvM)This playlist, to me, sets the framework for understanding Atlantis, Lemuria, Hyperborea, and Polaris -- takes the "woo woo" and the scientific and joins them together into something that makes sense:- [The Growing Earth, Yuga Cycle, Sirius B Connection](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7zhSARqcOEtsz7sZMVXke2tT-tNtJ5Or)tl;dr: The spiral orbit of our Sun with Sirius A, both around the brown dwarf Sirius B, is a sort of "engine" that drives the development and, ultimately, ascension/descension of species on Earth.Also, a couple great subreddits that are all over this topic:/r/alternativehistory/r/culturallayer

I am fascinated by this subject. Recently, I read "Lemuria: Lost Continent of the Pacific" by Wishar Cerve (actually a nom de plume for H. Spencer Lewis). It is a fascinating book, which lead me to Mt. Shasta and the [Klamath Falls petroglyphs.](https://www.google.com/search?q=petroglyphs+klamath+falls&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwj4i7g7HaAhXrjVQKHTRtA4gQ_AUICigB&biw=1380&bih=799)I did some more research and found a striking similarity to petroglyphs located at [Lake Winnemucca, Nevada](https://www.google.com/search?q=petroglyphs+klamath+falls&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwj4i7g7HaAhXrjVQKHTRtA4gQ_AUICigB&biw=1380&bih=799) and [Painted Rock, California.](https://www.google.com/search?q=san+luis+obispo+petroglyphs+painted+rock&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi2ityihLHaAhXrzlQKHUrRC5UQ_AUICygC&biw=1380&bih=799)Then, after doing a little more digging, I found a resemblance to the [Caroline Islands Script](https://www.google.com/search?q=caroline+islands+script&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijgrK6hPrZAhVE_mMKHVcNBwYQ_AUICigB&biw=1380&bih=799#imgrc=4XV__UXiAFraMM:) from the South Pacific, near Papua New Guinea. Could this point to a common root language dating back to lost Lemuria? Curious to hear everyone's thoughts!

if you like lost civilizations (including our own!) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CulturalLayer/) is subreddit about it all and a [quick reference list](https://www.reddit.com/r/CulturalLayer/comments/85wlrq/best_of_rculturallayer_and_resource_guide/)

i would love to see excavations of proposed sites of coast lines in areas thought to be populated pre melt off.most of the human population is situated near coasts, the huge melt of ~12k years ago, the seas rose and any city located on the coast would not be in the ocean near the coast.

 

The Annunaki haven't come since they flooded the shit out of us. So yeah, lost civilizations of the ancients had some way better technology than us. Our technology hasn't really put us in a good position, we burn too much coal instead of making giant natural energy harvesters, or pyramids. 

Just finished reading *The History of Atlantis* and *Occult Science in Atlantis* by Lewis Spence. Almost finished with *Atlantis: Mother of Empires* by Robert Stacy-Judd. These are must reads for anyone interested in the subject, in my opinion.Both researchers theorize that there were three major waves of immigration from Atlantis to Europe and the Americas corresponding to three great cataclysms suffered by Atlantis, along with periodic colonization of both areas in between. These cataclysms and subsequent waves occurred in approximately 23,000 BC, 14,000 BC, and 9,600 BC, with the latter being the final cataclysm described by Plato in the Timaeus and Critias. These three waves correspond to the Aurignacian, Magdalenian, and Azilian-Tardenoisian cultures in Europe, respectively. They also correspond to the pre-Mound Builders, Mound Builders, Toltecs, Aztecs, and Mayans in America.Curious to hear if anyone else has read these books, and what there take on them is!

Damn I can't wait to dig into this. This is the cray cray. 

I think that the Biblical flood, and many other floods in our collective history have been caused by a 2nd star in our solar system, a dead black star passing through our inner solar system every few thousand years.  I also think that it's due to come back around soon, and that David Bowie hid its location on the vinyl version of his Blackstar album.  There is an image of a star field on it that was found some time after the album came out that can only be seen in UV light.  I also think that this is the biggest secret of all of the secret societies like the Freemasons, that they have kept from us "profane" for millenia.  Tubal-Cain is the password of the Master Mason and IMO alludes to this concept in an allegorical way.  Here's a link to an article that mentions the album Blackstar having more secrets to be revealedhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180129031308/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7573607/david-bowie-blackstar-hidden-secretsI think that if we were to point a sufficiently powerful telescope towards the center of the included image which was cropped from this larger imagehttp://hubblesite.org/image/1338/news_release/2003-15that we might be able to detect it in time to prepare for its inevitable return.

This is my favorite video explaining Lemuria and the Nacals. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swe3EOKCbFI

Does anyone know about in depth research on Aboriginal Australian  memory sticks?  There is some mainstream work i heard about on the Mysterious Universe.  They had the author of the Memory Code, Lynne Kelly, as a guest and she mentioned some interesting things about the Aboriginal timeline.  She also mentioned that while there is no true written history there are sticks passed generation to generation that go back 10s of thousands of years.  The book was a good start but it tries to take on too much in too little space.  I would like to find a good place to start to see if there is a connection between memory sticks, the French cave paintings, and imagery in the southwest United States.  From what little in the way of decent sources I found I think there may be far better tangible evidence for a great civilization at least 50,000 years ago.  I think that due to their isolation the Aboriginal history may be an outstanding resource.  Over time this has eroded, but not as much as say ancient African or Middle Eastern history.  The problem I have is a majority of easy to find material is written with the modern bias of written civilization being 6,000 years old.  If anyone knows of anything specific to Australia that would help me get started I would appreciate it.  

I have the perfect thing for this topic actually... a Canadian Atlantis (along with some other curious geo formations).When I was browsing the global map, I saw a circular ring shaped land mass that reminded me a bit of the classic descriptions of Atlantis. The neat, circular design of the ring shape makes me think it was deliberately designed and could possibly be Atlantis or some other similar advanced city. I haven't seen this area discussed much by other people either... its a very odd, unnatural looking crater in Canada called Manicougan crater:Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manicouagan_ReservoirMap: https://binged.it/2queJXiIt just doesn't seem like a natural formation to me cause comets/asteroids usually make craters at an angle (so oval/irregular shape) and usually cause a crater depression that would cause a pit that gets deeper toward the center, which would form a lake or something but this crater is a ring shape, where the land in the center is raised/normal instead of more caved in and a ring of water around it like a moat. As I was doing more research I found out that it also has a dam to contain the water in the reservoir and was surprised to find out that I recognized it from something..... the Weapon X program in the Wolverine Origins movie! Its the same dam that wolverine was locked up in for mutant experiments, and I have seen that dam used in other movies/shows as well (usually in an ominous setting). I actually think there is a real secret government base in there, along with some mysterious history to the location itself, which is what inspired those movie producers to include the dam in their films. It could be ancient atlantis that has been covered up to hide their technology and keep it secret, or an underground government base/bunker, or even something alien related where they used it as a stargate or visual marker and use the site for secret genetic testing. Could be a variety of things, but I just can't see it being a simple meteorite crater from what I see. I've actually considered making a road trip up there to check it out myself in person, esp that inner circle of the "Eye of Quebec". I'm sure exploring the area would be worth it regardless, prob find some ancient artifacts or meteorite rocks.... maybe get abducted and given mutant powers, or just plain abducted which would kinda suck lol. I have always thought Canada has some secrets that haven't been discovered yet, or are intentionally being kept hidden. I find it interesting that they have such strict rules for crossing the border into Canada, so like people with a DUI or certain "flags" won't be allowed in... they're very selective. There is also tons of wild territory that has not been fully explored with only a few small settlements around. Most of the population of Canadians lives in the bottom 1/3 of the country, while the top 2/3 is wild Yukon territory that only the native inuit "First Nations" Indians live in.First Nations and the "Canadian Shield" geographic area is another point too cause I think the First Nations tribes have a very ancient historical past in the north that isn't publicized much but shows up in their beliefs. With climate/pole shifts that whole northern arctic area could have been more habitable in the past like they say about antarctica. The whole Canadian shield area in general seems kinda odd to me too with its unique shield shape... you can tell that it used to be one land mass that was shattered into smaller pieces by meteorites. There is that theory about a huge meteorite that could have crashed and created the Hudson bay and then broke off into smaller pieces multiple times as it arced downward, making the great lakes and other smaller lakes in Midwest/east coast of US. Aside from that tho, there are other known meteorite sites up there that are mined for ore and even give off magnetic anomalies. Its just a strange area. But yea... Canada has some interesting and mysterious features that I hope we will learn more about eventually. 

[A fun one - the flying machine found under the pyramids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q8dhYriBYw)

My theory on Atlantis:According to what I've read, it was supposed to be due West of the straight of Gibraltar and be around 230miles by 345 miles large (measured in stades). I forget where I read it, but it was also a few day boat ride to get there, which based on Roman boats, that would place it around the Portuguese Azores area. If you look in Google earth, there is a land mass of roughly 345 miles wide and 230miles tall.  The problem is that even if you account for a 400 ft rise in sea level, it still would be under water. This is where a recent discovery helps us out. If you look into the pyramids found off the coast of Cuba, you will see a city that is 2000ft below sea level. You might ask why this matters. If you look at tectonic plates, this is on the edge between the north American plate and the plate right below. Guess what! The location of Atlantis in the azores is also on the edge of the tectonic plate between north america and the plate to the east. How could the whole ridge be raised you ask? Well it is like a boat on an ocean of magma with a huge iceberg on the northern side. When this was destroyed at the end of the ice age 10800 years ago (Thanks Graham Hancock), this caused the whole plate to level itself.  Another item that coincides is the report of the circle nature of a portion of Atlantis. If you look on the eastern edge, you will see an old crater. If this was above water, it would have given Atlantis its shape.

Anyone think the aztecs were an extension of ancient egypt?

One recommendation I have for people is to really dive into the second volume of H.P. Blavatsky's book ["The Secret Doctrine"]( http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd-hp.htm). That's where the foundation of the modern ideas of Lemuria etc. and much on Atlantis come from. There's been a lot of outgrowth of those ideas, some more fantastic than others, since Blavatsky, and not all is compatible with what she wrote.The Secret Doctrine is one hell of a dense read, but worth it if you can stick with it. Volume 2 lays out the theosophical version of the history of humanity and is beyond interesting. Volume 1 lays out the theosophical view of cosmogony. 

Humorous prose with some poignant pointshttps://www.cracked.com/article_16871_6-insane-discoveries-that-science-cant-explain.html

One of my favorite reads is Adam and Eve from The Urantia Papers. This I believe was the story of Atlantis or the First Garden of Eden that sunk beneath the waters.Here is a snippet.ADAM AND EVE arrived on Urantia, from the year A.D. 1934, 37,848 years ago. It was in midseason when the Garden was in the height of bloom that they arrived. At high noon and unannounced, the two seraphic transports, accompanied by the Jerusem personnel intrusted with the transportation of the biologic uplifters to Urantia, settled slowly to the surface of the revolving planet in the vicinity of the temple of the Universal Father. All the work of rematerializing the bodies of Adam and Eve was carried on within the precincts of this newly created shrine. And from the time of their arrival ten days passed before they were re-created in dual human form for presentation as the world‚Äôs new rulers. They regained consciousness simultaneously. The Material Sons and Daughters always serve together. It is the essence of their service at all times and in all places never to be separated. They are designed to work in pairs; seldom do they function alone.https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-74-adam-and-eve

I like the theory that 'atlantis' was either in the Mediterranean Sea or the Persian gulf. The Persian gulf is particularly interesting, because the book of Genesis describes Eden as the place where the euphrates and Tigris converge. If you consider that 10-20k years ago the oceans were low enough that the gulf would have been dry, then it would make sense for the first civilization to have started there. Then perhaps there was some rapid melting of ice which quickly raised ocean levels, perhaps even the release of massive lakes held back by ice dams, such as the one that stretched across North America in the Pacific Northwest. The Mediterranean also could have had an ice dams in the strait of Gibraltar that released a tidal wave into the Mediterranean Sea.

Finally, some of my favourite topics !!

Atlantis isn't lost or missing, it is hidden.

Ancient Mesopotamia was really advanced!

A little late to the party here but [Randall Carlson had a great talk about Atlantis being revived by Modern science](https://youtu.be/oWaWcURBZPQ) and the evidence he provides about global flooding and cataclysms is among the best I've seen.

Atlantis had the color blue. 

Smithsonian just recently supported evidence, and put a documentary out on the Tower of Babel really existing. It was built around 500 BCE by Nebuchadnezzar, and was actually a 300 foot tall Ziggurat.(https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/videos/some-very-compelling-evidence-the-tower-of-babel-was-real/55877)

Namaste.  

heres my personal theory. There was once was great civilisation 12000 years ago. There was geological evidence was meteor hitting the ice caps . The caused huge catastrophe . By hitting the ice caps the water leval went up dramatically . that could explain why alot of ancient structures are under water. Then the surviors of the metor spilt apart and made their own sub culture. This could explain why Egyptians and all other empires that related during that time were similar. Same set of gods . A god king a jelous brother that wants the throne etc. Also adds explain why alot pyrmids mad during that time. Dont really have a clue about what caused the collaspe of the bronze age. to be honest . I wrote this half assed and im sorry. i dont enjoy typing on phone i actually edit later on my computer when get a chance.also if like history and suppressed archeogly and debunking of archeological theories then. watch Bright insight god i love his channel. also mystry history too. this what got me into the fringe

Great topic. I'd be interested in gathering some good literature surrounding these (sources that aren't way out there, i.e. nothing channeled). Right now the work of Ignatius Donnelly, Plato, Arysio Santos and Otto Muck are the most trustworthy in my opinion.

Maybe atlantis was destroyed by something similar to a nuclear bomb (maybe studying nuclear fusion. The description of the downfall of atlantis sounds like a nuclear bomb went off.). And after (or while atlantis was sinking) they sunk they migrated to agartha ü§î

r/alternativehistory would be more appropriate. 

Not really Atlantis related but definitely alternate history.Egyptians in Australia?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXGsYFblCqQMakes you wonder if there were civilizations which navigated the globe long before Europeans did.

commenting so i can find this later.  cheers all.

One of my favorite lectures/series on the subject is done by Michael Tsarion.  He has several hour long programs that delve deep into Atlantis and Ancient civilizations (his Irish Origins of Civilization is also great).  Check out Origins & Oracles, Atlantis Alien Visitation and Genetic Manipulation series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6RXPyi5gCk

Research on the EYE OF SAHARA

For anyone interested in the topic of Ancient High Technology and lost Civilizations, this show is wonderful in the scope that it covers in regards to legitimate scientific hypothesis in regards to these theories.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1806688/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f90RHAQVNUMThey take a few episodes to lay out the groundwork behind the theories but by the end of it, it really wraps up the science behind the hypothesis wonderfully.  Highly recommend this series for anyone interested in the subject.Quote from the series "The Pyramid Code is a documentary series of 5 episodes that explores the pyramid fields and ancient temples in Egypt as well as ancient megalithic sites around the world looking for clues to matriarchal consciousness, ancient knowledge and sophisticated technology in a Golden Age."

I still think constantly about where we would be if the Library of Alexandria would have never been burned. I feel like there would have been info on all this.

Check out the Disc of Sabu, it looks like it could have been part of some kind of ancient machinery[*SCHIST DISC](https://www.google.co.uk/search?safe=off&client=firefox-b-ab&dcr=0&biw=1600&bih=788&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=MTnWWtvbHKyNgAai84jwCA&q=schist+disk+&oq=schist+disk+&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i30k1j0i5i30k1j0i24k1l2.3176.3176.0.3974.1.1.0.0.0.0.100.100.0j1.1.0....0...1c..64.psy-ab..0.1.100....0.iAf1CS9E_os)

I remember reading a question in college English about the reasons Shakespeare had for having a mechanical clock chime in Julius Caesar when ancient Rome "obviously didn't have mechanical clocks."When you think about traditional watchmakers, how solitary their work is and how few people it would take to either pass on the knowledge or destroy it completely, it makes you wonder about the quiet corners of humanity where arcane knowledge resides.

Wow. TIL. Thank you for blowing my fucking mind today.

It's truly amazing. [Clickspring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML4tw_UzqZE) is reconstructing it using only ancient methods. It's really fascinating. 

It was supposedly 'rediscovered' in 1901. Is it possible that it is a forgery, a hoax, a ruse?

Gears =/= computer. I feel this example is very sensationalized. And realizing the relationship between a few gears and time does not a computer make. What am i missing?

You ever wonder what‚Äôs under all that sand?

Have you seen... I think it was Nik Research who made the observation that probably a thunderbolt.. from the sun? or from some passing planet scarred our planet from around Nepal to Africa. It sounds pretty mad to begin with, until you watch the testable hypotheses from the Thunderbolts of the Gods (Symbols from an Alien Sky) youtube vid. and take in google maps from a zoomed out point. One can see the proposed arch through the Middle East too, between these points. It's as good as an explanation as any I've heard so far. NASA images of Mars show the same sort of scarring.

And then you have Doggerland which is now completey undersea. 

>  geography has changed in the time of human civilizationWhat evidence do we have that this is the case?

This is ridiculously interesting, thank you for this.I do believe that humans have FAR more history than what we're being told (the ~10k years of human settlements we're fed is a joke). That said, statements like this:>During the second high period of civilization solar power, magnetic propulsion, artificially grown crystalline hardware were commonplace....and others where he mentions that we had bases on the moon and explored the inner solar system. I do find this all hard to believe. We have a large amount of proof of the dinosaurs but not a single shred of evidence that any of these societies existed? I want to believe. Hahaha :)

On like page 11, and a lot of this makes sense and its scary af. This comment confuses me though: "I dont buy this one, sorry. Your are good though. What would we lose if we knew our past? What would the elite lose if there is no sinister agenda behind? Quoting: MatjazReligious people would be forced to forfeit their beliefs. Archeologists, philosophers and others would be forced to admit their knowledge is insufficient and concerning the history they know as little as a common person.Reverse engineering the renewable energy sources would deprive vast companies of their income, cheap and effective medical technologies would undermine the medical complex and so on.The change of this magnitude is too much for a great many people."The people who would lose the most, would be those who are more accustomed toward enslavement being a practice/norm, the elites who require peons to even provide them things to spend their money on. He speaks of a great war between a "slave loving" society/civilization vs a "we are all equal" society/civilization a few pages before, I believe its simple to realize those who wanted to enslave, won. EDIT: I like one thing: "Were you able to find out what the other side is like? Should we have no worries or do everything we can to stay alive? Quoting: Anonymous Coward 65480503Also were they able to create artificial intelligence?

This is odd, either fear, due to seeing something or finding something out unsettling, or being told to simply not discuss it for a reason. Very awkward. He COULD have said Roswell was just a USA proto-type, but instead steered RIGHT away from it, specific...FINAL EDIT: I believe this to be a psy-op of some type. This person has edited and removed comments, and has stated several times he doesn't have knowledge on a specific topic, and 15-25 pages later, is talking about it. They also state there are no aliens, and then later state that there are aliens but didn't interfere with past civilizations.Something about all of this smells fishy. He won't touch on anything metaphysical, within a post that is sourced through a metaphysical means, FISHIER THAN r/cutefish. 

This thread is awesome! Thank you for sharing it. :)

Oh my gosh thanks for the share! I wish he talk about spiritual things though. He said he doesn't comment on spiritual questions. 

I noticed Alterwelt talked about the Voynich Manuscript:"Re: Remote Viewing Ancient Civilizations - a compilation of data.What is the voynich manuscript and what language was used in it? What was its purpose and who created it? Quoting: Anonymous Coward 56184035 It's not written in a language, its written in a cypher using a dead language. It was a message from one representative of a secret society to his colleagues. It's not meant for the casual reader."According to this article it has been decoded- https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/the-mysterious-voynich-manuscript-has-finally-been-decoded/ So maybe it's all just really well-worded bullshit? I don't know. I read a bunch of these pages and their answers seem plausible, but this one is just bugging me. I mean, maybe his answer isn't wrong, just conveniently worded?

This is fascinating, thank you for sharing! It also fits in really well with the research on Atlantis by Lewis Spence and Robert Stacy-Judd, seeming to confirm many of their hypotheses about waves of Atlantean colonists to the Americas.

>  The first structures were built over 32.000 years ago by the colonists from the atlantic landmasses.How do they arrive at these dates and ages?

I did not agree to the TOU and it sent me to disney.com hehe

Jesus looks like I‚Äôm not sleeping tonight 

Unless I am mistaken, someone was browsing /x/ recently ;) That's how I found that thread, I didn't get to finish it but damn that was an interesting read.I honestly think a lot of what the guy says COULD be right, a lot of it fits - and he seemed to have a really deep knowledge of many subjects - and was honest when confronted with things he did not remote view (ie: Excalibur).

Well, i wont be doing any work today.

> So this guy started a thread on Godlike Productions' forum saying he can remote view ancient civilizations.What is "remote viewing"? And how can it be used to examine civilizations from the past? It sounds like you're describing telepathic time-travel.

Sounds very interesting, how academic is it?

> After reading this I was amazed it wasn't common knowledge given all the evidence in favour of it.Maybe there's a reason it's not common knowledge. Denying the Ice Age theory is a pretty huge claim. How have other scientists responded to it? Links would be ideal.Also, could you link some bios of those authors? I wasn't able to find a source for them being professors. Couldn't find where they got their PhDs or where they had their appointments.

Sandy Islands are very common old school map making stuff.Map makers would add things in that were fake, when it reapered in another map they would know it was copied.No one does this now, maps are not rare or valuable today.  But I could see some stuff getting left in for a few generations of maps until someone figured it out 

And when this landmasses movement happened?

> The location of new zealand has shifted far southOn what do you base this claim?

i remember the land mass near Australia, but our location in the milky way changing is still the change that blows my mind more than any other..besides maybe fruit of the loom not having a cornicopia

Stories passed down through generations I suspect.  Much like the stories in the bible were passed down for 600 years before they were written up.

I wonder what our fate will be this time. 

Annunaki is the base of all religion

This seems relevant: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_flood_myth the original flood story 

Interesting. If not too far fetched. The star could mean any number of other things. 

But why would David Bowie know?

I think that they sent down a nuke. Have you heard about the "Eye of sahara" 

I like this rabbit hole. The only thing keeping me from it is that such star would have been detected by its gravitational influence in the solar system. Objects as small as Pluto were derived/predicted from such gravitational irregularities using Newton's mechanics. Einstein's general relativity is even more precise.   The only way for such a black star to exist is if it is not a normal black star but an intelligent custom built one made by advanced extraterrestrial beings who possess mastery over gravity and matter. 

Could a 10th planet also affect the earth if it passed close by?

this was a good vid, i also recommend

Ya, it was called the younger dryas.

>Makes you wonder if there were civilizations which navigated the globe long before Europeans did.Possible as Jpmon out of southern  Okinawa/Taiwan.and southern Japan region sailed to Western Chile region 4000 plus y ears ago,, and Polynesians form Lapita culture sailed throughout the Pacific as well. Alos Ainu out of Northern  Japan and Siberia sailed along the Ice Shelf fir the Ice age around the edge, and followed to America.>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXGsYFblCqQInteresting link. I need more time to watch. BTW the Omani at the end of the Arabian peninsula along the Indian ocean. Also had an empire that ranged from Southern Africa along uo the east coast to Ethiopia all the way to India and on to China as well for the spice trade. This started 1000 years BCE. They then stored the spices like Frankincense and Myrrh and other spices and traveled along the Frankincense trail to Egypt and Palestine to trade

huh?

The disks that predate sumerian civilization? 

Looks like it could be used for making pottery, which they had at the time.

In-Q-Tel

Everything's possible. To my mind it'd probably not be as old as wiki states. You see things like the half-built temples in the rock face in Lycia and just think, Fuck man, what the hell happened. This stuff existed alright, but how old it is and who built it and how can we get that excellent clean tech back is a more important question imho.

The technology is on par with AD 1300s technology despite being as old as 200 BC. How was that technology lost and why did it take a thousand years before we got back to that level of advancement?>Analog computer used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendar and astrological purposes decades in advance

Electronic Computers =/= Only kind of ComputerThe gears are designed in such a way that they can follow celestial bodies and predict astronomical events like eclipses. Basically the design of the gears and how they interacted was the software and the hardware. It has 1 set of built in inputs to start the computation. The movement of the gears is the actually computing part and the resulting visuals from the gear movement signaled different outputs. Input, computation, output = Basic Computer

Actually what we know as a computer would be an electronic computing device. Anything that does computations is called a computer. An abacus is still a calculator, but when we think of calculators we think of electronic ones. I understand where you‚Äôre coming from though 

Compute = computerCompute the lights in the sky = computer?Modern computers are faster and more dynamically defined (programs).  But the general concept of automating computation is clearly seen in this mechanism (one program)

a computer is a mechanism that does computing... whats there to miss this device was used to compute thus a computer.

Ever heard of a mechanical computer? or do you think all computers need a mouse and a keyboard?

> Gears =/= computer.What do you think that "computer" means?

It's not just gears though, the gears maintain several different states, so it has sort of a "memory" much like a calculator or computer. Early computers were analog and worked like this too, I'm thinking of punchcards.

Update the wikipedia article please.EDIT: Also explain where anything I personally commented about this was debunked.

> Our ancient ancestors are the same as modern humans.From your article.  This statement is so patently false that it entirely throws the rest of their conclusions out the window.  

 

A lot. I think about it a lot.

You see what they just found in that reservoir in Mexico?  Pretty fucking awesome.

The original cities of the original Israelites.(Not the new Israelis, just to be clear.)

No. I hate sand. It gets everywhere.

You ever wonder why it's all just sand and not rock?

Now connect planetary size electric arcs with a conspiracy to add a few hundred years to our calendar.

The theory of the plasmaverse helps making this claim more believable.

Pls explain or provide link

Is that in the area between the British Isles and Europe? Whenever I talk with my mother about ancient civilizations she brings up Doggerland.I've heard saying that most people make settlements along coastlines, and i've also heard that a few thousand years ago the sea level may have been up to 400m lower than today, which I think would leave many of todays seaside towns high and dry

Here's a good Ancient Architects video on Doggerland. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvOcK4wfIHo

> What evidence do we have that this is the case?The massive sea level rise that happened at the end of the ice age covered up massive amounts of land.

I am in the same boat as you here. I believe human history travels further back than has been told in history books but sometimes people take it too far.It's why I love listening to Graham Hancock, good realistic ideas

When I stumbled across that post it was like the first time I ever saw the website. I even got a couple questions in to the OP (Alterwelt) before he disappeared.The whole thing is freaking crazy, and I love it. He's very convincing, and the answers he gives seem plausible most of the time. It's my personal opinion that if high technology existed during these "high periods of civilization" I wouldn't be surprised to find that evidence has been eradicated from the face of the earth due to time. If so much of the earths population lives so close to the coastlines now, imagine what would happen if we were hit with a cataclysmic flood. [Here is a cool video showing the earth if all the ice melted.](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-earth-would-look-like-if-ice-melted-world-map-animation-2015-2) That would raise the sea levels by 216 feet. Many of our most populated areas would be underwater. Florida would essentially be completely underwater.Makes you wonder what kind of historical record we would leave behind if we went through a cataclysm similar to the one Alterwelt or Graham Hancock talk about.

Bro, dinosaurs were a plant from the winners/survivors of the ancient world's previous golden era. Cmon, the 'illuminati' of the ancient past could have created some NWO type of deal. Starting bioengineering bones and using some cern type stuff to speed up decay. Then creating an 'ice age' using climate control, and controlling the only fertile land in the world. Then creating a testament to the new world. These days those kind of technologies seem to be obtainable in only decades. Maybe somewhere out there the true history of the world exists, I bet it's interesting.

Have you ever heard the theory of humans being from mars / a planet that was destroyed and is now the asteroid belt? Supposedly our biological clock in space is exactly the same clockwise as being on or around mars orbit 

Well this theory relies on the government or TPTB or whoever trying to hide this from us. He said on I think page 4 that there are many artifacts at the Smithsonian. Only thing is why go so out if your way to hide that these civilizations existed?

> I do believe that humans have FAR more history than what we're being told (the ~10k years of human settlements we're fed is a joke).That sounds really interesting. Why do you say that? Could you share some sources?

It's almost like we need a Great Awakening or something! 

I disagree with your post and here‚Äôs why:These billion dollar companies could pivot if this technology was available to be reversed engineered in no fucking time. The medical companies don‚Äôt want it known because it would reduce their income? Fuck no. They would be selling these crystals or whatever at vast amounts of money in a second. Unlimited energy? The oil companies would pivot and get cheap, renewable energy to be resold in another second.For real. There‚Äôs tons of money to made if it‚Äôs true and reversible. The new found tech would make it easier to make a ‚Äúslave society‚Äù, not harder. Think of the weapons, the control, the power and shit they could build with this new tech.That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think this is real. Because someone would be greedy and using it already.

I agree with your post. I noticed that the answerer unconvincingly pivoted from a question about crop circles as well. I wonder if the answerer and his team are either purposeful disinformation agents (likely), or they are a team of powerful viewers and they have certain walls, veils, or limitations that they can't (or won't) see through. Have you heard any scuttlebut that Godlike Productions is a CIA honeypot or something? I've stumbled upon that notion once or twice but I don't have a link or source for that. 

To be fair about the aliens part..I literally only read page one, where he says all of our civilization has been terrestrial alone.But he doesn't say aliens DON'T exist.I haven't read further to what else he says about them, so it's quite possible he does contradict that very specific claim above. 

You're welcome! I'm glad you are enjoying it.

I believe he does answer some questions as to religious figures as actual people somewhere among the threads.

No it was ancient Turkish. Someone actually cracked it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6keMgLmFEk

I hadn't heard about Spence or Judd. I'll have to check that out!

I wish I knew!

I've never heard of /x/, but I personally came across Alterwelt completely by accident when I was browsing godlike productions several years ago. I haven't been able to get it out of my head ever since and felt this thread was a perfect place to share it. 

> Remotehttps://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/

Hundreds of references to academic papers per chapter, it's almost overwhelming. It's written by two teachers so they've done their homework. 

Never said they were professors. Is that important? 

While I'm still not sure I buy the whole root races thing, various groups seem to think something important will be happening in 2025.What I find interesting is that 2025 will briefly at the beginning of the year be 1776 in the Julian (Roman) calendar by the reckoning of Phantom Time Hypothesis. 1776 is printed on the US $1 bill, supposedly as a representation of the founding year of the US, but it is peculiarly written in Roman numerals without the month or day, next to two Latin phrases, potentially signaling that it instead refers to J.1776. Further, one of these phrases is generally translated as "a new order for the ages", or sometimes as "a new world order", but it can also be translated as "a new class of races".

Thank you very much, this is awesome information! Just digging into it. Have a lot of respect for the Theosophists, so this is a great source!

I worded my comment vaguely thinking I would get told to elaborate or get criticized, but thank you for elaborating for me

Ahem. Staaaaaar maaaaaaan 

Are you referring to the self sustaining atomic reactor?  thats a hot one... getit... radioactive...  its a prehistory dad joke.  

Never heard of it.

I think that due to its large orbit and far distance from our inner solar system, it would be very hard to detect until it gets much closer....I dont know how far away it might currently be but I do have reasons to think that sometime in the next few years it will be back.  I have tied a number of conspiracy theories together with this being a huge factor.  Think about how the Mayan calendar ended just a few years ago....it would make sense that their calculations would be off a bit....a small error would account for a few years on that kind of scale.

Yeah thats what I used to think but now it makes much more sense to think that there is a black star out there.  There is a tattoo that some gang member have on their hand of a black star.  I think that might tie into this shit too....just another little piece of info.  I honestly have seen enough to be convinced of my theory....pop culture references veiled in allegory all over the place too.

A flying wooden boat?

Actually, aztecs aren't even a real people that's just what indigenous ppl of Mexico are called. What's referred to when people say "Aztecs" are really the one tribe that had ruled and intimidated all the other tribes.And pyramids don't come to mind? Bro nothing is common?http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/bonampak-1.htmhttps://classroom.synonym.com/sarcophagi-ancient-egypt-9094.htmlScroll along and see the pictures

That was my first time back in forever. I remembered that's where I learned about the Baigong Pipes and figured it doubled as a walk down memory lane. 

Depends on what you think the relation might be between the various species in the family Hominidae and the genus Homo, and what theosophy calls Root-Races and sub-races. Clearly there have been several major stages in the development of "Man" as we know it, and all a "race" means in theosophy is a "stage of development". But anyway, as Graham Hancock says, we're a species with amnesia. We seem to know next to nothing about our actual history and what was going on during the millions of years of big brained homo species. Perhaps major cataclysms are why we have so little knowledge or evidence. 

I couldn't stake a yae or nae to that claim, but I don't know shit about  Sumerian civilization.. and I think only a single disc has been *disc*overed

but how was *that* made

The lost chronology theory could be applied to that. Some think the church invented a few hundred years of history to make the bible work. 

I believe that this could be proof for the theory that the history as we know it has been severly tampered with, that 1000-some years were added, now known as the "dark ages" [here is a redditor's theory on it](https://xp.reddit.com/r/CulturalLayer/comments/7u0w1m/a_synopsis_of_phantom_time_theory_in_my_own_words/)

The introduction of Christianity and Islam, along with the dark ages can be attributed to that. Thanks religion.

The Roman Empire was incredibly sophisticated. Technology being on par with the 1300ADs is very vague when people were build aquifers, mixing and making concrete, etc thousands of years ago. We still don‚Äôt know all of the tech and knowledge lost when the empire collapsed. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a computer just because it resembles something like today‚Äôs.

Thats not true. Steam powered devices and gear driven mechanisms date back to 2600 bc. Meaning... the technology is on par with the time. Please google the south pointing chariot. I again ask... we do not consider gear diven time pieces to be computers, and i feel this is highly sensationalized. What am i missing? 

I have always had the feeling that humanity is the old timey tech and that when we engineer our upgrade, via nowadays computers, we then will become obsolete.Or some such...Only an unsubstantiated idea.

Please explain how manual gears predict astrological events? Not just here i mean in general? Id really like to know... the person designing gear ratios did the computing, which is very basic mariner-centric time piece. But go on... how do manual gears compute anything? You know someone turns them right? Youre an idiot, the only time you see someone say predicting astrological events on this subject.. is sensationalized youtube and conspiracy pandering content. Actual peer reviewed pub lishings cant even confirm it was a time piece with all the missing hypothetical pieces. Reality is partial housing and pieces from 2 gears do not make a computer, and do not make a magical set of gears that predicted eclipses... im done in this thread. Please add .edu and stop trying to google stuff to reafffirm your notions, learn something...

No thats what youtube says. Peer reviewed studys say it is very open for interpretation hut is a celestial calendar... didnt predict anything, just mariner centric timepiece. Kool aid...

No... just no. This thread is full of claims that only show up in sensationalized youtube vids. Please consider adding .edu when researching this. If were calling time pieces computers, sun dials were the first computers? This still isnt close within a thousand years of first gear driven time piece... factis this is pieces of 2 gears people profoundly hypothesize upon, when all peer reviewed data dates the item over a thousand years after gear driven time pieces, hydraulics and even steam powered devices and note that 'predicting astralogical events' is horseshit hearsay. This community is beyond toxic when you disagree with kool aid. Fact is this was likely used to measure time via/astralogical clock, seems more complex to modern humans because we dont know or use the stars to tell us time and location like more mariner-centric people did... and yes, its still amazing. But not omg lost civilization predicting astrological events amazing... thats horse shit.

Read all the posts... or dont. Its already been shown gears and housing alone do not possess computing ability, no interaction, easy. I went round about way of making guy arguing contradict himself. This is silly. Edit: op even edited his post...

They create a device that can *compute* calculations through a a replicatable pattern?Let me dumb it down: "a device created by humans to predict events normally done on a pad and paper or the current and local equivalent". Way to shoot yourself in the foot."Computation" doesn't mean binary and electronics.

Atlantis of the Sands II: More Sand

I didn't see that. what are you talking about? you have caught my attention. 

Thanks for the link:It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äújust found‚Äù though. The comments contain links to Mexican authorities who have been aware of the structure since the 1700s when it was abandoned due to the plague with discussions of it as recently as the 60s.

Ya links plzzz

Links dude

These fucking jokes aren't even funny. Especially when real questions are asked. It just distracts from the conversation and people don't want to share and talk about what they were about to. Because instead of thought and discussion, it will be met with pointless memes.I was actually curious what he thought was under the sand, but I bet I won't find out what he was thinking now. Sweet meme though bro!Downvote me though, go ahead. Prove /r/conspiracy is filled with 14 year olds posting shit jokes for karma coming from /r/prequelmemes. Pathetic really

I‚Äôd like to think there was water there originally. 

there are some pretty big structures under water in japan. clearly there was some big cities that are no longer with us. what I find crazy is that there are not any records of them. no cultures are like oh year we used to live in massive city X but it started getting underwater and so we moved it uphill a bit. 

Yeah and it covers even larger going out into the Atlantic and then above northern Europe were also above sea level.Maybe the island of Hy Brasil could be a final remnant of it. I also think it could be one way to try and explain the Baltic sea anomaly could explain a land civilization from around there at another date. Still absolutely no idea of its true purpose if it was made by a civilization there though.Edit: couple words

> The massive sea level riseWhat is the evidence for this claim?

I feel it's a good place to start - let's make our theory of ancient civilizations about humans - so that we KNOW it's possible, otherwise we all look like idiots...I mean, once the groundwork for the real history has been laid, if aliens show up or artifacts are found etc - then shit, okay, we can update again - better to start at the bottom and build up - rather than jump off the cliff screaming "twas aliuns!"

> I believe human history travels further back than has been told in history booksWhy do you believe this?Are you open the possibility that in fact the opposite is the case?That is, are you willing to consider the possibility that human history is in fact only a few hundred years old?

There‚Äôs a joe rogan podcast with graham taking about the water levels before the last ice age and how the sea level is much lower then it is today. So it got me thinking wouldn‚Äôt they be able to map out the old coastlines of these ancient cities? Maybe they do and keep it from the public or simply the ocean is just to big to effectively search its depths. 

Over the course of the past few days, little by little, I've gone through all 286 pages (skipping through to Alerwelt's replies).>Buddhism got many things wrong. Jesus got all of them right.They go on and on about Jesus. Saying that he was genetically just a man, but he came to understand all of creation. OP elsewhere mentions that modern man isn't capable of understanding all of creation because our modern brains can't handle it.They also mention that:--Bigfoot creatures can teleport a few miles at a time. --We used to be able to go to the moon in four hours, Mars in two months, and had colonies in orbit.--Black people are an evolution of another, extremely similar homo species.--People during the first period of civilization didn't dream as they had access to the dreamscape at any time and basically walked around in a half dream state.--During the time of man, North America had a bird with a nearly 100' wing span (keeping in mind the largest we know of was closer to 25', with the largest pterodactyl at about 35').It got more and more ridiculous as it went on but *boy* was it all entertaining, I have to give them that. Also, whoever is behind it seems to be very well educated. They speak enough proven 'truth' that it's easy to go along with them for the ride.What questions did you ask? I truly wish I'd been there, I have a few of my own I'd love to ask! If even ten percent of what OP said was true, then it's still completely earth shattering info. Again, it's more fun to believe than to just flat out refuse to even entertain any of it. 

Because it rewrites human history. Religions would be uprooted, new tech would be available that would collapse the energy sector, and a big portion of academics would have to admit the lack of  knowledge. How do you think people would react if it came out that previous humans existed, were space fairers, and had tech beyond our imagination? 

> The medical companies don‚Äôt want it known because it would reduce their income? Fuck no. They would be selling these crystals or whatever at vast amounts of money in a second.Not if it cured diseases.  Medical companies have no interest in curing anything.  Their entire business model is built around treatment, not curing.  If you cure someone you lose a customer.

Their power comes from them having access to this tech while the rest of us stay happy with our outdated tech that they still get rich from.

>Have you heard any scuttlebut that Godlike Productions is a CIA honeypot or something?Your giving the CIA too much credit.Corruption, Treason, Black operations involving machinery far more advanced than we currently perceive, data collection, mechanisms of control like media, sports, and music, etc.They aren't running fake websites, they are busy doing something much more illegal and profitable. 

Ya figures as historical figures,  but when aboit the spirit realm of deities he says he won't answer those questions. I just find it odd. He must of seen something he just doesn't want to divulge. 

Neat! X/ is the Paranormal chan forum, which I normally don't waste my time on - but I found that gem there last night...Life's fucked like that... a lot of what Alterwelt said really clicked for me, especially with Ancient America. - so yeah, great post, universe must have some kind of use for the info in there :D

Do you happen to have links to the other threads you mentioned from the same OP? 

I was asking more along the lines of its readability 

It kind of is.  

Very interesting... thanks for that post!

The races are literally different.  Physiologically, psychologically, culturally, etc.Pointing out that those differences come with advantages and disadvantages is going to be absolutely necessary if we as humans ever want to create an equal society.Every time someone uses the word "racist" as an insult, they do damage to our future by creating a social stigma around incredibly important topics.We *need* to look at things with logic if we are to grow.

I've found a lot of the pre human history stuff interesting, I did get a book about the Akunani (spelling?) But as I read it it just came to me that this guy was talking out of his ass a lot of the time lol but interesting stuff.I'll look at your links when I get some time later todayThanks

That author (Charles Johnston) wrote a tonne of interesting articles. See [here]( http://www.universaltheosophy.com/writings-johnston/).

i heard there was added time so it messed it up(culturallayer)

I don't think you theory is far fetched at all, was just wondering if it could have a similar affect.I like your theory.

Many cultures built pyramids. That doesn‚Äôt mean they had ties to Egypt or they share something in common. The pyramids are very different in design, function and how they were built. Their languages are not similar nor dress nor funeral rights nor clothing nor genetics. They just don‚Äôt have anything that shows a common lineage or cultural migration. 

But how do we know that polarians ever existed?

I believe there's more than one, I watched a video tour of the museum they recently opened to the public 

They‚Äôre gonna need to account for a few million more years in there too

New chronology is transparent bullshit pseudoscience.

This is AMAZING 

‚ÄúThe Dark Ages‚Äù is actually pretty well known and isn‚Äôt lacking in sources like was originally thought when the term was coined in the 1330s. A freshman history student understands this...Your thought that nothing occurred then is still the lay persons thought but it‚Äôs far from the truth.

check out "the spectral time hypothesis" by some german dude. With his theory right now we have ~1730

That is a Victorian-era myth. 

This has nothing to do with aquifers or concrete, those are completely different technologies that have nothing to do with the discusson at hand, so what's your point? That's like saying self driving cars aren't 21st century technology because people had boats thousands of years ago; it makes zero sense because the two aren't related.I also don't understand what you could possibly find vague about 1300s technology; we're discussing one, single piece of technology,  not 1300s technology in general. The specific technology in question is the ability to manufacture a device capable of predicting astronomical events decades in advance(also tracking calendar, 4 year olympics cycle, irregular orbit of the moon, etc) without the need to do the math by hand, which other than the device is not seen until the 1300s.I also think you're confused about what the term computer means in a non-modern context since you keep insisting that a bunch of gears isn't necessarily a computer, even though we know exactly what function it was built for (COMPUTING predictive astronomical problems). The device was used to solve (compute) predictive astronomical problems without needing to do the math by hand. What about the device doesn't seem like a computer to you? >analogue computer¬†is a form of¬†computer¬†that uses the continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as¬†electrical,¬†**mechanical** *^(gears in this case)*, or¬†hydraulic¬†quantities to¬†model¬†the **problem being solved** *^(predictions of astronomical events decades in advance)*.

> the technology is on par with the timeWait a moment. I agree that there's nothing suspicious here. But what is usually reported is that \*before\* the Antikythera mechanism was found there was nothing remotely similar to its complexity, and nothing remotely similar to the degree of precision and craftemenship required to build it. If it hadn't been dated precisely it surely would have been considered an hoax. But now we know we had the skills to build something like this long ago, case closed. I don't see any mystery myself but to deny the sheer magnitude of this finding is useless.

That doesn't even come close to the complexity of the Antikythera mechanism. >Meaning... the technology is on par with the time.That was sort of the point. The mechanical complexity predates what is traditionally thought of on par with devices from the 1300's, but stands as an example that it predates that period by about 13-15 hundreds years.

Lolol, you're way too butthurt over this thread bruh. By your logic a modern computer isn't a computer because humans designed it. Also, it doesn't matter thats its manually powered: If I power my computer with a stationary bike it is still a computer. 

> Please explain how manual gears predict astrological events?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_computerYou mean "*astronomical* events', right?

Lol. The very act of trying to follow the movements of celestial bodies, which would include positioning that would cause eclipses, is a prediction. Prediction is another word for attempting to guess the future. When the weatherman says on Tuesday that it'll rain Thursday he is making a prediction. When you say the planets will be in this alignment tomorrow night that is a prediction. If you still disagree, you can forget the semantics of prediction and just realize it is computing the movements. The astronomical knowledge inputted wasn't new. The calculations weren't new. But this tool designed to do the calculations using those inputs was new and is an early, simple example of an analog computing device aka a computer. 

no one has ever said anything about Youtube. also his argument is less about the gizmo in question and more about your ignorance as to what a computer actually is. 

Did I say anything refuting computation?  No.  Way to argue with yourself though lol...

I'd watch it

 

Plague riddled Church?I know! Let's build a water reservoir with it in the middle of it! 

Sorry everyone who was shouting for a link - got busy with my day and forgot.  

 

I have never thought about what's beneath the sand. There could be a whole civilization. Imagine the artifacts and history underneath our feet 

LAcumDodgers to the rescue.All jokes aside, this is something I had not pondered before, but is perfect speculation to present to someone if you want to keep them thinking. Awesome question.

This comment was fantastic in that you ended up distracting from the original conversation more than a stupid fucking joke, as that was what it was, just a stupid joke mate. Anyhow in a way it was good because it seemed to have spawned some decent discusion on the nature of memes. Cheers to that.

Memes don‚Äôt detract from anything. It‚Äôs your own fault for not seeking out information. 

> there are some pretty big structures under water in japan. clearly there was some big cities that are no longer with us.Do you have some links? I'd love to learn more about ancient underwater Japanese cities.

Plenty of cultures have those stories, those are the great flood mythologies. Noah and the dozens of other legends from all around the world. Problem is writing was not a thing so thousands of years of telephone turned "sea levels rose wiped out our city" into "BUILD AN ARK 40 CUBITS!"

You don't know how melting ice works?

 

Nope, not at all, carbon dating is pretty rock soild "pun intended" science. There are also a ton of other chemcial dating techniqes. light speed is also a soildly understood science so we understand how old the universe can be. There is absolutely zero chance of human history being 6000 years old or whatever creationism believes. There is a chance we find older remains, we have found some rather interesting ones lately as well as ruins that predate current models of human history. 

I've always thought about that. I looked it up last night and found that the ocean has risen 120 meters since the last ice age. I can't link from my phone right now, but I found a map after googling something like "ocean 120 meters lower" and it brought up an old Reddit post with a map of the earth minus 120 meters of ocean. I focused on the area around northern Australia/Indonesia/New Guinea. If you take a look at that map, Australia is connected to New Guinea 12,800 years ago. The sea of Arafura was above sea level. There was a huge land mass from southeast Asia which almost connected to the mainland of Australia. Today it is a string of islands and countries from Malaysia to Indonesia.I theorize that there was an advanced civilization which built the massive pyramid currently being excavated at Gunung Padang in Indonesia. What are now island countries were the mountainous highlands of that time, while all the coastal habitations are now under 120 meters of water west of Sumatra and north of Indonesia. EDIT: [Here is the map of the earth with sea levels 120 meters lower](https://openseadragon.github.io/openseadragonizer/?img=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redditmedia.com%2F7IrIc4GkQtEnU8U6g-jYswJtnJUXOsij_Lk-1ZBkH-c.jpg%3Fs%3D2d7e73b69a68e2c3f1cb422493e4f7d2&encoded=true)

On page 18 he admits he was lying

I think if anything it's more along the lines of TPTB staying in power. No way they can lose their power when they have technology we cant even begin to understand. If we make it far enough, some day people are gonna look back on the government hiding this issue like we look at Galeileo getting imprisoned for saying the earth revolves around the sun.

I'm not a cynical about the medical industry, but you are mostly right.If it was some sort of crystal you'd need to constantly rebuy, sure!But what if you just rub it once and bye bye Alzheimer's? There's literally no direct profit there except maybe a one time rubbing fee. 

I am inclined to disagree on this one. There are a lotta cubicle farms in Langely. I'm absolutely certain that the CIA does not deem such an initiative below its purview. It seems to me that the CIA has and continues to dabble in its fair share of either bankrolling or outright creating propaganda, social engineering initiatives, and limited hangouts not only on its own citizens, but throughout the planet.Hypothetically, were I in charge of the most disgusting organized crime syndicate on the planet, I'd be more than happy to scrap together a purposefully low-gloss "authentic" hang-out and/or forum targeting curious awakening souls in order to:1. Monitor what awakening people say or are curious about.2. Control the dribble of juicy details about real elements of the consciousness hologram we're all logged into, or at the very least contextualize them in a way that maintains the CIA's control or perch.3. Keep curious yet powerful minds occupied so that the organization's rape and pillage of the planet and its surface population could continue in perpetuity.

From what I've heard, it's run by tavistock. Not to mention my phone didn't want me to spell that and if you say it on GLP, you get instantly banned.

He says Jesus was as close to God as he said he was, but he was the "transcended" and knew what the higher civilizations knew. It also said Jesus was against organized religion. The OP talks about other spiritual figures like Buddha who knew the same things, just not to the same degree as Jesus.He says consciousness is real and never really ends. As opposed to the previous humans, we made life and death finite and our subconscious is our dream state. He said we can't comprehend what the higher humans thought or operated like because their brains were always subconsciously awake and similar to a lucid dream state. Some far out shit

I started a new post to keep everything organized. It includes all three Alterwelt threads, as well as another GLP thread from someone that seems to be Alterwelt, or someone from his group.https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8brzls/remote_viewing_of_ancient_civilizations/

I'm not at my computer right now, but ill try to get them together for you when I can

It's definitely readable, not as dry as some other works by academics can be. If your interested in the topic you'll melt through the book. 

 

http://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/D-S-Allan/410052717There you go. Cambridge educated, science historian and teacher for years. That credible enough for you? While I understand your perspective, if you're waiting for a professor from a modern university to argue against the established history narrative you're going to be waiting a long time. 

Yes! I strongly wish more people understood this. Society seems to be stuck in an older framework of understanding the races, where too much is considered taboo and real discussion can't occur when most people are either overly sensitive or worried about offending someone. There is no way truly forward from this point, only more of the same, just like the powers that be want it. They love to see us divided and hating each other.. it keeps us from focusing our discontent where it really belongs. If we could all come together, unite our visions and find true strength in numbers and new purpose, we would be unstoppable. 

Not even of they have similar uses, similar art work, similar architecture

No idea. Though the idea that life began at the poles does make a certain amount of sense to me.Tbh I'd say anyone claiming they can *prove* or *know* much of anything about humanity prior to about 12,000 years ago is likely far over reaching. It's a sad state of affairs that we know so little, but we can speculate and try to put puzzle pieces together. May be that we'll never know for sure. 

A friend just randomly shared [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03748) with me, so thought I'd pass it on. It's a scientific paper examining the question of if and how we might discover evidence of industrial civilizations on Earth in our remote past. And here's a [summary "layman's" article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/are-we-earths-only-civilization/557180/) about it.

So you're saying you don't have a strong opinion of it?

Yep we have sources for many things in that time period and the world politics of the time usually align with why you would have increase or decrease of sources or literacy.  This theory is definitely going a bit far.  However some scientific papers on the solar patters and time scale would be interesting to read, but the link I followed had nothing and the thread did not have any legitimate sources or studies.   ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

Please google the south pointing chariot... it predates it by a minimim of 1200 yrs and does the same thing... well, does more Edit: and as ive said steam and gear driven timepieces and even hydraulic were around for a millennia before this. Im done in this topic tho, too deep, no interest in arguing with people citing youtube vids... beyond stupidEdit as well: changrd facing to pointing. My bad

Okay weve reached a dead end i guess. Ty for your effort. For the record... it is incredibly more complex, it tracked time, direction as well as distance, i guess... time is tougher, especially 1400 (2600 by your estimate) years later?... not according to the youtube hysteria around this object. I sware youtube conspiracy videos are a conspiracy to discredit conspiracys... so much kool aid.

No, just disappointed, very disappointed in modern skeptics on reddit (/conspiracy) self destruct logic. I.e. a lot of people here, say i argue 1/8 based on representation of responses actually looked up this object with an emphasis on peer reviewed data, it is important not only what but where scientific/historical claims are made. If i say something, and have even the ability to censor discourse, i should be taken less seriously than if i say something encouraging others to disagree, tear down a statement and together build a better one... so ALL peer reviewed data on this object says a few things, and everyone (7/8) is apparently disagreeing with their findings. And that is disappointing, and not really worth the time after a point (which ive passed idk why im here... day off maybe to blamd, i should go buy a wii u and mario maker 1.5 yrs late, lol). Anyways... this then gets into the territory of not understanding how gears work. Otherwise youd have acknowledged by this logic a wheel with a marker on it is a computer. The source of power isnt the point, the point is because it is a time device the start time affects ability for a set of gears (just think bicycle with mark om wheel). If you can find all the missing pieces, and then run a few trials where you predict an astrological event despite start time, ill concede. Until then, this is silly. Take care friend. :)

They made claims earlier in thread about predicting astrological events. Thats root of my kool aid youtube nonsense... as thats only place its found. Maybe there is also some confusion around the device in their minds capabilities vs the device actual known capabilities... which for the last fucking time is theorized to be an astrological/celestial timepiece... which means it isnt computing anything. If you think it predicts astrological events... then to you its a computer. Of youre going off peer reviewed actual data on the damn thing, its not computing anything, the builder did the computing with gear ratios... im so done in this thread though. Take care. Believe whatever the fuck you want. 

It.. It's not a movie.

that is pretty cool. I saw this thing on the discovery channel when I was a kid about some desert shrubs in Africa that can go a long time without water and then there was a dust storm that buried one of these shrubs under like 120foot sand dune in a day or two. if that much sand can dune up on a friggin shrub then the terrain can change dramatically in a few generations. if I remember correctly didn't they have to excavate some of the pyramids because they were literally buried in sand? who knows what else in under all that sand. 

Something similar happened in Bulgaria, East Europe.They have a town called Nessebar, that was sacked by the Turks and was a focal point of many wars between Bulgaria and Turkey.This town is split into old and new Nessebar but they inhabit the same 'island'. I can't remember what the proper term is, but it's one of those towns that is (well, was, they built a higher road a few years ago) only accessible when the tide is out.A few years ago they were doing some renovation in the town centre when they uncovered ancient roman ruins(or ruins of the same time period) When you walk through the town, the tops of the ruins are only a few feet below street level and they have uncovered some amazing architecture.So, I suppose it goes to show that ruins could be lost through various wars or just buried totally for whatever random reason shit ends up below the ground. More importantly, it shows that even in a busy town with a long history, secrets remain hidden just under the surface.Who knows what we would find in mid Africa or Greece or Italy or...

Thanks!

Can you send me link?

Nice response 2 weeks after the conversation ended lol

Haha. Yes, they do detract when they are solely about being a pointless silly meme joke and that's all they add. And don't you worry bud, I *do* seek out information. Thanks for assuming. I already have researched the topic at hand. I wanted to hear his thoughts. Unfortunately, for people who haven't, they get 0 information at all. Convo over. These shit memes just stop the conversation, instead of promote it. That's why this is frustrating. I know I will research this topic more, but shitty memes will probably discourage some others from looking into the topic. Kind of the opposite view of /r/conspiracy, no? Fuck me for wanting people to actually discuss things at hand instead of switching the conversation to flavor of the hour level bullshit?But yeah, defend the shit joke and subreddit, and pretend like those low effort garbage memes from /r/prequelmemes don't stop and limit conversation. But thanks for showing that you would rather stand up for a fad joke subreddit...really shows your character. Or lack thereof

There are a few websites that talk about them the wiki page I think calls it a ‚Äúgeological formation‚Äù but [one look](http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-oceania/mysterious-10000-year-old-underwater-ruins-japan-00817) and it‚Äôs clear they are not naturally formed.

Where is the empirical evidence of sea level rises?

That will definitely stir the pot a bit, also really excited we learn more about Gobeki Temple

> There is absolutely zero chance of human history being 6000 years old or whatever creationism believes. Just going for 'Devils advocate here' (Because I am bored and at work and always interested in others minds) (NOTE: I am NOT a creationist):Regarding that comment, often carbon dating and the dating of the rock around it are used as proof against creationism, however... wouldnt an all powerful being be able to fake those results? place them in an already deteriorated state? Like how they believe the dino bones were put there by lucifer to test our faith (or whatever)

> carbon dating is pretty rock soild "pun intended" scienceWhat leads you to believe this?> light speed is also a soildly understood science so we understand how old the universe can be. What does 'light speed' have to do with anything?> There is absolutely zero chance of human history being 6000 years old or whatever creationism believes. Who said anything about 'creationism'? What does that even mean?

Yeah so basically Oceania would be one big continent. I was reading something about the coral reefs and how there finding massive reefs at depths of up to 1500ft but coral reefs are only formed around 150ft so it proves the ocean floors go up and down which could be an explanation for Atlantis and Lemuria disappearing in stages. So in other words they think these lost cities are under the coral reefs and that explains why we havnt found anything because the reefs are a protected ecosystem. 

I'm on mobile, could you link it? 

please do, thank you!

It just lends to credibility. People who have in depth research that would be Earth shattering if true, tend to be close to a doctorate. 

They should make a Mel Brooks style musical covering the major points. That would be hilarious!

- I'm not the persone you were talking to.- It actually says the first documented south-pointing chariot was built 500 hundreds after the Antikythera mechanism.- It's just a chariot with two differential gears, not a tool the size of a book with 80 gears, and it has been built by carpenters for centuries, while tools that required the craftmanship of the Antikythera mechanism couldn't be built until 1400 CE. So I don't know what you are talking about, if you believe the Antikythera mechanism is anything less than an extraordinary finding I won't even try to convince you.

Please update the wiki article then with sources that confirms your stance about it being unremarkable and an average work for the period and I will stop sharing it. I have never seen a youtube video about this thing actually, I found it linked in a lame list article like a decade ago and it stuck in my head as interesting. I am certain it should be easy work considering how obvious it seems to you. 

It also tracked the Olympic dates. There is a very cool youtube series about a guy making a replica using a lot of tools of the time. Check out clickspring. He later uses modern tech to speed up the process.

You are spot on with your last sentence. 

Im going to be honest; 90% of your post makes no sense to me but I'll say these few things. 1. Idk where your getting this YouTube vs peer review thing. I haven't watched 1 YT video on this thing and in my googling, all the peer reviewed articles I came across concluded it's a complex and fairly accurate astronomical model of the celestial bodies known at that time. 2. You dont ever present any case other that "peer review says" and "people dont understand gears." Neither of which are an actual argument. 3. A wheel with markings wouldn't be an analog computer by itself. It needs to interact with other computational elements. A slide rule is an analog computer though. Basically just a couple marked sticks you slide past each other. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_computer 

Oh so its not released yet? Where can I watch the first one?

the huge swathes of desert today (such as the sahara or gobi) was supposedly created by an ancient global war by some theories..so perhaps if we dig we might find some ruins

 

Yep, thanks. Been busy.

Hey, I'm a few days late to this thread but I wanted to say that I agree with you 100% about memes interrupting the flow of conversation and distracting from the topic at hand. It irritates the shit out of me too. Reddit used to have a much more intelligent/mature userbase, before it blew up and got as popular as Facebook. I would come here to learn, stretch my brain, and be frequently blown away by the discussions. You can still find that in certain subs, this being one.. don't get me wrong, I enjoy some memes and pun threads as much as anyone, but there's a time and place for everything. 

It‚Äôs not that serious.

Lmao your bitching is doing the exact thing you hate. Go away. 

You can track the old shoreline by looking at the sediment layers offshore 

He stated that the local people used it as an administrative center.  He goes on to share that the ancient people had a chemical paste for softening stone that would make it like clay.He said those people are descendents of humanity's second fall from greatness.   Their technology remained in small circles but wasn't really understood.  Over time the relics were lost.   It's a wild read and hard to put down once you start reading.   I do think it's some kind of soft disclosure however.  The person dropping the info really gives less and less info as you go on it seems.   In the beginning he tells about how we're all being held in a state of lower technology on purpose to benefit those in power and prevent upheaval. Towards the end he seems to hush those kinds of details to an extent. 

Because I've read up quite a bit on it, and 100s of thousands of people have done this kind of stuff on a regular basis, there is no conspiracy, carbon dating is soild science.Light speed has to do with we know the universe is billions of years old and unimaginably large, giving plenty of time for a long history of life and most likely common in the universe.Because creationism is the largest group of people that believe human history is very short, and sadly use a lot of flawed science to push their idea.

So your opinion that "science doesn't feel right, man" supercedes all of the collaborative effort of scientists? Just making sure we are on the same page here.

That is very interesting. I never knew that about coral reefs. I also believe that 13,000 years of soil is probably making it hard to find as well. Check out Gunung Padang. There is a megalithic site on top of the "hill" in west java, but that hill is apparently man-made. The excavation is still underway, but there appears to be a massive pyramid under the hill. Core samples are saying that the pyramid is 20,000 years old. 

Nowhere on page 18 does Alterwelt admit to lying about anything.https://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2702754/pg18

http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2702754/pg118?regp=bm9fMTUyMzU5ODc3NA==

That‚Äôs the very description of the logical fallacy of argument of authority.   There‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs a fallacy. 

I wish we could get more Mel Brooks movies. Could you imagine if he tried to release Blazing Saddles now?

Its extraordinary, just not ancient lost civilization or technology extraordinary. Also... got sources? I just doublechecked and they have around 1200 yr difference in line with what ive said like 5x here already. Please dont link me to youtube... :)Edit: and hypothesized 37 gears still doesnt mean theyve found more than bits of 2...

Sad reality is peer reviewed data on this says it ia very much open to interpretation and likely a mariner centric timepiece, an astrological clock. Just because youtubers profoundly hypothesize bullshit doesnt make it so. Also, dont cite wikipedia... outnumbering people doesnt make you right. It makes you a mob.Edit: ive passed my 2 response per limit topic here. I do this because theres no point arguing with someone citing youtube vids with agendas... i have no interest in circling the drain with you. 

1. As ive said many times this is the only place you see the claim predicting astrological events occur. I think maybe this post has branched more than 2 response trees. Claim is in both.2. Mobile, cant link well. Sorry cant do any better excuse is honesty. I have mentioned adding peer review or .edu to any google queries on topic. And i have implored people to seek peer reviewed comparisons. But im refuting claims anyways, burden of proof is on claimant citing hearsay.3. Youre right, it isnt a computer, it contains none of the parts that would differentiate computing. Gears and housing alone powered by man dont compute astrological events. Ty thats very helpful here :) More lost time and karma yippeeeee. Youd love my take on dyatlov pass :*

When you can find it. Good luck searching the entire Rub' al Khali desert.

Who‚Äôs theories are those? I‚Äôd love to hear more.

I need a source for that one, sounds interesting.

Thanks!

Well, that's just, like your opinion man.See I can make meme jokes too.But really, a lot of people care. That's why my comment got upvoted. This is one of the only places I would expect reddit to care. This place is supposed to be about free, open discussion...and when a control mechanism is used to limit conversation right in front of us, I would expect some people to be irratated. It doesn't matter if it was on accident, it stopped the conversation pretty effectively. If you look at those jokes on reddit you will find the same trend in every thread...it stops the original topic in place. So even if its just in fun, it's kind of messing with the whole point of /r/conspiracy.You know memes and memetics have value and are real right? For a long time I might add. The Navy has done research on them, as well as many respected people over time. It's not coincedence that memes have become popular in the last decade or so.That's what /r/prequelmemes has been doing, even if its just a joke and on accident. That's why it's gaining in popularity and it stops conversations everywhere it happens. That's the meme magic of /r/prequelmemesBut yeah.....not a big deal

Where?

Very interesting, I feel the truth is most likely between that and what is written in text books, I personally am really tired of this whole pyramids are tombs bullshit they spew out since almost none of them ever even had evidence of someone burried in them.Also I find it odd that the newer ones seem to be less awesome, we lost technology from 2800BC from making Giza to 1800BC making them out of mud bricks 

Don't waste your time. Unless you want to be explaining the results of science and physics in the last 400 years, history that he regards as having been all faked by evil smart people, so resourceful that they faked the life achievements of the worlds most brilliant minds! 

> 100s of thousands of peoplelol, do you really believe this?

Strawmen are for stupid people. Please rise above the juvenile nonsense.I am asking for **empirical evidence** to support the claims being made.

will do and give this a watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swe3EOKCbFI

Its on page 118 actually http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2702754/pg118?regp=bm9fMTUyMzU5ODc3NA==

I said it lends to credibility, I didny say it was the basis of an argument. 

It honestly makes me sad to think that movies of that calibre just can‚Äôt be released these days for fear of major backlash. But then I just watch Blazing Saddles again and feel better that at least there was a time hat they could be made. 

No one has linked any YouTube videos. Why do you keep bringing "YouTube videos with an agenda" when no one has linked any? 

I just looked the wikipedia page which I though was what you wanted. And it says "*the first reliably documented one was created by the Chinese mechanical engineer Ma Jun (c. 200‚Äì265 CE) of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms*". And in any case is just a chariot, I'm sure there are other inventions that are far superior to this chariot and still have not surprised researchers as much as the Antikythera mechanism. And if you think they have found only bits of two gears maybe it's the reason why you don't see how extraordinary was this tool. Then again I repeat, I'm not the guy you were talking before, I agree with you that it has nothing to do with ancient civilizations, never mind Atlantis. But still it changes our view about what we were able to craft at that time. By a long shot.

the person you are arguing with claims they are not siting youtube videos and they never mentioned a youtube video. 

I‚Äôve totally observed this situation countless times in threads on this sub without ever thinking of it like that. Jokes do completely ruin or hinder the flow of topics of conversation online.  My question might have been that short to warrant the sarcastic response but it was still a real question looking for answers. Makes me wonder how much is lost when this happens. 

And thats why I miss Slashdot‚Äôs moderation system.

An innocuous statement in a thread does not limit conversation. It doesn‚Äôt stop others from adding to the dialogue. 

I think the weird part here is that you seem to be immediately hopping to the defence against global warming, while missing the point that the discussion is about sea levels hundreds of thousands of years ago, if not millions. Do you think the grand canyon came out of nowhere? Do you think the great lakes were always there? This understanding of changing geography and landscape has been known and accepted for a long time. Hell, this is grade 9 geography.

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

"Yes all faked so they can.... Ummmm.... Be evil!!"Yeah I know the types, it's like flat earthers, can't even get a straight answer on why anyone would go through the trouble to lie about something like that lol

Yeah, they do it in freaking college labs and classes all over the world for nearly 100 years now. A low estimate would say 1-2k people do a hands on learning for it at least once a year. It isn't super secret shit, you can pay like $500 to have anything carbon dated to most Universities.... The only really difficult part is you need a clean room and be smart about contamination. Easy peasy....Anyone could spend about 15 grand to setup everything you need to do basic carbon dating yourself in a small room and prove its wrong, which you will just prove it's right.

So the peer reviewed "carbon dating" and "speed of light" don't meet your high standards of science like " they are lying to us man". Gotcha.

Thanks for the clarification. Allegedly it's not just a person, but a group of people answering through the Alterwelt account. On page 127 Alterwelt comes back and claims part of their group tried to end the thread but it wasn't agreed upon. He(they) start answering questions again.http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2702754/pg127

Fair enough, I feel similarly in many cases. Just have to be careful not to dismiss good work because it wasn‚Äôt produced by a prestigious professor. 

I wonder that same thing. that guy just has this super smug nopyness to his comments. he has this attitude like he should know what is and isn't a computer he was making computers out of sane and turtle shells before the pyramids existed.

They keep mentioning youtube videos as well, and no one has even linked one about this.I was never making some claim about this being some proof of a lost prehistory, but more along the lines of it changes our understanding of the sophistication of the tech available during known history.But I guess I and everyone else is crazy about this topic because "youtube videos". ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Theyre citing (its citing btw... citation) things only found in youtube vids and shit conspiracy pandering blogs... when i see 'predict astrological events' i know what im dealing with here. Thats stupid, you can just look at it and know theres literally no way to reverse engineer that info. Or that that is information gears can provide... yeah its stupid. Thats kool aid nonsense and also when i realize theres little point continuing talk. 

ok it has been a while now. scroll back in this conversation and see if there is any flow left from the original comment/question "you ever wonder whats under all that sand?"to me it looks like no one wants to talk about it anymore and even I am here commenting on the state of the memeing and joking derailing the topic. jokes aside lets have a serious discussion for a change. 

> This understanding of changing geography and landscape has been known and accepted for a long time. Hell, this is grade 9 geography.You believe school exists to make you wise?

> A low estimate would say 1-2k people do a hands on learning for it at least once a year.'Hands-on learning' of what? Carbon dating? 

Reading papers counts as 'hands on' now? lol. Too easy.

I didn't see anyone correcting your obvious grammatical mistakes in not 1 but 2 of your previous posts....but I digress, you sound like a pompous douche who keeps making up straw man arguments about only things that YOU mention.

It's like all the top comments in threads about Zuckerberg quickly devolving into meme circlejerks.

School exists to teach you how to learn. They taught me how to research and understand. And I have done so, often outside of their norms. And even so, I see you have decided to ignore my main point to try and shift the argument towards what you believe to be the weak point: me talking about rising sea levels in the past.Do you have any comments on that? 

Yes, so when people say carbon dating is fake, or a lie I call bullshit because you would have to get 100k plus people to keep the lie up.https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/geology-rankingsHere is a short list of the top schools with geology masters programs in the US. That list would mean there are about 300-500+ people in the US alone every year getting in-depth and hands on training in carbon dating. It's not fake, it's not made up. It's soild and proven science.

What is your idea if empirical evidence? I'm honestly curious. Is the main factor that it agrees with you?Also, where did I say "hands on" Mr "that's a strawman"?

Nah, thread got split in 2 lines of reaponses. Conspiracy does bring out the douche... can only keep saying the same stuff, cant prove a negative. Every now and then its worthwhile, and people always worth the gamble... doesnt mean the gamble pays off. Keep up the quality content tho. And... typos =/= not knowing how to spell shit. Cya dummy. 

> School exists to teach you how to learn.lol. You must be young.

How does one do 'hands-on' learning of carbon dating?Or by 'hands-on', do you mean hands on a textbook, rote learning the same dogma as everybody else?

Glad to see you acknowledge how you act. That's the first step. Just a tip, aside from what nonsense you say you might want to proof-read what you post before you do. That way you might only look like an ass that doesn't know what your talking about. At least you'll be spelling it correctly.

Dodging again.

You take anything made of carbon, bone, wood, ect, you take it into a clean room, you place it into an airtight box, you drill a hole and take a peice that was not exposed to air, messure it's weight.You burn it while collecting the smoke that is then fed into an instrument that counts the particles, the ratio of C14 compared to C12 tells you it's age, as the C14 degrades into C12 at a specific rateI did a search, you can pay the grad students of a university in Florida to do this for you for under $500. It isn't complex, it's done all over universities every week. Sure if you are getting a BA in geology then it's msot likely text book work, but there are 100s in geology doctorial programs every semester across the states and I'm sure 1000s when you look at the whole globe.If it didn't work, someone would write a paper about it and it would be tested 100 fold because that happens all the time with scientific methods and research every day.

When i saw these Hampstead Children years ago when this video came out there were about 10 other videos that came out with it.  I remember clearly the kid saying they were "taken to pizza shops where people did sex on them." This was years before pizzagate happened.

Allow me to chip in with what will undoubtedly be seen as a provocative post.  Human sex trafficking is being blurred purposefully by the media.  On the one hand, there is the very real child trafficking from third world and war other torn countries, this trafficking is being carried out by organisations most people think are 'there to help '.However, the lines are being blurred by the adult trafficking, where, it is claimed the women thought they were getting jobs as cleaners or au pairs but were forced by wicked men into prostitution. These are almost always complete bullshit. Allow me to explain. I know of a couple who operated in Paris, they would go to cambodia, Vietnam and northern regions of thailand to recruit prostitutes. They would arrange visas, pay for flights and provide accommodation. The girls all knew they would be prostitutes, but told their parents that they had been offered real jobs in France.  This couple would provide all clients for the girls and until their debt had been paid they needed to pay 30% of their earnings to the couple.  Once the debt had been paid they just paid 10% of their earnings.  All of this is made clear to the girls. So, off they went to be prostitutes.  Even with the 30% deductions they would be making more money than they could ever hope to earn in their home countries.  Please remember these girls are whores, they were whores back home too.  One thing whores do better than anything is lie.  They lie to punters "you're so handsome", "i love a fat man", "i prefer older men" etc.  They lie to their friends and family "i work at the airport", "i have a rich boyfriend" etc.  Yet you all think that when the police raid their brothels they suddenly become bastions of truth? Think about it. They get raided and they have two choices,  tell the truth and be immediately imprisoned, have all their belongings confiscated and await deportation.  Or,  say they thought they were going to be a cleaner but the evil men forced them to be whores. This story will get them immediately put on a working visa, authorities will try to get them proper jobs,  pay for their education and give them full welfare rights.  No surprises for guessing theyll claim to have been trafficked. Just go on holiday to Thailand. Go to any border control and look at the queues of young girls all waiting to get in.  You can see the girls who are wanting to get in to become whores, and there are thousands of them.  Often travelling alone or with just one other friend.  There is an over abundance of girls willing to be whores. The same is true of eastern europe, they are awash with prostitutes. Why would you need to force anyone to do something that an over supply of people are willing to do?  You wouldn't! These adults who claim to have been trafficked are being used as a smokescreen for the real trafficking that is going on.  Almost all the busts are dealing with adults, not kids.

**Deconstructing the ‚Äúdominoes on cheese/pasta phrase using the Podesta emails:**‚ÄîSo the *dominoes on cheese than on pasta* phrase is frequently cited as if it‚Äôs an example of some pedo code.

Which it is. **They were vacation buddies on Martha‚Äôs Vineyard who would play dominoes together, hence the reference to playing dominoes.

Holy shit, barely two hours old and everything is being downvoted.  This honestly just leads more credence to the idea that there are groups specifically targetting pizzagate threads, never seen anywhere close to this many downvotes in other round tables

I'm just surprised the actress from the show Smallville is being charged for exactly what the post is trying to talk about.

There will be dismissals and controversy in this topic. Expect red herring political smokescreens with partisan lies and ridicule. Go beyond. Pizza toppings are just theories. Be more selective with your conspiracy here people. The monsters don't want to be found and a real story lurks in the networks beneath. For the deniers, lets start with the undeniable monsters. Jimmy Saville. Mark Dutroux. Shocking and disturbing. The facts are chilling. But isn't it strange how brazen, boastful and connected they were?Whilst they imply Royal associations the tentacles go beyond elite Hapsburg bloodlines. The Michael Aquino cases involved military cover-ups. The Franklin Affair was neutered by judges. The Finders torn apart by the media. The point is that establishment rings are the usual suspects for this conspiracy. So it may be more relevant to ask why than ask who.. So why?Is it a recipe for Disassociative Identity Disorder? Some macabre twist from MK-Ultra programs to condition the most appalling human programming? Or is it less weaponised and more trade related? Consider how sheiks are sweetened with bacha bazi dancing boys and there is a pattern in Middle East oil negotiations. Is this some commoditised trade network to do blind eye despot deals on the resource chessboard? It plausible if you consider the main pizza references emerged after unforeseen leaks of state dept emails after Hilary's email server got gang hacked by spooks. But then why would so many priests get caught in this controversy? Is there is also some extreme sociopath behaviour that is more prone to corrupt inside these individuals? Or perhaps there is something more sinister and organised in society? Something that penetrates all power institutions? If so what the fuck is that?

Can we start by delineating pizzagate and elite child abuse?There's no indication in the Podesta emails of child abuse.

Edit: see child commentsTrump's campaign chair was charged with trafficking of a minor. Arrested in Nov '17 I believe. Not a word from msm on either side. Reuters was the only big source I've seen.But we all know about those two scoops!

Lumping Pizzagate with Pedogate is a disservice to real crimes.

Question for the pizzagate naysayers: Why has no one ever asked John Podesta to simply explain the pizza code in the emails?You'd think a man accused of what he is accused of would at the very least be asked to explain his side of the story, or even address it himself. But this has not happened \- why do you think this is?

People act like pizzagate is some republican plan to conspire against Hillary, why can't people just look at the facts?  It's a fact that the Clinton's been associated with some unsavory people over the years, in particular their closest friends and buisiness partners.  Hillary & Bill cofounded the Clinton Foundation with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein; HRC's closest aide Huma Abedin's husband Anthony Weiner was convicted of sexting a minor; and of course Weinstein who everyone knows about now (and John and Tony Podesta are lesser known examples too).  **How many of your friends or business partners are convicted pedophiles or serial rapists, and why hasn't Hillary denounced them yet?**

Who would've thought this thread would end up like this so soon?

Good stuff posted here; thanks everybody. Three good forums for researching and discussing this topic:- /r/pedogate -- full disclosure, I'm a mod- /r/satanicritualabuse -- warning, this gets very dark, but that's exactly why it needs more exposure- https://voat.co/v/pizzagate -- probably the best source for original research

This thread is going to be interesting to watch!Nonetheless politics aside, one thing I never see discussed is psychology behind why elites engage in pedophilia. Personally I have my own theory. I read in article years ago that one way chimps display dominance is stealing the baby from the mother chimp and then eating it in front of them (the article below describes such behavior). Seeing as how humans are related to chimps, I believe this is why the elites engage in pedophilia and other sexual assault. See it‚Äôs one thing to be able to dominant and exploit a person. It‚Äôs an entirely different level of power and evil to be able to exploit someone‚Äôs children and for them to be powerless to stop it.http://www.newsweek.com/cannibal-chimp-snatches-newborn-eats-it-shocking-behavior-maternity-leave-686873

Lol at the shill brigade. The evidence for pizzagate is overwhelming and those pedos will be brought to justice if not in this life than the next.

I have put this thread in contest mode due to the high volume of troll traffic. Read deep, think for yourselves. Votes only tell you what others think.

What‚Äôs contest mode? 

James is clearly guilty of something.If  he wasn't, why would he have threatened a voat Pizzagate researcher  with killing his entire family and "suing his dead body" if he didn't  remove one of his posts exposing a property of Alefantis' as a potential  trafficking hub, the "Pegasus Museum"?[https://youtu.be/qBn7ja\_oegM](https://youtu.be/qBn7ja_oegM)Heres an SS of the threatened guy's Police report.[https://m.imgur.com/a/PiLKE](https://m.imgur.com/a/PiLKE)

When discussing pizzagate (and the passage of time) it's become VERY easy to disengage with shills. Detractors will say common things ranging from the simple "pizzagate isn't real you (deragatory term typically insulting intelligence)" to "OMG you think Hillary Clinton raped kids in a pizza basement?" (Obvious super exaggeration) Oh and don't forget the "crazed armed gunman who almost killed someone" while neglecting to mention that the cameras facing the parlor we're turned for only that one day and that the one bullet fired was hitting the computer tower

Just watched the joe Rohan Alex jones podcast, they go into detail on pizza gate and other crazy elitist globalist conspiracy‚Äôs that are proven. really opens your eyes 

I tried to explain this to someone the other day They weren't running kids out of comet ping pong that was disinfo to conceal the truth, that comet ping pong was like the Cheers for high powered DC pedo's.

Why not go a little bit back in time and talk about THE WACO MASACRE all because David Koresh and Co. hacked into the CIA and found out about the sex trafficking that was taking place between the US Goverment with collaboration of the Buffalo Airlines?

This is so nuts!  These threads STILL are always swarmed with bullshit

The disruptors appear to have moved on from this thread so it's been restored from contest mode.Happy speculating!

Hey, we did it, this is the round table I've been waiting for. I'll look up more stuff later.

Testing my comments as I'm over the 2 month mark.

Great topic! Well done axol.

In the response to the new Qposts. Especially: #FutureProvesPast #TrustNoOne I think people need to start looking at the connections with Jones, Stone, and Megyn Kelly. Joe Biggs left Infowars after he was covering the weird emails from Podesta involving pedo language. Then Alex went on and on about a False Flag and blaming him/Infowars. Well what do you know. It happened, exactly like he said. It was like he had "good intel" or he "knows the Globalist". Because some dude shot a computer in Ping Pong Pizza parlor and it was blamed on infowars. Then Megyn Kelly did an interview with the owner of Ping Pong Pizza to discredit Infowars when she was still on Fox. Then the lawsuit emerged from the owner of Ping Pong Pizza and Alex made an official statement about it being fake. It was no longer discussed. Then there was the epic Megyn Kelly interview where it was a supposed "hit job" on Alex. He recorded her and posted. Blah blah blah. Then when you go back in time before the election during the debate hosted by Megyn Kelly she asked Trump the question about women. That was the one where Trump said, Only Rosie O'Donnell. Roger Stone resigned from the campaign (Trump claimed he fired him). Then a little later he joins Infowars. All of this is very weird. Jones has been in a lot of films and the media all make fun of him. He seems like he doesn't even bat an eye to all the negativity. It is looking to me like that is his job. It doesn't bother him and he is not afraid, because he is in on it. He has people all over the place using him as a "scapegoat" to make fun of "truthers". He freaks out with hysteria and fake crying. He makes sure guest don't say certain things.  It's like he is, "controlled opposition".Or better yet....they are all connected to the SEX CULT! Go to minute 3:30 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0-Sf4Fo9OMLike Q has indicated...THIS IS BIGGER THAN YOU IMAGINE, NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO WALK THE STREET, and TRUST NO ONE.

**MAIN DISCUSSION FORUM where PG investigation is happening**Disclaimer: Don't be surprised when you see some Trump-cultism in there. I suspect some of the mods there are compromised unfortunately, and allow a partisan bias to develop, to help make the investigation look politically motivated. www.voat.co/v/pizzagate

Someone is shadowbanned

Does anyone else REMEMBER that up until about 15-20 years ago, pedophilia related crimes were ALWAYS capital punishment offense?   mandela effect + pedogate?

Bottom line, this world is sick

Pegasus Museum. Still can‚Äôt get over the way he responded

Anyone ever try spying on the Bros?  Or Elephant ass?  What about test those supposed recordings of him threatening that dude?  Any serious follow ups or news?

What drives me crazy about you PedoGate enthusiasts is that you don't believe a word that the government says except when it comes to this topic, and then you not only believe that they're 100% telling the truth, you think that it's even bigger than they say.  You don't believe what the government says about the War on Drugs or the War on Terror, do you?  So why do you believe everything that the government says about their War on Prostitution?  

   Personally I find the Podesta stuff pretty incriminating, but the actual pizza place/Alefantis seems like a massive ton of conjecture.  Other than a gay guy with a weird sense of humor who takes a lot of pics with his goddaughter, is there any actual evidence?

I like to think about this as if everything that Podesta/Alefantis was accused of as merely coincidental just to see if it changes my mind. The freaky art and performances are simply a progressive, urban art style that my simple conservative mind can‚Äôt understand. The association with known pedos and deviants like Epstein, Silsby, Clinton, Weiner, and Richards are all coincidental. Just because their associates are guilty of certain crimes, doesn‚Äôt mean that Pgate is automatically true. Their relationships are established as somewhat close but not necessarily beyond a business capacity. These are wealthy people after all. Bill Clinton really is Chelsea‚Äôs father and Danney Williams is a hoax. We can never definitively prove either parentage without DNA, no matter how similar in appearance Hubbell/Williams may be to their alledged progenitors. All of the weird sexual comments involving minors and murder are unfortunately timed private jokes not meant for widespread scrutiny. All of the money associated with the political connections are no different than when conservative heavyweights promote their causes, and does not indicate a black market cabal. Clinton et al. really are simply progressive patriots that only wish to champion liberal causes and ideals but can‚Äôt escape constant stumpings by Trump. 

Its real

The original "Pedogate" and its original researchers were all focused on nationwide *U.S. military* and religious organized pedophilia.Now that is almost entirely ignored, and a politically-weaponized focus has replaced the old guard.  I wonder who would want that?[Here's an example of Dave McGowan talking about the nationwide military pedo-rings of the early 1980s](https://www.konformist.com/2001/pedophocracy3.htm) -- *pre-Clinton, pre-Podesta, and covered up by U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani, who would later exploit "Pizzagate" with the help of the NYPD.*

all this and not one creepy biden vid i am disappointed  edit: also no dan schneider foot fetish stuff :(

Where does Israel factor in based on your research so far?

Except this video and her allegations were debunked years ago and can be traced back to the satanic panic of the 80s and 90s.This interview came from a psychiatrist who claimed that people who have experienced trauma suppress their memories, and a certain kind of treatment can recover these memories. It turned out to be total bullshit. It's basically the power of suggestion and coercing events. It actually had devastating consequences as a lot of people went to jail from people all of a sudden "remembering" things that didn't happen.After the satanic panic subsided, the psychiatrist admitted it was flawed. "Stuff You Should Know" covered this in more detail in [their podcast.](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/the-satanic-panic-of-the-1980s/) Satanic panic began with this book, Michelle Remembers https://seanmunger.com/2014/11/06/michelle-remembers-the-story-of-the-literary-hoax-that-started-a-tragic-moral-panic/Get informed about this stuff, none of these satanic cannibal pedo sex rings had been proven true. http://barristerblogger.com/2015/07/05/satanic-abuse-a-reply-to-believers/>>It was first pointed out in the United States that no material evidence of ritual or satanic practices had been forthcoming in any of the cases in which they had been alleged. In Britain the position has been substantially the same as far as allegations of satan-worshiping rituals are concerned. As one journalist put it, in a phrase that has become well-known: **Investigations have produced no bodies, no bones, no bloodstains, nothing.** In the United States, the only adult witness to corroborate the testimony of children in a case has continued to claim that her evidence was given ‚Äòto get it all over with‚Äô and was the result of plea-bargaining. An FBI agent, Kenneth Lanning, has reported that he has been unable to document any satanic murders in the United States. While this book was being written, a report of a very large study carried out be Gail Goodman and associates in the United States claimed that none of the cases reported to them produced any evidence of the existence of organized satanic worship that included sexually abusing children.¬†¬†https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&pg=PA5&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false**[List of satanic ritual abuse allegations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_satanic_ritual_abuse_allegations)**  ---   >During the 1980s and 90s a moral panic about alleged satanic ritual abuse occurred, mainly in parts of the English speaking world. This was propagated by certain psychotherapists, social workers, Christian fundamentalists and law enforcement officials. Some of the cases ended in prosecution and imprisonment. Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have had several incidents of alleged SRA which received national and international news coverage. Other countries have also had isolated events in which abuse or murder took place with satanic ritual elements, including Argentina and Brazil.  ---          

I learned they use adrenochrome as toppings on pizza to make it more palatable. So it's special pizza per slice...Find another motive to those abusing children for more than orgasm slaves.

Reddit = corporate censorship.  Alternatives: Voat.co, Saidit.net, Gab.aiDo yourself a favor and opt-out!Here's the app I'm using to edit my comments:https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuiteYou should too! 

I know you don't want to hear this (and you'll probably think I'm some sort of troll, rather than a middle aged New Englander and mother), but this is the way people my age (50s-60s) write, socially.  Yes, it is.  It's idiomatically correct, complete with weekends 'at the farm' and 'being entertained by the grandkids in the pool'.  It's the way a certain slice of polite society writes, semi-formally.  I enjoy Reddit and find this sub fascinating at times, and I'm not commenting on the broader topic here.  But regarding these emails: you have this piece (at least) wrong.  This is, in fact, the way socially well connected, good friends communicate.  

IMO, this is the weakest part of the pizzagate 'evidence'The 'real meanings' of these 'codes' were just a random image post on 4chan, nothing backing them up.The real sort of 'damning' thing that I've never really seen an adequate explanation for is James Alefetanis' instagram profile. Some real eye\-brow raising stuff on there, with ACTUAL pedo\-slang. No one has ever really explained why his insta profile picture is Antinous.Also, Alefetanis has shown up on 4chan and threatened a pizzagate researcher with veiled threats of grievous bodily harm.ALSO: how hardcore this thing was buried and stopped, to me, lends credence to it's veracity.I've dug so deep into this shit, and once you do, you realize 'pizzagate' is a bad term, because it makes people think, 'oh yah, children in a hidden basement in a pizza parlor, riiiiight' But the real issue is political pedophilia, which has been shown time and time again, in court documents no less, to exist. Once you understand the profile of a psychopath, you can begin to understand how most people in high positions of power ARE psychopaths; from there, it makes sense that they'd get off on 'the destruction of something innocent', as it's the most transgressive thing ever and THEY can get away with it, also because it's the ultimate feeling of being God. These people don't experience empathy, compassion, fear, anxiety...they can only feel 'power'.TL;DR \- political pedophilia is real, 'pizzagate' is kind of a misnomer for what this investigation has become.

It's worth remembering that so much of the "evidence" for Pizzagate consists of out of context snippets of emails that were hacked and dumped by Russian intelligence. 

Nicely put.The only reason Pizza has any connection to pedogate is that on 4chan, CP is referred to as Cheese Pizza. To 4channers, pizza is synonymous with CP.

There was nothing about live stream Web cams on the blog and it wasn't run by Tamera. Old comment I've saved below :https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/63l7zm/tamera_lozzatto_from_the_invite_only_emails_zoom/dfvgvb3This was a blog of cute baby pictures with a few videos. Tamera Luzzatto did not run the blog, Evie's father did.The blog was not invite-only until internet stalkers started harassing the Luzzattos.

The RNC is not [innocent](http://www.voxfux.com/features/bush_child_sex_coverup/franklin.htm) 

There are many significant and explosive U.S. and world pedo events involving current in-office leaders (across the political spectrum).  But I never see them posted here.I refuse to post them because Reddit is a potential military/intelligence propaganda wet dream, mods are unelected & unaccountable, and even this thread is being manipulated.  Moreover, as I wrote in this thread in a now-hidden comment, the Military-Industrial-Pedo Complex (as Eisenhower should have called it) is way bigger than a Pizza Shop or the Clinton Foundation.  CF has $250 million, and the Pentagon has famously "lost" trillions.  Why wouldn't the military love a decoy Clinton scapegoat?  According to Fiona Barnett, the U.S. military breeds their own off-the-books children for sex, slavery & sacrifice.  Why bother with risky human trafficking?  They just breed their own -- which was also suggested by The Finders children who had never seen running water, television or electricity.

 

If anyone has any doubts this "conspiracy" isn't 100% partisan, mention something about Trump and Epstein or Epstein and Acosta and watch if you get downvotes or upvotes. 

A lot of conservatives who believe pizzagate is real believe it is bipartisan and that the Bush family was involved.

 The Bush and Reagan administrations we're investigated several years ago, for using the services of a call boy ring.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTitnDgw3GcNobody here is picking favorites, and part of branding the investigation as a partisan "witch hunt" was a way to smear our efforts. Look up the Franklin scandal, several high level republicans were implicated.

 

Pizzagate goes on both sides of the political isle. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton and her campaign manager running an elite sex ring out of a pizza shop along with other DNC heavyweights‚Äù is disinformation. NXIVM is part of the ‚Äúelite sex ring‚Äù without a doubt. Allison Mack is singing like a bird and she is just the tip of the iceberg. This is a global problem and it‚Äôs a global network.  

Can't come forward if they're in the ground or dissolved..

That's bull crap. The Franklin Scandal had Bush and other republicans involved and I think it's all connected. Stop making this partisan.

What happened 73 days ago? I bet that was a weird day. 

> elite sex ring out of a pizza shop alongDid you copy and paste this from an article?

> the "facts" of pizzagate are all a republican's wet dreamThe Pizzagate Scandal has brought a lot of attention to human trafficking. I know a lot of people learned about the Franklin Credit Union Scandal with Republican Lawrence E. King after reading about Pizzagate.Also in the Podesta Emails, Tony Podesta [talks about his close relationship with Fmr. Speaker of the House and serial child molester/Republican Dennis Hastert.](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488)I know for sure that Pizzagate has "red-pilled" a lot of people about the [Fmr. Republic President George H. W. Bush's Midnight Call Boy Scandal.](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3llQwO2uuKo/Wb0QiSFzQXI/AAAAAAAAoNY/UX0aN1A9GWABVYEDYaLuYJuR9kXznAq4QCLcBGAs/s1600/Washington%2BTimes%252C%2BJune%2B29%252C%2B1989%2BHomo%2BVIP%2BRing%2BFront%2BPage.gif)A lot of Republican Scandals are being discovered because of the discussions on Pizzagate. [Plus we have a history of Israeli, British, and Russian agents blackmailing US Congress Members through elite pedophile rings in Washington D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/27/nyregion/boy-sex-rings-said-to-peddle-client-data-to-foreign-agents.html), so it's definitely not just democrats. > Without a single victim having come forward?It would be very difficult for victims of human trafficking to just come forward, especially if they're very young kids, which they would be in this case; if not toddlers.Actually I will link you to an alleged victim: [I was sexually assaulted 8 years ago by the Pizzagate guy, owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5opvyd/i_was_sexually_assaulted_8_years_ago_by_the/)Very interesting case. A lot of info was scrubbed. I'm sure you can find some archives/screen shots out there. He posted a picture, but I'm not sure if it's in the thread. I know he 100% posted a picture. He would've had to put in a lot of effort to fake all of this. Here are some alleged emails between the victim and James Alefantis: https://archive.is/SHacUThe story goes that James Alefantis raped the guy in the AMA, and he *also* raped Comet Ping Ping Co-Owner Carole Greenwood's son. He allegedly raped him in the kitchen. I do remember reading an article where Carole's son Dylan stayed over in a big house together with James Alefantis and David Brock in Georgetown, but that would've been before the age he would've been according to the AMA. My point is they do have a link. I think the question is, why did Carole Greenwood quit Comet Ping Pong? An article has stated that it was due to family reasons. Did James Alefantis do something to her son?

Dude a bunch of emails got dumped and we read through them and investigated the people in them and sending them and they were/are fucked

no since that's not the case and trump is an Epstein pal

The amount of projection in that thread is astounding. People speak out against what they consider a gross injustice, and they try to spin it into being a "defense" of said injustice, which makes no sense whatsoever. They're really reaching, with this one.

Certain users are suspiciously upvoted too. Kinda blatant. They should try being a little more subtle if they wanna be believable. 

The thread is being brigaded, by the usual suspects, and known defenders of pedophilia.

What age were the victims she recruited? 

I think it makes perfect sense that select, high-ranking government people would be into pedo stuff. A lot of these people get into government because they're narcissists who crave power, a typical trait for narcissists. Another typical trait for narcissists: feeling above the law/morality. Combine a lack of morality with a craving for extreme dominance and control, and you have a recipe for a rapist or pedophile. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-GZFHLAcG8AHere's Ben Swann's Pizzagate report from last year. His social media went dark after this video.

Idk if you know about it but /r/greatawakening would love your work. I know you‚Äôve been doing this since the beginning, and it‚Äôs all good work. Apparently we‚Äôre getting close. 

The thing is he is right.Global pedophile ring? Legit.Hillary Clinton + Pals running paedophilic rng out of edgy pizza pallor? Obvious horse shit.

They use art as not only a way to laundry money, but as a symbol and the art is very telling what this man is into. Signs and symbols rule the world. I know for a fact this is how they do this, Check out Darin Vance from WA. He was just convicted, took only five years. This is how they communicate thru visual, borderline criminal content that is hard to bring justice to. 

there is however reasonable evidence for the use of coded language. The accused has never once addressed this, been asked by the media about this, or tried to explain himself. Being emailed to ask if you wanted your used handkerchief with a 'pizza map' on it returned is not normal, and it deserves scrutiny. 

Nothing for 3 months but when the pizzagate bell rings you're here in 5 minutes. I'm impressed.This should be an interesting thread.

Tony is good friends with serial child molester Dennis Hastert, who served as speaker of the house for nearly a decade. Tony and John both have EXTREMELY questionable interests in art, a long with James Alefantis. Bill Clinton is good friends with convicted child trafficker and pedo Jeffrey Epstein, who was in a relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell (daughter of Mossad agent Robert Maxwell) and was sued by Virginia Roberts who has claimed she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew under age. She is also pictured with Prince Andrew. Those are the facts. It is very eyebrow rising and what I touched on is literally only the tip of the iceberg. 

Did you look at all the evidence? That's like saying there is no indication 9/11 was an inside job.

"Trump's campaign chair" is pretty misleading. He was in charge of a state-level RNC campaign office (in OK iirc). He was prosecuted, and rightfully so. There were quite a few mainstream articles about the case, and essentially nobody, here or anywhere, made any effort to defend him or what he did.

pizzagate is one lead in pedogate.  why do you want to ignore this lead?

The two topics are pretty closely related, and there has always been bleed-over between Hollywood and the political world. Assuming Pedogate and Pizzagate are true, there are undoubtedly predators and victims who have one foot in both.

direct opposite, not doing so is a disservice to the pizzagate victims

http://crazydaysandnights.netThis Hollywood Attorney is stating he was murdered down to confronting Oman royalty over his "new" minor wife. Upon confronting the man, he was murdered the next day.

This was an amazing link until some of the links became broken in time. Not hard to find the images that were deleted with a google search so here it is.

My thoughts almost exactly.  I also think many believe they are demonically possessed or wish they were etc.  Games of power played out at sick rituals seeing who can play along, who is eager and who wants to puke.

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:- [/r/topmindsofreddit] [Thread not going your way?

Changing the rules for one thread but not for all is interesting.  Any good conspiracy theorist sees manipulation and wonders whose agenda is being served.

Always look out for [common forum disruption tactics](http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/). Be aware of the [massive number of online shills](https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j1y5la6q&sh=75667764) attempting to control public opinion. Don't believe the votes on reddit, most of the shilling operations have large numbers of vote bots.

It randomises the comment thread order each time you load, and hides the scores. It can help avoid certain comments getting no visibility from mass downvotes as the top comment could be upvoted or downvoted, but you wouldn't know. It's just so users can focus on what people are saying, as opposed to focusing on the numbers. 

>If he wasn't, why would he have threatened a voat Pizzagate researcher with killing his entire family and "suing his dead body" if he didn't remove one of his posts exposing a property of Alefantis' as a potential trafficking hub, the "Pegasus Museum"?The simple answer is that the "threats" didn't actually happen and Ryan faked the whole thing. That report doesn't actually show what he told the police.* He [reported the supposed threat](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7l5vhe/voat_researcher_ryan_oneal_exposed_the_location/drkavv3/) *hours after* he made/uploaded the video you link. You can check the upload time [here](https://citizenevidence.amnestyusa.org/).* His only other evidence was screenshots. He's from Texas where a simple google search reveals conversations can be [lawfully recorded.](https://www.rcfp.org/reporters-recording-guide/state-state-guide/texas) Why didn't he record any of his conversations with the police, or the FBI? He even admits that the thought went through his head. Yet, no action...* He claimed he ["tried"](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rhyrl/i_am_the_owner_of_pizzagategearcom_and_the_guy/dd7eysq/) to record his conversations with JA *twice*. One of the times he had a "buddy" next to him and neither of them thought to at least video-record the conversation. The next time, Alefantis gives him a warning before the supposed call, but Ryan still doesn't record the conversation (despite having allegedly been threatened before). Why didn't he ever call him back and record that?* He claimed to have reported Alefantis to the FBI and that they told him not to ["poke the bear"](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rhyrl/i_am_the_owner_of_pizzagategearcom_and_the_guy/dd7dycw/?context=3). Yet, he continued to [talk about PG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcppgo_Slk-_BeGVZtyqONw) and [sell pizzagate merchandise](http://web.archive.org/web/*/pizzagategear.com) for like a year afterwards. * If the FBI really looked into it, why haven't they found anything? Why didn't he ever provide evidence of the report? * If the FBI is "in on it" and/or he were really threatened by Alefantis, why would he continue to sell pizzagate merchandise and vlogging about pizzagate? It doesn't look like he took the "threat" very seriously. Or it was, you know, made up.

Comet Ping Pong was likely just a money laundering front. Alefantis (changed from Rothschild) is the crypto banker of the family. 

Source?

Never heard this one before but it's interesting. Sure makes the motive for their very public and very gruesome execution and the Clintons direct oversight of it as well.Then imagine any victims that might come forward could be shown that as a cautionary tale.

you mean death penalty? no that was never the case

Help me out here. What on earth does PG have to do with "trusting government"?

we  believe govt on this topic?

no there is not a shred of evidence. but that is why the less fortunate (cognitively) will continue to post as if there is. Its almost as sad as it is interesting. 

He's clearly guilty of something. If he wasn't, why would he have threatened a voat Pizzagate researcher with killing his entire family and "suing his dead body" if he didn't remove one of his posts exposing a property of Alefantis' as a potential trafficking hub, the "Pegasus Museum"? https://youtu.be/qBn7ja_oegM

The Alefantis stuff is pretty strange however. Here‚Äôs CPP being called out in 2008http://archive.is/ezdQEHere's people posting about comet ping pong https://archive.is/FMLbxhttps://archive.fo/mKH6MJames Alefantis' sister, Susan Alefantis wrote a letter in support of a teacher who was convicted of molesting 5 girls:https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/835178/kloman-letter-writers.pdfHere is an article on the abuser: https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/potomac-school-investigation-uncovers-more-alleged-abuse/2014/06/30/57abfa0e-0072-11e4-8fd0-3a663dfa68ac_story.html

 

And Franklin Scandal victim Paul Bonacci stated that Lawrence King's pedo-ring was operated out of Fort Offutt.  Bonacci said they knew LK at the guard gate, and waved him through without ID.Dutroux victims pointed the original investigators (who were removed) at Belgium's NATO headquarters.Australian elite-pedo whistleblower Fiona Barnett (now missing as of late 2017) said she was a child sex slave on U.S. military bases.

The name Arun Rao is connected through James Alefantis‚Äô Instagram. He works for the DOJ and he is also responsible for prosecuting human traffickers. Many people have accurately pointed out between Arun Rao and Andrew Kline, this may be the most significant incident of the ‚Äòfox guarding the hen house‚Äô we have ever seen.https://steemit.com/wikileaks/@ausbitbank/besta-pizza-is-owned-by-andrew-kline-of-the-human-trafficking-prosecution-unit-of-the-doj-pizza-parties-exposedBesta Pizzaowned by former DOJ employee Andrew Klinea position he was appointed to by Bill Clintonhttps://dcpizzagate.wordpress.com

Indeed, and I would *consider* that a badge of honor, personally.(edit: forgot a word)

About the same as the US, the UK, France or any other country for that matter.

that was obviously a cover up.  It's definitely real.  The victims who speak out are far more convincing than some "expert" debunking. They haven't been proven true because they own the system.  They continue to get away with their crimes because of the apathetic public.   They created the system.  Court houses are actually Satanic Temples created to take away humans natural law.  The US government is actually still owned by the British baby eating Crown.  https://aim4truth.org/2018/05/04/the-british-crown-runs-the-u-s-legal-system/These are the richest people in the world doing this stuff.  The "El- ite".  It is in the name itself.  These rulers are satanists and they can continue to cover up the truth because they created the entire system.  Just look at Michael Aquino...  The guys started an off shoot of the The Satanic Church called the Temple of Set.  He is an admitted Satanist and he was in charge of US military psychological operations.  If that doesn't bring up any red flags in your mind, you've been got.  Satanists run the world, of course their not going to bust themselves.  heres Hillary Clinton in a leaked email by "russian hackers"  (irrelevant)  where she says she is going to sacrifice a chicken to Moloch in the Backyard.   https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333

I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre disagreeing! I‚Äôm trying to argue that this exchange is just an innocuous set of emails friends sent each other back and forth and nothing else!

Thank you for this. I honestly believe that some of the people that harp on what is said in some of those emails have ZERO clue on how some people speak to each other. In life it is important to be able to discern. Some around here don‚Äôt have that gift.

one hundred percent this. and to understand that the lefts hard push for sexual acceptance also includes that of pedophilia, and that this issue is global and not just within the usa. in the uk for example  labour \(leftleaning centrist party\)politician over here NAME REDACTED actually put her name on a legal document supporting a group known as PIE\(Pedophile information exchange\) who supported relationships between pedophiles and young male adolescents claiming: ‚ÄúPaedophiles are ordinary, decent, sensible human beings, no more sexually depraved than yourself, and with a capacity for loving and helping children which is at present being repressed.‚ÄùIf you, or I, were to go to work tomorrow and even suggest that we supported such views we would be fired and persecuted by those amongst us. However, for politicians this isn't damning? It shows how rife it.Is this truly a case of ancient wealth retaining ancient customs ala the ancient greeks and their boy\-loving ways? **#pedocracy**

The one email I‚Äôd like an explanation for is the pizza related map handkerchief. That is the one that gets me. 

Question, if he showed up in 4chan how do we know it was him? I could claim to be anyone.

>that were hacked and dumped by Russian intelligence. No. This is an assumption, not a fact.

Thats bullshit. The people who hacked them told everyone how they did it. His password was literally p@ssword

If we're doing info dumps I've got some links to a load of original/early days pizzagate stuff.  Cheesebay/Biff Skipman/Molokai, Hawaii, Haiti etc etc  https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/71e9c2/z/dnanhnt  https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7e4zw4/z/dq31bvu

With all due respect, how is it spam? The ‚Äúdominoes on cheese or on pasta‚Äù has been cited as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù regarding Pizzagate in threads such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ivs7e/fully_sourced_excellent_summary_of_pizzagate/?st=JGQT1JJ3&sh=fe4b7f52)I provided context using primary sources, about a phrase that is commonly cited regarding pizzagate.

Good work. Thank you for moderating the thread. 

Here is Cohen, having a cigar with a known sex trafficker... just the other day   The guy in the cigar buddy photo with Cohen is Tevfik Arif https://i.imgur.com/R5GeMtR.pngHe‚Äôs a Russian Turk who was busted for sex trafficking in 2010 http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/trump-associate-charged-running-prostitution-ring-article-1.187634You can give him a google. He‚Äôs gone grey and balding since the photo with Trump.

Youre right its scary to post the creepy biden videos especially 

Children take time to raise. That is why, even though there may be evidence for them breeding their own children, it's not always the easiest way. 

can you post that thread you replied in?

How did Trump create these circumstances? We're these not the circumstances before he was elected? 

I'll give it a try. Ahem.According to that book on the Epstein evils, when Trump found out about Epstein's connections with underage rape stuff, he banned him from Mar-a-lago and his other properties.

The current republican party (as run by Trump) is extremely anti-bush, so that does not change my argument

>Bush administration/s? had call boys.They were homosexuals liaisons between adults.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_J._SpenceLumping them with pedophile claims is disingenuous and homophobic.

Must be a hell of an operation without a single leak

Can't come forward if they never existed, either. And since there's no evidence of them existing at all...

This concerted effort to claim it was never about a pizza shop would work better if "pizza" wasn't in the name. 

> The AMA was removed because after further inspection of the proof, it wasn't up to our standards. Once he has better proof, we'll be happy to let him repost it.Kind of an iffy link there.

If I make an AMA stating without evidence that Trump and Putin pounded my asshole in a Moscow hotel in 2013, will you cite that as proof too?

> Actually I will link you to a victim: I was sexually assaulted 8 years ago by the Pizzagate guy, owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis AMA!That person's claims involve them being an adult when sexually harassed. As bad as that *might* be (given that it's a completely anonymous accusation), it's no where near the accusations of pedophilia, murder, or trafficking.Furthermore, when people ask for victims, they're not saying to show us victims coming forward. They are asking for evidence that the victims even exist. Were any of the accused behaving strangely right before a child they were involved with disappeared? Was blood found in their freezer? Do people consistently go missing after meeting them? These would be examples of some kind of evidence that the victims even *exist*.Pizzagate simply has none of this evidence. Only anonymous accusations. And in the case of the link you sent, not even really "pizzagate"-related, since they were not a minor, and weren't trafficked or murdered. Like I said earlier, not excusing that behavior **if** it's actually true, but it hardly supports your claim that pizzagate victims exist.

Australian elite-pedo victim Fiona Barnett, who was born into a pedo-ring run by a U.S. military network, said that the U.S. military breeds their own children for sex, slavery & sacrifice.  The Finders were transporting children who had "never seen running water, television or electricity."Fiona Barnett has been almost 100% ignored by this subreddit.  She was loud & vocal for years, had her own podcast & website, and then she went missing in late 2017.As of May 3, I guarantee you will find thousands of Pizzagate posts in a search of this subreddit.  I guarantee you will find a couple dozen posts about Fiona Barnett maximum.  Until later this week, so Reddit can cover their tracks.  Fiona Barnett:  A recently living witness who couldn't get the time of day from r/conspiracy.  Maybe because she had no weaponized partisan political value?Maybe also because she dared blame the U.S. military, with its vast budget & international resources?  And every pre-Pizzagate pedo-ring scandal supports that conclusion?  Meanwhile it looks like I'm supposed to pay more attention to a Pizza shop who flaunt pedo symbols, than to the multi-trillion-dollar Pentagon.  Alefantis *wants* you to notice, but with no victims who will prosecute (unlike Franklin, Fiona or Dutroux, all with military connections).

Does sex trafficking draw a line at age?

your username means I love kids in french.I love how you, of all user names, are so adamant about shutting down pedophile exposing discussions.

It's psychopaths, not narcissists. The dark triad, which is Machavellism, Psychopathy, and Narcissism. People think only serial killers have this, but serial killers are low\-functioning psychopaths that got caught. The more adept ones move into positions of power easily.I say 'psychopathy' because these people literally have a lower orbital lobe that has decreased or non\-existent functioning...that part of the brain is thought to be responsible for fear, anxiety, compassion, and empathy. People with a psychopathic brain are more likely to be into shit like pedophilia, as it's the ultimate form of 'power', one of the only 'emotions' they can 'feel'

Or is it the other way around, and the CIA supports the candidacy of pedophiles whom they can control while in office?Edit: see Dennis Hastert

But there's evidence that elite pedophile rings have existed in Washington D.C. Why is it so far-fetched to imagine operations taking place at various interconnected properties in D.C. If you're willing to admit that global pedophile rings exist, can you describe how you think the operations/logistics of an elite pedophile ring operating out of Washington D.C. would work?

Let's also remember that the idea that pizzagate was simply "Hillary Clinton + Pals running paedophilic rng out of edgy pizza pallor?" was the MSM story they used to discredit it, by taking the dumbest bits and omitting plenty of other aspects so they could "debunk" it. 

What's art got to do with Podestas emails?Why does laundering money through art indicate pedophile activity to you? 

Ok. Who used the so called code words "pizza map"? 

If that user appears for pizzagate threads and you see them every time then you too appear for pizzagate threads.  Interesting.

The same goes for fukushima and setagaya observer. Its like they have a bot that notifies when certain topics are discussed. Nah thats crazy I doubt it..

Well, thanks for noticing I suppose! 

 

[removed]

Raised eyebrows aren't evidence that Podesta or Alefantis are pedophiles.Do you have any? 

> Tony is good friends with serial child molester Dennis Hastertthere are hundreds of people that are/were friends with Dennis Hastert. it doesn't mean anything in terms of convicting someone for being a pedophile/trafficker, nor does an interest in unconventional art.>Bill Clinton is good friends with convicted child trafficker and pedo Jeffrey Epsteinso is Donald Trump, and hundreds of other people. again, it doesn't mean anything. Trump frequented Epstein's fantasy island like Clinton, but there are no accusations against him, nor should there be unless there's evidence suggesting otherwise.I don't know how narcissistic elites being friends with other narcissistic elites is eyebrow-raising.

Don't forget the email sent to John Podesta re: Hastert being busted"Might be time for Denny to vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11508

I've looked at probably 95% of the pizzagate allegations.There isn't any actual evidence to speak of. 

Oo I never knew it was at the state level. Thanks for the reply.

Because it's nonsense and detracts from real pedo cases. 

Yes, but one is fiction, the other is reality. 

What victims???

man this site is hard to read.. any tips on decrypting it?

[Here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq-knHXSKYY)

Which is kind of funny because he obviously can't explain the bizarre code language. I really wish he would explain that damn handkerchief with the pizza related map on it.

Lol....Also, note how it's the same few accounts spewing the same canned "debunking" talking points. 

There were more than a few comments complaining about the obvious vote manipulation before this happened. Only trolls had heavy upvotes and most of the regulars offering good faith comments with links to sources were in the negative. Setting sort to random solves the problem created by the vote manipulation, but unfortunately, you can't even see the votes anymore to know that it had happened. That's unfortunate. 

any great conspiracy theorist would recognize this can't serve an agenda because it's just randomizing everything. 

Mastigia has always been fair and impartial

I like it

>The simple answer is that the "threats" didn't actually happen and Ryan faked the whole thing. That report doesn't actually show what he told the police.Are you claiming that Ryan fabricated evidence against Alefantis, and filed a false report to the police \(a report they acknowledged as legitimate\), all as an elaborate ruse to sell more shirts? That doesn't sound very plausible to me.Sounds like it would be highly illegal and dangerous move to fabricate evidence against the 49th most powerful person in Washington D.C. If this is all a stunt as you claim, then why hasn't Ryan been arrested after filing the false report?I understand that attacking the credibility of a whistleblower or a witness is a common tactic in discrediting them.[https://dc.eater.com/2012/1/18/6621675/gq\-names\-jose\-andres\-james\-alefantis\-among\-most\-powerful\-people\-in](https://dc.eater.com/2012/1/18/6621675/gq-names-jose-andres-james-alefantis-among-most-powerful-people-in)

must be why the CPP computer got shot

Dont they also use the art?Not sure if it's true, it is believable, elites use art shipments to smuggle because they somehow get a customs pass - on Ray Donovan show and I need to look into it.These tv shows for propaganda sure seem to give things away but maybe it's a psyop of nothing on tv is real.  The syfy show Happy! Was insanely creepy and also satisfying as the dad went nuts.

I don't know anything about the name change or the laundering, but it's not entirely implausible, but I think what can be proved is that a lot of high powered DC pedo's liked to hang out there and all the creepy art/entertainment and ads by alefantis himself speak to this.

The art was for money laundering. Why else would Alefantis own Pegasus Art Museum, but not advertise or put any signs out showing it exists? 

Prepare for the nasty truth:http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread495669/pg1EDIT: it's pretty sad http://www.apfn.org/apfn/elites.htm

David Koresh was the only Christian who stood up against the secret societies behind the goverment

The government is arresting people for prostitution and calling it "sex trafficking."  There is no "sex trafficking" and there is certainly no "child sex trafficking" in the U.S. but the PG nuts buy into everything that the government says.

Dude seriously? Do you have any idea how simple it is to fake a text conversation with somebody? 

The Facebook chat was faked. The guy that started the rumour runs www.pizzagategear.com and is trying to make money off it. He also has an unsuccessful patron which used to have text about supporting pizzagate investigation here  https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=5133398Here's the police report * https://imgur.com/a/vct1i* http://p2c.websterpd.com (search Case #:¬†**17000111**) * docdroid.net/LZTsdj5/policereport.pdf.htmlAnd here's a transcript of the alleged Facebook chat with James Alefantis which if you read it looks like it was written by an idiot.---The screen-captured chat went as follows:Alefantis: Just the Pegasus video. Figure out how to do it ‚Äî no waves.O‚ÄôNeal: I am a super reasonable guy. You don‚Äôt have to scare me like that.Alefantis: You can keep your kill room shit about the rest of it. Fix this and we are reasonable.[Alefantis then sent a picture of O‚ÄôNeail and his mom].Alefantis: Thanks. Feel ok?O‚ÄôNeal: Not really. Just threatened to kill everybody.Alefantis: No need for all of that.O‚ÄôNeal: Deleted the video.Alefantis: Good. Blame YouTube.O‚ÄôNeal: Delete the thread on Voat too?Alefantis: They are taking things down. I think be more creative. Say you think it‚Äôs nothing or something ‚Äî it‚Äôs your culture. CAlm down and think about it first.O‚ÄôNeal: Ok.Alefantis: Let‚Äôs look and discuss. This might be ok. Thank you. Let me know when you have calmed a bit.O‚ÄôNeal: Give me a week.Alefantis: Ha. Welcome to my world. Call me quick I‚Äôll be nice this time. I appreciate you taking down.O‚ÄôNeal: I‚Äôm riding around with somebody. Gimme a minute.[Alefantis then sent a picture of O‚ÄôNeal and his girlfried].Alefantis: CuteO‚ÄôNeal: Is that you being nice?Alefantis: Not yet. So call quick then I can go to bed with less worries.O‚ÄôNeal: Mods deleted posts on Voat. 5 minutes.Alefantis: Ok. What‚Äôs mods?O‚ÄôNeal: Moderators.Alefantis: Humm draws attention?O‚ÄôNeal: They deleted because my content was removed I guess. Reason: 1 2 3.Alefantis: Humm. Looks there.O‚ÄôNeal: Says deleted. ‚ÄúIt looks like you are trying to make money off this.‚Äù Link doesn‚Äôt work.Alefantis: That‚Äôs on Voat. ?.O‚ÄôNeal: About to call.[At this point O‚ÄôNeal called Alefantis back and said that ‚Äúhe was nicer‚Äù but still assured him he ‚Äúwould die‚Äù if he did not pull the video down].Alefantis: Ok. One more thing this ‚Äúhappened to me.‚Äù YOU ‚Äî created this. You can uncreate.O‚ÄôNeal: It‚Äôs an interesting subject. Just doing research on a hobby basically. I would never want myself or family to have any harm done because of this.Alefantis: Meaning ‚Äî you created it for yourself ‚Äî you can uncreate. Yeh well it‚Äôs good you didn‚Äôt end up like Welch ‚Äî in jail for 35 years. Or everyone who ‚Äòs getting sued. You can find a much more profitable and beneficial hobby.O‚ÄôNeal: I mean nothing I did was wrong but wrong or not it‚Äôs just not worth it.Alefantis: Actually lots of what you did is illegal. And punishable. But it‚Äôs expensive to sue. So people don‚Äôt do it. I can explain it to you someday. There would also be criminal ‚Äî state charges on some of it. But you would need someone smart enough and connected who wanted to make sure it was enforced. And so far you don‚Äôt have that.O‚ÄôNeal: Took down the video. You win by a landslide.Alefantis: So go to sleep. Thank you for that. It‚Äôs appreciated. And by the way this story is a pack of lies.O‚ÄôNeal: What is it then? Pure garbage?Alefantis: Yup. I mean that wall is the same wall.O‚ÄôNeal: Oh I confirmed that lol.Alefantis: But what the hell does that mean. And our families deserve to be safe.O‚ÄôNeal: No doubt. What y‚Äôall building in the room? Why the trenches?Alefantis: You are too much man. On the edge of total destruction ‚Äî still curious?O‚ÄôNeal: I‚Äôm curious for myself. No worries.Alefantis: FBI liked your videos. So there is something. And. PLUMBING. Have you ever run plumbing?O‚ÄôNeal: lol.Alefantis: To build a room it‚Äôs not trenches. Any basic construction moron would see the differ next.O‚ÄôNeal: So the kill room stuff was just a joke?Alefantis: DifferenceO‚ÄôNeal: IDK about that stuff.Alefantis: Ugh.O‚ÄôNeal: Sorry sorry I‚Äôll stop.Alefantis: You don‚Äôt know what.

It's definitely not real and nothing was covered up, the story was covered extensively in UK media.

Oh, good.  Sorry that I misunderstood.  It is the one piece that I do wish people would drop, or at least de-emphasize.   Many media people would be baffled by these types of emails trotted out as evidence of some heinous crime.  (It's the inversion of us older people thinking anything posted on 4chan is from a Russian hacker.  It's eye roll inducing and lowers the credibility of anything else said.)

How about looking at Trump's own words instead of some guy's book?> I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.

The current republican party hates Trump and consistently makes decisions and moves that further ostracize the chunk of Americans that solidly support Trump. They dragged Bush senior out to make comments about Trump's performance as president and candidate and tried to get Dubya to do the same. Don't forget that Jeb had full establishment backing too. 

Senator John DeCamp of Nebraska represented children in court and his book who had specifically accused George Bush Sr of child molestation. There is a lot of interesting evidence and testimony about it, and even more about the cover up that followed. He's just one example. 

Part of the reason they're lumped in is Bush's involvement in covering up the case in Omaha Nebraska.

Craig Spence hosted parties that provided any kind of sex his guests wanted, including with children. Although he was certainly hiring the services of an adult male prostitution service, he was also a partner of Larry King's pedophile network.

>Lumping them with pedophile claims is disingenuous and homophobic.The "[How dare you](http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/)" method of disrupting a discussion.>They were homosexuals liaisons between adults. The Washington Times [reported](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/File:Franklin-nyt.gif) there were "call boys," not adults. The book [The Franklin Scandal](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Document:The_Franklin_Scandal) explains:>The Washington Times reported that Spence spent $20,000 a month on prostitutes for himself and his associates, and that he had the juice to arrange midnight tours of the White House for himself, his friends, and the ‚Äúcall boys‚Äù whose services he leased. Paul Bonacci told Yorkshire Television that he was one of the ‚Äúcall boys‚Äù who took a midnight tour, and corroborated that King and Spence were partners in pedophiliac pandering.>A June 30, 1989 Washington Times article, ‚ÄúPower Broker Served Drugs, Sex At Parties Bugged for Blackmail,‚Äù revealed that audio and video recording devices were hidden in Spence‚Äôs home, and discussed his penchant for blackmail. A month later another article reported that Spence used sexually compromising photographs taken in his home to blackmail an associate.>Spence even told the Washington Times that his home had been bugged by ‚Äúfriendly" intelligence agents, and he continually dropped hints to friends and colleagues that he was freelancing for the CIA. The CIA denied this, but the Washington Times confirmed that Spence was a CIA asset. ‚ÄúWe had sources disclose that Spence wasn‚Äôt a direct employee,‚Äù says Rodriguez. ‚ÄúBut he did carry out services for the agency.‚Äù

Its no kind of stretch to connect paraphilias 

You should watch the documentary *Who Took Johnny?* (on Netflix, elsewhere).  It kind of touches on how deep the conspiracy can go through a power structure (local cops up through FBI), and how difficult it is to find victims and witnesses, and to even believe them when they tell their story.The documentary FYI follows the story of one abductee and survivor, from childhood to when he escaped and came forward in adulthood. Some of his initial claims sound insane, unbelievable... but then there are further developments that must be seen to be believed. It may change your mind on things.

Not really.  Not when they have dirt on everyone or means to create it for the few righteous police or politicians.  Or just threaten family or blow up their car - Michael Hastings.

130k employees and no leaks: [Manhattan project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project)Funny how that works huh

But The term "Pizzagate" is derived from the term "pizza" that is frequently found in odd context throughout the Podesta emails, not the comet ping pong connection.

> That person's claims involve them being an adult when sexually harassed. As bad as that might be (given that it's a completely anonymous accusation), it's no where near the accusations of pedophilia, murder, or trafficking.It means that if he has raped a young boy/man like the AMA alleges, then he is obviously more likely to rape/have already raped more young boys/men. Also how is it anonymous if he showed his face? He was verified by the moderators. > Furthermore, when people ask for victims, they're not saying to show us victims coming forward. They are asking for evidence that the victims even exist. Were any of the accused behaving strangely right before a child they were involved with disappeared? Was blood found in their freezer? Do people consistently go missing after meeting them? These would be examples of some kind of evidence that the victims even exist.What are you talking about? When people ask for victims, they are absolutely asking for victims to come forward. Evidence that victims even exist? Did the pictures of toddlers with black/purple bags under their eyes (due to sleep deprivation in my opinion) not do it for you? The child chewing on Euros. Actually since you want a bit more evidence than what I've already described, I'll link you a video from 2007. Washington neighborhood commissioner Frank Winstead staged a nighttime surveillance of a Northwest pizza place and put the resulting video up on YouTube -- [In the background of this video, you can hear a young girl **yelling for help**!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHXBrEXmowo) The couple walking by is confusingly turned around by the sound, as it is coming from Comet Ping Pong! It is NOT any of the children walking with the family, it is coming from Comet Ping Pong. It may even be coming from the sewer manhole... It is not a child "horsing around". Frank Winstead had no idea what he captured. He was filming because he had a lot of bones to pick with Comet Ping Pong, one of them being Comet's wish to stay open until 3AM. Frank thought it would attract crime to the area. In 2008, ANC Commissioner Frank Winstead accused the owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis, of "seeking to turn the quiet stretch of Connecticut Avenue in Forest Hills into a haven for rape and murder." During the course of the meeting, Winstead accused Comet owner James Alefantis of lying, cheating, stealing, spitting in a customers food, and encouraging both murderers and rapists.

Has the police done an investigation to confirm re: evidence?? 

Never heard of this case. Thanks I am going to research it.  I hope she is ok.I check new mostly all the time on this sub but for whatever reason never saw this.  I do get overwhelmed being a survivor of family abuse as a kid and take several weeks breaks or more. Maybe cut us some slack.

It's funny, the people who cry for evidence of victims instantly discredit them when they're found.I've seen people say that Ms. Barrett made everything up. Information warfare is real. 

What 

> Defending pedophilia is not at all similar to denying unproved, wild fantasies.It is when you accuse other of being guilty of what we're opposed to, and trying to raise awareness of, because people like you would rather sweep it under the rug and allow children to be molested.> In fact, I think the biggest proponents of pizzagate are the ones obsessed with kid fucking. Pizzagate is a partisan cult concoction.I wasn't referring to "Pizzagate" which I am equally skeptical of, however doubt the majority here are guilty of what you claim, objectively. It's illogical to assume so, at best. As far as Pizzagate being partisan, there are certainly partisan undertones to it for some, and a number of those who apolitical who subscribe to the theory. I'm more inclined to expose *actual* pedophiles in the hope that they are brought to justice. See my post above for perspective: https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8gqit5/rconspiracy_round_table_13_pizzapedogate_and/dyds282/

You have a tendency to show up in every single pedophilia conspiracy thread and attempt to derail conversations. 

>In fact, I think the biggest proponents of pizzagate are the ones obsessed with kid fucking. Pizzagate is a partisan cult concoction. Boom! 2 for 2 for y'all playing bingo at home ;)I hope we hit an alt-right, or maybe even a drumpf - I need this! 

Where did you hear that?Thw indictment doesn't mention minors.https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4443573-Raniere-Mack-Indictment.html#document/p2

Well, no. I was just curious if you knew the ages involved. I haven't followed that story closely. 

How am I shutting down discussions? I've been having discussions about pizzagate for months, in this thread alone I have dozens of comments. Your name has its roots in the Greek, Yoke-Finger. My name is a reference to a piece of pizzagate "evidence" ie a bar in Washington called l'enfant.https://i.imgur.com/CPdys3P.jpgNames are fun aren't they? 

I think it could be either. I studied narcissism in college, so that is just where my mind went. 

Obviously there are rings in DC but I just don‚Äôt think Comet Ping Pong has anything to do with or Podesta for that matter. There‚Äôs no solid evidence.

The MSM didn't name it Pizzagate.

Look at my last comment. You nailed it. It's become super easy to spot shills about this topic. A MAN SHOT UP THAT PIZZA SHOP SOMEONE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED (doesn't mention photos of Alefantis with the DC police commissioner, doesn't mention the cameras facing the building were pointed a different direction the day of the shooting, doesn't mention the one bullet shot destroyed the hardrive of the computer in the store, doesn't mention the shooter was a fucking actor)

Yes! I 100% agree, this is why I hate the branding effect of the name pizzagate. It was so effective! 

You're name is an anagram for James Alefantis, get outta here!

Go figure it out for yourself.. not that hard.

It was sent by Susan Sandler, of the Sandler Foundation (major donor to the DNC). Her exact phrasing was "The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus (sic)? They can send it if you want."Absolutely bizarre, yet no one has ever asked Podesta to explain it, nor any of the other questionable emails.

A realtor upon describing a handkerchief that was left behind at a property.

Are you forgetting he is a mod? Gary you‚Äôre getting lazy. Take a nap. 

True, however, I end up looking at most threads, whether I want to or not.

I saw the thread in /new and have some knowledge of pizzagate so... Here I am. 

Some people absolutely do have scripts running and alerting them of topics talking about different keywords to then try and derail said discussionI see a couple familiar faces already

I am not part of "they" you refer to. More like my account is a generally well sourced series of comments countering claims related to pizzagate.I make no judgement on "pedogate" which came after pizzagate and tried to associate the fake pizzagate story with real child abuse cases. 

Let's let the thread play out and try to stay focused on the data. This thread isn't going to change anyone's mind so folks should rehash the data, stay civil and agree to disagree.

Sure! Check out these links presented. All factual information.James calls his friend (holding a baby) a chicken loverhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6vdn22/the_nambla_chicken_hawk_expos%C3%A8_alefantis_chicken/To anyone claiming PG is debunked because "no basement" :https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7gwll2/to_anyone_claiming_pizzagate_is_debunked_because/See if you can complete these simple steps to debunk pizzagate!https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ciakx/some_simple_steps_to_debunk_pizzagate/Here's Tony's weird art collection:https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7aznh5/to_anyone_saying_tony_podestas_art_collection_and/Take into consideration he calls Dennis Hastert (serial child RAPIST) a good friend.Podesta also has a large subterranean vault under his house, and in Wikileaks dumps, he speaks of a "torture chamber". https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7a5coz/tony_podesta_has_a_huge_subterranean_vault/Again, this is just a small amount of circumstantial evidence compared to the mountains of creepy shit online.And I didnt't even touch on the Epstein/Prince Andrew/Bill Clinton/Trump connection.

This is simply further evidence that Pizzagate is a political witch-hunt. Podesta *received a forwarded email* and it's used as evidence that Podesta is a pedophile. An email that, quite frankly, reads like it's mocking the situating "Denny" is in. Podesta doesn't even bother to respond.Mike Pence actually goes out of his way to [defend the same pedophile](https://www.wthr.com/article/pence-defends-speaker-hastert) after he deliberately mishandled another sexual abuse scandal involving teenagers. And we get *crickets*.

You can certainly be forgiven for the misunderstanding because ShareBlue (most likely) repeated the misleading claim hundreds or thousands of times.

nothing wierd about James Alefantis visitng the white house the day before and the day after sandy hook...  Nothing weird about a pizza shop owner being listed as one of the 40 most powerful people in washington DC.  Nothing weird with his connections to the Rothschilds...Yeah sure guy.  The dude a kingpin. 

Quite the bold claim there. You have been able to disprove every pizzagate claim? Please share, I am sure the thread would love to see it.

Why are you asking John? It was Susan Sandler who referred to a "map that seems pizza related".And going by the code "Cheese pizza = child pornography" Susan's email becomes>map that seems pornography relatedWhich doesn't make much sense.It was Kathryn Tate in the email who first mentioned the handkerchief.

My name isn't an anagram of James Alefantis. Enfant has 2 n's. 

 

Within the first hour as well. As if they wanted to make it as obvious as possible. They're drawn to the word "pizzagate" like moths to a flame. 

it isnt randomizing things. In contest mode it isnt the votes of the comments its who spams the most... which is even more annoying.

"Appeal to reputation" is not how a system of accountability works.  Rules apply universally.  A [Bill of Attainder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder) is not legal for a reason.

Hey... it‚Äôs me Ryan. Nothing was fabricated. Yes i sold shirts. I also refunded everybody who bought a shirt when the shills shit their pants over it. Focus of shirts was spreading awareness. 100% of the marketing of pizzagate was controlled by MSM. I wanted to change that. Even if my motivation was to make money... it still happened. Pegasus is real. The threats are real. The info in the video is real. His reaction was real. The police report is real. The special agent i dealt with was real.

>Are you claiming that Ryan fabricated evidence against Alefantis, and filed a false report to the police (a report they acknowledged as legitimate), all as an elaborate ruse to sell more shirts? That doesn't sound very plausible to me.Right, because people never do things for money. /sHe wasn't only selling t-shirts. He was begging for donations on his channel and he had a Patreon.Although, it's really funny that you talk about plausibility when discussing pizzagate of all things. His videos are about taking a "killroom" hashtag on instagram as evidence of a literal murder. The replies on the picture also include a comment about werewolves, so I guess they're literally talking about man-beasts that roam the earth! /s Yet, in your mind, Ryan finding a "killroom" without evidence of the actual "kill" and then getting threatened by the murderer and warnings from the FBI is more plausible than him trying to take advantage of gullible people? Ok.>Sounds like it would be highly illegal and dangerous move to fabricate evidence against the 49th most powerful person in Washington D.C. Oh come on, do you believe everything you read in GQ? There were party planners ahead of him on that list for crying out loud lol. What kind of "power" do you think these people have? He was dating David Brock at the time, which would have put him on the radar for a magazine of GQ's caliber...Regardless, if JA is so "powerful" why did Ryan continue posting Pizzagate nonsense (after a short break) on his channel and selling pizzagate merchandise on his site? If you were threatened by such a "powerful" foe, would you also do the same? Either he didn't take the threat (from a man he's accusing of murder) or the warning from the FBI seriously, or the "threat" and talks with the FBI were simply fabricated.>f this is all a stunt as you claim, then why hasn't Ryan been arrested after filing the false report?Because, short of a confession, it's virtually impossible to prove. The police aren't going to waste resources putting an investigator on a fruitless effort. It was a pretty low risk move. A move that he didn't make until *hours after* he recorded, edited, and uploaded his youtube video (almost as if he wasn't going to report it until people started asking for evidence). We also don't know exactly what he told the police.But, again, forgetting that, if he was really threatened and reported those threats to the police, why didn't he ever record *any* of these interactions? Not just JA, but he could have called back the police and recorded himself asking questions or giving details/evidence about his report. He could have recorded the FBI telling him not to "poke the bear" (a point which you completely ignore). If any of his claims were true, he's had ample time to prove them. But, let's be real here. If *you* were threatened by a "powerful" man that you are accusing of *murder* and the fucking *FBI* told you to back off, would you continue hocking PG merch and vlogging about it?

Just look at his Instagram...http://themillenniumreport.com/2016/12/pizzagate-comet-pizza-owner-james-alefantis-posted-hundreds-of-suspicious-instagram-pictures-like-these/

There is no sex trafficking, child or otherwise, in the United States?? You can't be serious.

https://m.imgur.com/a/PiLKEI'm a bit skeptical of your intentions, and your apparent lack of information as to what happened between Ryan and James.Ryan filed an actual police report and James was confronted by law enforcement. This actually happened dude. I see people smearing Ryan all the time, probably out of desperation to cover up that loose end. Alefantis threatening an actual online researcher is a very damning piece of evidence.

> The Facebook chat was faked. > The guy that started the rumour runs www.pizzagategear.com and is trying to make money off it. This sounds like more of an opinion of yours, than fact. Do you have any actual evidence to support this claim? I understand Ryan runs Pizzagategear.com, I've spoken with him on a few occasions, but he stands by his story. You're saying he fabricated this entire event, as a charade to sell more shirts? Last I spoke to him, he never mentioned anything about being in trouble for filing a false police report. The phone records likely show a conversation between the two, as well, and law enforcement likely confirmed this.Did Ryan confess to faking the IM conversation, or is that just your "nothing to see here, move along" "Jedi wave" attempt to deter others from taking this piece of evidence legitimately?Thanks for posting the police reports also. To provide context to readers, this entire thing started after Ryan shared the "Pegasus Museum" video on Voat.co/v/pizzagatehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT9QzmMAe4

IF it's really her.

> There is no evidence of a satanic pedo ring which is why the courts found no evidence of it.ahahahahahahaha

I know, right! That was one of the things that made me realise there's actually something real fucky with it all. At first I was just thinking that it was a money laundering operation... But that's only part of it. Why would anyone launder money unless they were selling something illegal. But "drugs" just didn't fit the bill. 

That's the kind of red pill we want to see at the top of this thread, not a debunk. The debunks are fine, just not as the authoritative *top comment* for an entire round table discussion. You do know how top comments can be authoritative right?

I dont want to say too much here but some searching you should be able to find it

I just read an article today in Time magazine about how the Dept who monitors taken immigrant children is missing 1475 out of 1500 who were taken from their families. This is a result of the Health and Human Service Dept. rolling back funding for this program 2 years ago. What's worse is that many believe these children have fallen into human trafficking.here's the articlehttp://time.com/5256734/government-missing-migrant-children/

Apparently Mar-a-lago has confirmed Epstein is barred. Found the quote from "Filthy Rich" by James Patterson:>That arrangement ended when a (Mar-a-Lago) member‚Äôs young daughter complained to her wealthy father: while relaxing at Mar-a-Lago, she‚Äôd been approached and invited out to Epstein‚Äôs house. ‚ÄúThe girl said that she had gone and that Epstein had tried to get her to undress. ‚ÄúThe girl‚Äôs father had gone directly to Trump, who ‚Äî in no uncertain terms ‚Äî told Epstein that he was barred from Mar-a-Lago.‚Äù

The leader of the RNC chopped off part of her last name for Emperor Trump.The speaker of the house refuses to do anything without the express approval of papa trump.  Mitch McConnnel?  HAH!  You let me know who in the republican party leadership is standing up to Trump.  That ship is being run by Trumpists through-and-through.  The voices against Trump are marginalized, and not even running for reelection.  

 Isn't it weird that Bush also had a large role in convicting an innocent man in the case of the Atlanta Child Murders?The man convicted said he had been set up, and had been recruited by the CIA which Bush had previously been the head of. 

"Call boys" are adult male prostitutes. Don't get hung up on the word "boy". In the gay community (though it's not exclusive to us), we often use the word "boy" to describe adults, usually under 25. Similar to how "Call girls" in the straight world refers to adult female prostitutes. Or do you think "Girls Gone Wild" is a series of pedo flics?Other examples:The Backstreet Boys contained only adults.[This song](https://youtu.be/jBmkCoiHC2c) is not about a child custody case.Your argument apparently hinges on you not understanding the meaning of a term.

There were leaks in the Manhattan project. Not to mention spies.  Not to mention the difference between keeping a secret in 1945 and in 2018.

No it isn't. It predates the discovery of the FBI paper, back when Podesta/Comet were first leaked.

Maybe if every single pedo thread wasn't propaganda and lies I wouldn't have to ask people to stop posting BS without backing up. You're so mad. Just come up something that isn't partisan hackery and you won't feel so easily "derailed." Derailed is just code for "not joined with a circle jerk of unchecked agreement."

Ah. Another "genius" from TMOR. What's amusing, to me at least, is I'm not alt-right, nor a Trump supporter. On the contrary, I'm a democratic socialist and civil libertarian, if you were to label or approximate my political leanings. As for Trump, I consider him a fraud, a charlatan, a troll, and puppet, a puppet of Wall Street, Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Ag, the global elite, and the very "deep state" or military-industrial complex he selectively pretends to be at odds with for the sake of political theater and foremost political gain.

Yeah, I think it's the dark triad, which is both. Psychopaths are often narcissistic, but narcissists may not be psychopathic, which is why I made the distinction. But we're on the same page.

Alefantis is a creep though. No debating that. Dudes IG page was rough

Did you not SEE the art work on the walls.. Seriously.. wake up.

I agree about comet, but Podesta was almost certainly speaking in some sort of code.

I didn't say they did. I'm saying that the MSM cherry picked information from across the broad spectrum of theories that fall under "pizzagate" to erect a straw man which they could "debunk" for the cameras, despite not actually addressing the vast majority of information available which lead pizzagate theorists to their respective conclusions.

Ah mate! I remember on the subreddit the day before the "shooting" that guy from DC who posted about the traffic camera facing the other way, and then the next day - what do ya know! A shooting occurs. To everyone who saw that post beforehand the false flag was obvious. And like you mentioned, he only shot one bullet and it went straight into the computer tower (note: just in the interest of being specific, we don't actually *know* that it hit the hard drive. It was reported that it hit the computer tower in the back office, but what specific components got hit was never made public). 

The traffic camera never pointed at Comet Ping Pong in the first place, it pointed at the intersection, so it's irrelevant that it may have been off position. [Welch fired several shots in the pizzeria](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3237677/Welch-Edgar-Federal-Complaint-Dec-2016.pdf), and calling him an actor is a stretch ‚Äì he played "raver/victim" in one trashy film (ie, he was an extra, not an actor).

My name isn't an anagram of James Alefantis. Enfant has 2 n's. 

My name isn't an anagram of James Alefantis. Enfant has 2 n's. 

My name isn't an anagram of James Alefantis. Enfant has 2 n's. 

I know about Tony Podestas art. How does it make him a pedophile?How does Tony owning art which he displays in his home indicate James Alefantis is part of a child abuse ring? 

And this is why you don‚Äôt get taken seriously. 

Why does Podesta have to explain Susan Sandlers choice of words?I suggest the email isn't bizarre. Replace handkerchief with mobile phone or keyring for example. 

Is the realtor a pedophile?What does "pizza map" mean when it's decoded? 

[removed]

I know I just think mods shouldn't be calling out users that way.  It just adds to the noise already present for people like me who get called a shill constantly because we don't toe the line.

I look at most threads too. 

It's a discussion. There should be representation from multiple sides of the topic.Keep the topic on the content and not the faces please. As not to be a complete hypocrite, my comment to JLE was sincere though I could have worded it differently.

lol yup this string has just turned into a clever forum slide

Thanks. Ok, the first one :>James calls his friend (holding a baby) a chicken hawk. >https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6vdn22/the_nambla_chicken_hawk_expos%C3%A8_alefantis_chicken/Is wrong.James doesn't call anyone a chicken hawk. He uses the hashtag chickenlovers as a comment on a public Instagram post. To me it suggests both of them love chicken and [the baby may even be chewing on a piece in the photo.](https://www.counter-currents.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Chickenlovers.png)How does a photo of a friend holding a baby with the hashtag "chickenlovers" indicate the activity of a pedophile and why would a pedophile post their pedophile proclivities in public? 

Lock him away boys, he's weird that's all the evidence we need.Victims? Nah don't need any! 

Well this IS the right thread for it so go ahead. Pick one and we'll see how quickly I can make a fool of myself.QIEK EEDITZ: Although understand that saying *"These pictures are weird"* isn't something that can be disproved. You'd need to show how weird pics prove human sex trafficking. 

What proof do you have to present? 

Yeah, just google 'pizza handkerchief' and you'll find tons of examples of literally pizza\-themed hankerchiefs. Seeing as John is such a fan of italian cuisine, it would make sense that he had a pizza handkerchiefThose 'coded' e\-mails are the weakest part of the pizzagate 'evidence'. IMO we all do ourselves a disservice when we hold up easily\-defeated 'code' words as the biggest evidence of something sinister, when there's more questionable things that never get brought up.

I just want to know what it means. It's obviously not literal. However, there have been several theories about what is meant by map. I don't know. By the way, you are arguing with a false dichotomy, which is a type of strawman argument. This person can be both a real estate agent and complicit in illicit activity without being a ringleader of anything.

You'd ask John cause he would be expected to know it.Also, you have a suspiciously consistent number of upvotes on your comments. 

 

won't be. clear evidence of brigading

What exactly happened? There was really a troll comment with 100+ upvotes before this thread got put into contest mode? What did they say?

Your contention was hes not being impartial im tellin you hes not like that also this isnt court. 

Special agent? The police report says it was a police patrol officer called H. A. Schirard.

This is what I've been trying to tell them, you and I have spoke before. You may want to paste this comment in the other threads on this topic where I brought you up. Thanks for clarifying. 

You're full of shit.Are you proud of who you have become? I would be fucking embarrassed and ashamed. 

Right I brought up his creepy deleted instagram posts (aka adverts)

They renamed prostitution "sex trafficking" so in that sense it does exist, but there are no "sex slaves" in the U.S.

I also tried to follow the link in that image and there is nothing there.Edit: Never mind, searched by case number and found it. Still no information aside from the complaintant, and he didnt even sign it which seems odd.

Look dude, just because somebody points something out you dont like doesnt mean they have an "agenda". Get a grip.Anyway, i dont get what that picture is supposed to show. Alefantis' name is nowhere on it, all it shows is that this Ryan guy complained to the police about somebody making terroristic threats. Is there anything that actually shows that police confronted Alefantis about the supposed text message conversation?

Read the chat. It's clearly bullshit.Why doesn't Ryan sue Alefantis if this really happened? Why does the police report make no mention of Alefantis?The voat stuff is likely will craddock of Disobedient Media selling more bullshit. I don't know if they work in concert or just happen to be in parallel. 

>Are you blind or dumd? Uhh...Saville didn't have dungeons, he had a caravan. 

Why would you not want to see a debunk at the top of a round table discussion? Do you just want to speculate wildly with no regard for alternate viewpoints?

I don't agree with the removal of your comment, and not entirely with the comment itself either. Regardless, your comment appears to have been re-approved since. Though it's worth noting, if all or the majority your posts to a given forum or subreddit are entirely or nearly entirely in opposition of said forum or subreddit, it shouldn't be surprising you would receive greater scrutiny as a result. I'm not saying that's right, just the way nearly every forum and sub operates, more or less. I try to be as impartial as humanly possible, personally, when I moderate, and understand that's not as easy for most others to do instinctually. Perhaps the worst examples of biased moderation are /r/worldnews, /r/politics, and /r/The_Donald, where users are routinely banned without reason simply for having an unpopular opinion, or because the mods personally disagree with the user's point of view, in spite of no rule violation being present.

I think it's more so factthat we don't really need the top comment in a thread (especially a stickied round table thread) to be a debunk of some kind. I don't mind the debunks and if it's about what I think it is then you're probably right, but the problem is when your debunk shoots to the top (seems fishy, mostly TMOR would up vote something like this for trolling/brigading purposes) and makes the rest of the thread less attractive by nature. It's called forum sliding, whether intentional or not. Maybe just repost the debunk now that it's not going to be the top comment.

To me it looked like you had that comment ready to go for this thread or whenever someone asked about PizzaGate. You've copy-pasted before and it seems unnecessary. Copy-pasting comments as a reply to a comment or thread makes what you have to say look less genuine.

You come here in bad faith. You poison threads. You interfere with people's ability to learn and decide for themselves. I'm sick to death of banning all you and your buddies' sock puppets. I want you to leave of your own accord. You don't contribute. You poison. Think about it. 

Lol I've seen the videos, and they ARE gross...he said there was something scary about posting them...I assumed he meant dealing with shills, but that's not that scary to me.  Eat shit

So you're saying that budget constraints caused them to lose 98% of children taken from their families?

Fuck which president did it man. This 2 party system is the biggest smoke screen hindering us from banning together against our oppressive govt. 

Are there any contemporary accounts of the incident? I couldn't find anything other than third-hand accounts after Epstein was already in trouble. James Patterson wrote this like a decade after Epstein's accusers went public and he doesn't cite any sources. The closest I could find was this [article](https://pagesix.com/2007/10/15/sex-case-victims-lining-up/) written when Epstein was already in some deep shit and it doesn't mention Trump at all (Epstein denied it, by the way).Regardless, I'm not sure how much this account, if true, helps Trump. It means he was good friends with the guy for decades before another "wealthy" man made a big deal about. Sounds more like Epstein simply picked the wrong girl. The worst is they didn't even file a complaint with any authorities. Doesn't exactly make Trump look like the good guy here.I can't say this story is fabricated, but I think it's fair to say that had this information been about Podesta, pizzagate proponents would probably not brush it off as readily.

So Trump knew Epstein for 15+ years and partied with Epstein and knew that Epstein fucked younger girls but was totally oblivious to them being <18? Sorry Charlie, but that doesn't pass the smell test.Oh and then there's [this](https://vimeo.com/176181706) of course.

They tried until they received public backlash.  Obama care? Tax cuts? The wall?  They thought America voted in the Republican party. They got on their high horse which the public quickly bucked them off.  We voted Trump. Republican party is just a usefull tool at this point and they know it. 

Not that weird.  The Kelly girls thing is so sick.  Trying to get a copy of one autobiography of a woman who was victim to Bob Hope and loaned out to Kissinger and Bush she says.  Nightmares reading such things but we owe her courage as many witnesses as we can.I also got Moira Greyland's new book.  So horrid to see the Sci fi/fantasy authors of the 80s and 90s had such an evil rot within and a "feminist" author abusing her daughter and children.  Sick sick sick

> the Backstreet Boys contained only adults.That is completely untrue. The youngest member was 13, the oldest 22. 

*WHO* is lying? 

They connect themselves. It's just being objective to describe a repeating natural pattern.

Works fine for me. It just takes a long time to load.

Do you have links to the original report? 

Did you wait a week to make this comment? 

I think you may have hit the wrong target here 

Thanks for the link but that doesn't prove the ages you claimed.The statute is "18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1591 - Sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion"This statute covers sex trafficking of children AND adults.Mack has been charged under the clause which may or may not include children as I'm reading it. Do you have any articles which describes the ages of Jane Doe 1 & 2? Particularly the one which describes them as 12 year olds? 

I don't understand why citing that fact gets downvotes every time. It's the strangest thing.

Gotcha. Makes sense.

You‚Äôve not seen much avent grade art have you.

Where did Podesta use the code? 

100% he was talking in code but why is the code about children.

Yes, that is how they do it, it is on the FBI website for codes. The artwork and designs are notifications of what they are selling.

He's not going to reply lol

You are correct. We were "told" that's where the bullet hit....which is still kinda sloppy. But shills will say "OMG HE COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE!" yeah so could the shitty driver I was behind earlier this morning. 

Okay, think advertising for something illegal. You want to get the word out and your IQ is over 115. You still want to look like a great citizen who is just smart? On top of that, Art Museums get HUGE tax relief and it is easy for money laundering AND it is used to advertise they're specific fetishes, while making YOU The unaware feel like you don't understand specific tastes and undermine your inability to understand the psychopathic mind.

Because he has been widely implicated in a political pedophile/trafficking ring and accused of using pedophile codewords. If you were accused of such a thing and could easily explain yourself, why wouldn't you?If you replaced handkerchief with keyring or mobile phone it would still be strange.Who emails someone to tell them they left a hanky behind and do they want it returned? What is a pizza related map and why was it on the handkerchief? Why is this mentioned in the email as if it is significant?

I've no idea if the realtor is a pedophile. You asked where the email came from and I answered.

Did they claim he was a shill or did they merely point out the unusual account activity that is common with forum manipulators that get pings when certain keywords are used?Are you now claiming that shills don‚Äôt exist at all? 

Removed rule 10 on the sub.

I said I was being sincere. I think my comments reflect that.I think he provides uniquely detailed responses and they should be considerations in this thread.

 

I'm all for having 2 sidesIt does get tiring when one side refuses to look at evidence themselves and just go back to "it's debunked" or "it's crazy"These people should fuck right off the sub imo as they are not contributing a meaningful end of the discussionAnd my comment wasn't directed at JLE at all lol, more in a general sense in reply to bignuke

Would you care to expand on that?

Does nobody here remember the monologue from Heavy Breathing in the CPP "back area" for the excited crowd in which someone yell "He likes little boys!" And the HB MC replies sinisterly, " well we all have our preferences...heh heh heh" You bitches want to act like everything was pulled out an ass and construed. They took down Alefantes' Instagram for a reason - IT WAS DISGUSTING and nearly every post andComment was questionable. If it wasn't don't you think he would have left it up as proof of his innocent and family oriented restaurant purity? Not sure if you people can still pull up a complete archived version of the CPP/Alefantis Instagram - probably not. But if you never saw it in the first place I'm not sure how you can argue with me in ignorance.

[https://www.definition\-of.com/chicken\+lover](https://www.definition-of.com/chicken+lover)

not sayin lockin him away just yet. Just saying don't write it off as nothing  if you can read the writing on the walls, this guy is a criminal.   

You're the one who made the claim that pizzagate is complete fiction and now you want me to do the legwork for you in building and structuring your argument. Hard pass.I'm not saying pizzagate is confirmed real. I am very aware that the evidence for it is all circumstantial. Saying "there are other explanations for this or that" is all fine and good, and imo necessary, but it is not *disproving* something. Political figures around the world have been involved in human trafficking/pedophile rings before, and been involved in the coverups. I don't understand why the mere idea that there might be a pedophile ring in the US involving some politicians is so outrageous to some people.

See the thing is when a case like that is settled in court or outside of court, there is usually a clause which seals the evidence. You know how it works.Was Dylan sexually assaulted by James in the Comet Pizza kitchen? I will possibly never know unless I ask Carole or Dylan in person. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. Events seem to suggest that something did happen, like Carole leaving behind both restaurants she made popular (Bucks and Comet) due to "pressing family matters".Some researchers have got very close to the kind of smoking gun evidence that would make you happy, why not continue where they left off? Just imagine, you could debunk this once and for all and be a hero!https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1580540

Like Tony Podesta's friendship with known pedo Dennis Hastert, and the tube they spent together in a part of Japan known for underage relations. 

I think it's just literal.I didn't mean to set up a straw man, I'm trying to find out the logic that goes from real estate agent finding a handkerchief, that handkerchief being described to John by Susan, John replying it's not a big deal and Susan replying ok thanks - is a sign of a pedophile network talking in code. 

16 vs 13 is consistent? That's just the 2 above this one.Anyway, why does John have to explain Susan's choice of words?He said "it's mine but not worth worrying about" what do you suppose he meant? 

Just read through that, didn‚Äôt really debunk anything just tried to make it seem like a coincidence. There‚Äôs a plethora of bizarre emails that super elites were sending to each other regarding ‚Äúpizza‚Äù ‚Äúwalnut sauce‚Äù ‚Äúred daisy‚Äù that just don‚Äôt make sense for high value people to be emailing about. Or that Obama ordered $65,000 worth of hot dogs to the White House. It just doesn‚Äôt add up. People don‚Äôt like pizza THAT much. A normal presidential food security check comes out to be around $2,000 for radiation and poison scanning. The value of a Child from a third world nation on the silkroad, which would‚Äôve been active around the time of the emails, was in the range of $40,000-$120,000. NO ONE buys $50,000 Pizza‚Äôs and NO toxin checkpoint costs $65,000+.

It had 21 upvotes as you can see on removeddit.com 

You're "telling" me "he's not like that," which shows me that you think I'll trust anyone based on your word.  That's the essence of how propaganda works.

My bad, but the link gives some more credibility to your statement to the deniers. I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could view those posts without feeling a little sick. 

Have you missed this recent case?http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5649485/Nxivm-founder-Keith-Raniere-accused-sleeping-girls-15-12-Allison-Mack-wants-plea-deal.htmlAnd are you honestly saying that adults and children aren't ever literally *forced* into "prostitution"? 

>  Is there anything that actually shows that police confronted Alefantis about the supposed text message conversation?There definitely isn't any evidence:* His only proof was screenshots.* He claimed he ["tried"](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rhyrl/i_am_the_owner_of_pizzagategearcom_and_the_guy/dd7eysq/) to record their conversations *twice*. One of the times he had a "buddy" next to him and neither of them thought to at least video-record the conversation. The next time, Alefantis gives him a warning before the supposed call, but Ryan still doesn't record the conversation (despite having allegedly been threatened before).* He claimed to have reported Alefantis to the FBI and that they told him not to ["poke the bear"](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rhyrl/i_am_the_owner_of_pizzagategearcom_and_the_guy/dd7dycw/?context=3). Yet, he continued to [talk about PG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcppgo_Slk-_BeGVZtyqONw) and [selling pizzagate merchandise](http://web.archive.org/web/*/pizzagategear.com) for like a year afterwards. * If the FBI really looked into it, why haven't they found anything? Why didn't he ever provide evidence of the report? * If the FBI is "in on it" and/or he were really threatened by Alefantis, why would he continue to sell pizzagate merchandise and vlogging about pizzagate?      It doesn't look like he took the threat very seriously.

So nothing short of a confession from James himself, can convince you that Ryan is telling the truth? Why would he file a fake police report?If he's faking this thing, then James could sue him for slander or fabrication, correct? Then why hasn't he? My guess is because Ryan's story is true, and that James doesn't want this incident \*anywhere\* near a courtroom, especially with the circumstantial evidence against him in PG circulating.Would a full written elaboration on the incident help? My job isn't to convince you, but I hope you can see there's clearly something strange going on here.[https://wearechange.org/james\-alefantis\-threatens\-pizzagate\-researcher\-ryan\-oneal/](https://wearechange.org/james-alefantis-threatens-pizzagate-researcher-ryan-oneal/)Thanks for providing me with the opportunity to present this piece of the puzzle to the readers.

> It's clearly bullshit.No, it isn't, and everything points to Ryan's story being true. I understand you are passionate about discrediting the Pizzagate scandal, but it's going to take more than just your opinion to "debunk" this. 

Didn't I just explain that? Top comment is the representative for the entire thread. It's just the way Reddit works because it's a linear forum. We don't need a debunk representing the entire thread, it doesn't make sense and doesn't promote discussion or debate.I actually agree with the debunk, but I don't think it should be the top comment because it creates a false consensus that "this conversation is over" or "everyone thinks this is BS so I shouldn't read further", when in fact it is a complex topic with several avenues of discussion and tons of loose ends still.And because TMOR is behind the up voting on it, and also stirring up drama to distract from the conversation, their activities in this sub should be nullified by any means. They are deliberately trying to make conspiracy research look misguided and irresponsible.

The sidebar says this sub is for discussion. Presenting an argument and debunking it are both part of a discussion. That's why even mods here spend time/energy debunking conspiracy theories (e.g. Russia-Trump related ones).

His comment was removed for spam, not forum sliding/brigading. So according to the mods, posting the full extent of the Podesta emails is now spam. Make of that what you will.

My comment itself was relevant to PizzaGate, I used the Podesta emails to show how the ‚Äúdominoes on pasta‚Äù email makes sense with context. It‚Äôs relevant to the topic at hand, yeah? I‚Äôd posted it before, but I posted it here because I thought it would add to the discussion. It‚Äôs a collection of primary sources, it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs anything to rephrase. I wasn‚Äôt really trying to ‚Äúsay anything‚Äù with my own voice, per se, I just compiled some of the emails to tell their own story

Wow, really?Podesta(Pizzagate) is in the title, how does posting his emails in full not contribute? If I honestly don't believe Podesta rapes kids am I not allowed to discuss?

Rich people know reporting each other to the authorities doesn't do anything. Getting wrongdoers or "wrongdoers" into the news, now, that's different.

BTW in Mitch McConnel's first meeting with Trump he said I don't want to hear anymore talk of draining the swamp.  Mitch will be going done, just like Ryan. Either by his own hand or ours. 

I'm not sure what the "original report" would be, let alone where to find it. I think the guy I linked was replying to someone who uploaded some documents or something. Or you can submit a FOIA request, like they did. But I'm not sure what a report like this would say. I don't think there's much meaningful information that can be recorded (other than the allegations) when there's no witnesses of a crime (or victims).Generally speaking, police investigate crimes, not people. It can get really murky, civil rights-wise, if police go around shaking people down for little/no reason. Without evidence of a crime, like a witness or a crime scene to pin on a suspect, there's not much for them to go on.I've suggested in the past that pizzagaters hire a personal investigator, but I've never seen anything come of it. However, after researching the evidence/accusations myself, I'm not even sure any investigator would take the job (since I don't think the clients would be too happy with the results). The "evidence" Pizzagaters are going on basically boils down to accusations and speculation, mixed in with a hefty dose of lies/misleading information. And anybody who disagrees with them opens themselves up to personally targeted attacks, which I see happen all the time.

You know after reading your comment again, and your comment history, I think you're right. My apologies.

You two are so confused you got into an argument with each other. Now kiss, weirdos. 

Yes sure lemme just mind read the judge and see who they are

because it's continually brought up after certain users make unfounded claims about the victims' ages of Allison Mack, who is not Raniere. It muddies the waters. Hope that answers your question, as it's not strange to down vote incorrect content based on context. It's sane even.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERZqkUqw-xg

*avant-garde...

Yeah because pedophiliac "art" is so fucking cool . Sad that you defend these disgusting people.  

[removed]

The email leaks, like "pizza-related map".

I know it's not conclusive, but you sometimes gotta trust your instincts. Literally the first time I saw a picture of John Podesta the first thought that popped in my head was "looks like a pedophile"

Perhaps it isn't, but some of the things he said do appear to be pre-existing pedo code.

> it is on the FBI website for codesThe symbols are from the FBI. The codewords did *not* come from the FBI, but instead came from 4chan which isn't reliable. 

Wonder why? He already used up his canned anti\-PG talking point. 

That's fine, he doesn't have to. I think I articulated my point as clearly as I could. And getting the information out there is all that matters. 

Why do they "want to get the word out"? You've already said they're all emailing and Instagraming each other. It just doesn't make sense. 

But as you just said Podesta didn't use the alleged code, it was Susan.>Because he has been widely implicated in a political pedophile/trafficking ring and accused of using pedophile codewords. So where is the evidence he has to answer? If there is evidence of a crime he should absolutely be held accountable >If you were accused of such a thing and could easily explain yourself, why wouldn't you?Because acknowledging such ridiculous claims can only be damaging. >If you replaced handkerchief with keyring or mobile phone it would still be strange.I don't agree. >Who emails someone to tell them they left a hanky behind and do they want it returned? What is a pizza related map and why was it on the handkerchief? Why is this mentioned in the email as if it is significant?As you said Susan Sandler emailed him to tell him about the handkerchief. Although actually it was Kathryn Tate the realtor who first mentioned the handkerchief. Because she is in the business of selling homes and wants to return property to people viewing her homes for sale - like a professional.If we assume you are correct, what role do Kathryn Tate and Susan Sandler play? Why are they sending plain text emails about pillows and kitchen islands and real estate mixed with pedophile code? 

I'm just trying to highlight how flimsy the alleged code theory is - It wasn't written by Podesta.We don't know if the person who wrote it is a pedophile.We don't know if it's encoded.These points alone are enough to cast doubt on the entire theory imo.And thank you for replying, I don't mean to be combative. 

I find the worst shills are the silly folks that hide in private subreddits debating whether other users are shills to the point that they dig up information on those folks then cutely refer to it later when they come out of their little private enclave and think they discovered some big revelation and giddily throw it around like they're in 3rd grade show and tell.Those folks are actually the biggest hypocrites too.

I missed that sorry.  I appreciate that.  FTR I think you folks do a good job modding overall, I just wish this sub could get over the idea that folks that don't agree with them are shills.

I don't comment on many threads, though I read many threads. There are a few topics I have dug into over the years that I do comment on. Probably because those are topics I imagine I know a little about. I suspect JaimeLesEnfants behaves similarly. So, not terribly weird at all. Just human nature.

As I mentioned in another comment, this thread isn't going to change anyone's mind so folks should just rehash the data, stay civil and agree to disagree.

From my perspective, the exact same thing could be said for the other side as well. Do you find that tiring as well? Personally, as long as one side keeps rehashing the same points, I am all for the other side providing the same rebuttals. But that is just me.

my statement stands on its own. So not really. edit: when sharks sense chum in the water they feed meaning any forum slide opportunity sensed by a potential troll could be easily taken advantage of here.

Huh... Guess he doesn't want to debunk it so much as argue with everyone

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11508"Might be time for Denny to vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island"Podesta hasn't talked about this email or the torture chamber email once.

That's just a run of the mill cult and is not pedo related in any way.

Don't know if you saw my comment but I found the police report and full Facebook chat. 

> If he's faking this thing, than James could sue him for slander or fabrication, correct?Anybody can sue anybody for anything. That doesn't mean they would win. He would have to prove that not only was Ryan lying, but also that JA was hurt by those lies. Not an easy thing to do.All Ryan would have to say is: "I thought it was him, although it could have been a troll." There would be virtually no way to win this kind of case (I challenge you to find a successful similar case of slander/libel). No lawyer would encourage such a waste of resources.Not to mention that a lot of people are aware of ["The Streisand Effect"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) and would rather avoid drawing attention to a case they probably couldn't win.Regardless, Ryan's story simply doesn't add up:https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8gqit5/rconspiracy_round_table_13_pizzapedogate_and/dygeprd/

Was Alefantis ever actually charged with anything? Is there any evidence at all that police ever approached him about the complaint? Is there a court date pending? Did Ryan drop the charges? What's the resolution to this and how does it prove Ryan's accusation?Also, the reason as to "why" he would make it up is obvious; is/was his YouTube channel monitized or not? Also, what would Alefantis have to gain by suing for libel aside from people like you just seeing that as more "evidence" of trying to cover something up?

I'd love to see some evidence pizzagate was real, there just isn't any.I won't be silenced for disagreeing with you, and others. 

You're just interpreting things incorrectly. Forum sliding can be considered spam. I'm not even suggesting that was his intent, but it is what happened, so it should be cleaned up to promote discussion. Otherwise half the people will jump into this thread, see the top comment is a debunk, and become disinterested in the rest of the thread.

It doesn't make sense because it's code. 

The stats are in! No post history here in 5 months....hmmmHow long do we ignore what is going on?Real users of this sub...are you sick of this?

No, by all means, dispute the info. All Joey does though, is very carefully shit on all conspiracy topics. With *miraculous* amounts of votes taking him right to the top. It is synthetic consensus. I actually think it is dangerous for me to poke someone like him this hard. I have probably banned 5 or 10 of his alts(conservative estimate) over the last couple years. I'm actually tagging you right now to track on if you are one of his sock puppets. No offense. Just some unknown account poking a mod when he is so obviously out of fucks doesn't make a ton of sense.I'm not at a PC, I can't really look, how many comments have you made in this sub before now?

From your lips to God's ears.  Lots of Congress needs to go.  Start with the 44ish Dems the #Awanbrothers traded Intel to Pakistan on/with and Ryan, Gowdy - first gotta remove his head stuck up Mueller's ass, Mitch McConnell etc etc.  I hate to be that person but God seems to have taken cars of Songbird McCain.Oh and the Dem who sent Pizzagate investigating Scalise's staff pizzas the day he got shot by Sanders loving child abuser sigh a " mean looking assault weapon".  I need to remember his name because that is one disgusting move

All good üëç

LOLLOLOL 

You claimed they were 12 a few minutes ago. 

There is nothing incorrect about factand Reneir is also indited on the same case. Him sleeping with children in the past is definitely a correlation worth mentioning.

Yeh I‚Äôm at work, should of checked that before posting haha you get my point though

Podesta didn't use those words at all, it was a woman called Susan.https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795What do you think she means? Why does her use of "pizza related" indicate Podesta is a pedophile?What do you make of this part of the email>Here are links to the houses we drove by today located in Vineyard Haven. >1 House at the end of the road to Lake Tashmoo at Kuffie's Point...>Thanks for all piling into the car. It definitely was more fun with everyone and think of all the gossip you would have missed if we were in two cars.> Let us know if you have any other questions about any of the houses.

This is accurate

You‚Äôre avoiding the question that paid forum manipulators exist, and are present on most conspiracy forums, as well as corporate shills who shill products on major social media platforms, including reddit. https://reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/Are you that ignorant or just trolling?

Hopefully someone will address the substance of my comment rather than debate around it and imply I'm a shill.As yet I have had no substantive replies! 

:thumbsup:

Gotcha, thanks.

Okay bruh bruh, I'm looking at your comment replies on this thread, and you've clearly got some sort of agenda here, so I won't bother arguing with someone that doesn't want to actually have a conversation or be convinced of anything.But, just to your reply: why do all of the #chickenlover tags have chickens in them? Why does James' only have a little kid and no chicken?OOOOOOOP! Maybe #chickenlover means different things to different people, huh?

actually he's probably completely clean now that i give him a closer look.  you right

More like NONCEsense, amiriteguiz?

He was friends with the guy and he was about to be tried for paying off abuse victims.Although the statement isn't a negative comment against Hastert it is hardly an endorsement of his behaviour in the 1970s.Regardless, how does a tongue in cheek commet about dissappearing make John a pedophile? John wasn't coaching the wrestling team with Hastert and once again it wasn't John who made the alleged incriminating comment. But the person who did wasn't Hillarys campaign manager so that's not worth mentioning is it? 

Start reading the emails, you‚Äôll find the same shit that I found. Or look into the JFK files and open your mind. Otherwise consider to shut people up or realize our world truly is run by sick sick elites.

Rule 10

How do you know this? The trial hasn't even begun.

 

I'd seen it before, but didn't really think it was relevant to my points. I have noted in my other comment though that the timestamp of the report proves he reported it after uploading his video.I guess vlogging on youtube is more important than threats from a man he's accusing of murder. Funny how nothing ever came of the report. His local PD must be in on it, too, and they're defending the child rapist thousands of miles away! /s

>I'd love to see some evidence pizzagate was realWhy? Most of us here wish this wasn't real. Unfortunately, there are a myriad of strange connections and a mountain of circumstantial evidence, that seems to paint a very dark picture of some sort of criminal activity. People here are just doing what they consider their duty, by being a part of the citizen investigation to expose those involved.\>I won't be silenced for disagreeing with you, and others.Of course not. That being said, a disagreement would be fine, but your highly motivated and systematic approach to "debunking" each piece of evidence brought up, may be seen as disingenuous and agenda driven by some of the users here. Especially given the nature and purpose of this sub.

Read the followup be the mods. He is literally being told everything he post is spam. If the mods deem what you post the be in bad faith, they can delete it as spam on a whim. everything.Also is reeks of gate keeping. Post anything arguing against the premise of the post, leave. >I would reevaluate my life, my goals, my duty as a human? That is what I would do if I were youGreat response from a mod right?

Jesus man, I just disagree with you. Why is that such a big deal? Also thank you for the awesome pm's I'm sure are coming my way after you decided I'm the problem with the sub.

1 - I talk about conspiracies, I can find examples if you don‚Äôt believe me. They may not be the same conspiracies that interest you but they‚Äôre conspiracies nonetheless2 - how is providing context or sources or counter arguments for something ‚Äúshitting on a conspiracy‚Äù?3 - I‚Äôve never had an alt account, much less an alt account banned.4 - What makes the upvotes I get ‚Äúmiraculous‚Äù or ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù? Why can‚Äôt it just be that people agree with me?5 - why did you dodge my question about the other post, with even more aggregated links, being allowed to stay up?

I dont know, around 5 I would guess. You can go through my history if you feel suspicious about me, its fine.Btw, if you truly believe he is avoiding bans and acting in bad faith, by all means keep banning him. I just feel from reading this thread you are in the wrong, thats all.

You people keep confusing yourselves. 

Don‚Äôt be such an asshole and ask for sources...what‚Äôs wrong with you. You like facts or somethin?

I'm not sure about the ages of the victims Mack recruited because of the ambiguity of the charges, but Keith Raniere has had serious accusations of pedophilia in the past:http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5649485/Nxivm-founder-Keith-Raniere-accused-sleeping-girls-15-12-Allison-Mack-wants-plea-deal.html

Have a good day bruh

User A - makes up ages of Allison Mack's victims (b/c there has been no announcement of the ages of her victims)User B - Points out the disinfoUser C - whataboutism User D - Points out user doesn't offer the ages of Allison Mack's victimsUser C - whataboutism tho

Most of the email seems innocent, what on earth would "I think it has a map that seems pizza-related"  mean?   There is a history of pizza being code for child porn. It does predate the emails as well. 

Rule 10

An idea with no evidence to corroborate it. 

Yes there are shills.  Better?Now address mine about the folks hiding in the conclave with moderators ganging up on real users because they disagree.  Are those shills?

In my opinion, one of the most compelling elements is [the hot tub reference](https://i.redd.it/e75kp2bdqnv01.jpg). As a grown ass adult, children in a hot tub would never be described as "entertainment".

I don't have an agenda I just know all of the pizzagate story, and none of it implies pedophillia. 

 

Removed. Rule 10.

 

You're username is an anagram for James Alefantis. Weird coincidence right?

Rule 10.

If they were involved in "child sex trafficking" then the media would be all over it, but since it's just some adult prostitutes nobody is interested.

I asked you 7 days ago to provide a link to prove your claim.  You did not provide one, so were you lying?

Please provide a link to a story about this.

It's simply beyond belief Ryan wouldn't have mentioned who was making these "terroristic threats" in the police report - I'm sure if Alefantis knew this was still ongoing he'd have a law suit on his hands. 

I could say you're highly motivated to attack these people with no evidence or criminal complaints. You don't have superiority here. 

There is no easy way to moderate a forum like this. It's a double edge sword because eventually you have to be the authority on something, basically the opposite of what we're trying to do here by getting others to think for themselves. Eventually the power structure running this sub becomes the very monster they were once fighting against. No easy way around that. But you've just gotta draw a line somewhere, or else the whole thing becomes a shit show.And I did offer a solution in my previous comment.I'm coming from a position of knowledge here. I saw the leaked conclave discussions where the mods were talking about who they think is problematic or spamming the sub. JoeyBulgaria was one of them. What I realized by reading through the conclave leak was that I was peering into the nature of humanity, and seeing how the mods of this sub are potentially becoming the monster they are so much against, how power eventually corrupts because enough people agree on something that the blame never falls on one person's shoulders.I do however support their move in getting rid of the forum slide "spam" by Joey. I said that I would not have a problem if he posted it here in the thread again, but it being the top comment basically derails this entire thread and that is a problem.

You should see my PMs lol. This shot is glorious!

Hahaha. You are a sock puppet.

Yeah cheese pizza can be used to mean child pornography and has been around for a long time.Now the email reads>The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems **pornography**-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you‚Äôre busy, so feel free not to respond if it‚Äôs not yours or you don‚Äôt want it.And that's your evidence that John Podesta is a pedophile - because a woman used the word pizza in an email sent to him about real estate and a lost handkerchief.John replies>It's mine, but not worth worrying about.https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433How does this reply implicate him as a child abuser? 

If that‚Äôs what you really think happens in the conclave, keep up your delusions. It‚Äôs hilarious to watch you get unhinged. Now you‚Äôre just trying to bait me into a rule 10. You seem very jealous you weren‚Äôt invited to the conclave. 

 

There was no reference to a hot tub. Personally I can see how children having fun can be described as entertainment, especially for the grandparents the email was distributed between.I saved the following comment which describes the event in more detail. >The party was an annual get together of friends who knew each other from having worked together as Congressional staffers. The [people invited](http://i.imgur.com/kKcwBDh.png) were men and women in their mid-50s, mostly married couples (except for the bottom row in that photo array). John Podesta and his wife were invited, but couldn't attend. I think Mary is actually the one who is friends with them because, the previous year, the invitation was sent to her email and she forwarded it to John because she was going to be out of the country.>In the email, she's letting the guests know that the pool is going to  be open and heated ‚Äîeven though the party was in October that year‚Äî so they'll bring their bathing suits. From the email:>> With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping>> up again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang‚Äôs visit to>> the farm in Lovettsville. And I thought I‚Äôd share a couple more notes:>> We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be>> Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and>> almost 7) so you‚Äôll have some further entertainment, and they will be in>> that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun,>> and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever>> attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so>> we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).>By the way, I don't know if you have ever played with kids in a swimming pool, but it is actually fun in a completely nonsexual way. They like to be thrown through the air and to stand on your shoulders and jump off and you can totally destroy them in a splash battle.>Mostly I've done it with my own kids but the last time we were at a church picnic at a lake, three boys were pretend-attacking me (one on each arm and one on my back) and I walked out where it was deep enough that they were all floating so I could toss them around. Then the one on my back climbed a little higher and I couldn't move and the water was right up to my mouth! Haha, suddenly I'm almost drowning! Since I didn't know how well they could swim, I didn't want to duck under the water to shake them off. Eventually I managed to take a step onto higher ground.https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/63jb0a/woah_did_anyone_see_this_8ch_post/dfuze7c

Just for the record, as a grown adult who has raised children, there were plenty of times over the years when my children were young that I referred to them as "entertainment" to our friends raising their own children. They are activity and bustle and occupy a lot of attention, hence "entertainment". So just one vote for, I don't see this as odd in the slightest.

Well, if you know the 'whole' pizzagate story, then I'm assuming you've gone over to the voat pizzagate and read about all the various rabbitholes they've uncovered. The issue with pizzagate isn't comet ping pong itself, it's a wider issue of political pedophilia and human trafficking via The Clinton Global Initiative. And all the players have this strange connection to Comet Ping Pong.ALSO: if you know the 'whole' story, please explain Heavy Breathing to me.

I have read the emails, I have found the specific ones where they cite ordering ‚Äúwalnut sauce‚Äù casually. Whatever the fuck that could mean. Your account seems to be here to discredit Truth seekers. Carry on

What is rule 10?

First sentence of the last paragraph. 

My name isn't an anagram of James Alefantis. Enfant has 2 n's.

Dude his name literally means I like kids in French, ignore the troll.

My comment is defending the subreddit against being called paranoid.Why didn't you give any warning to the one calling me paranoid?  HMMM.  INTERESTING.

Forcing people to participate in a sex cult by using blackmail *is sex slavery*. I'm not sure how you are calling this "prostitution".I'm concerned at how adamantly you argue that sex trafficking and sex slavery don't exist *at all*, much less child sex slavery and pedo-blackmail. 

Reddit = corporate censorship.  Alternatives: Voat.co, Saidit.net, Gab.aiDo yourself a favor and opt-out!Here's the app I'm using to edit my comments:https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuiteYou should too! 

Child trafficking was listed in the charges that came out.And no, it wouldn't be all over the media because they have been complicit in covering up their own anchors sex crimes, like Jimmy Saville at the BBC.

 

>I'm sure if Alefantis knew this was still ongoing he'd have a law suit on his hands.I'm not sure about that. I've mentioned that slander/libel lawsuits are pretty difficult to win. Even if he did give the police a name, his defense in a lawsuit could *easily* be "I thought it was JA, but I could have been wrong/trolled/whatever". How can anyone prove he was lying, rather than wrong?But even if he prove he lied, JA would still need to show that those videos, specifically, caused him some kind tangible harm, which is also fairly difficult.But let's say he did win the lawsuit, that would still do absolutely nothing, zilch, nada, in placating pizzagate believers.I think it's more likely JA doesn't want to feed the fire by launching a lawsuit that would only bring unwanted attention.

>  You don't have superiority here. Well, you saying it's "clearly bullshit" doesn't make your opinion superior in any way, and in fact shows that you can't PROVE it's bullshit, just state it baldly like it's fact when it isn't.  And if you say that zhanli is highly motivated in his attack, well duh.  These people are sick.  If something rubs the wrong way against human nature, people are gonna have a visceral reaction.  

There is a difference between Harsh/strong moderating and what I personally have seen in this thread. This is closer to a tantrum.Would you agree that it could have been handled better and clearer? Maybe we can agree on that at least.

Yeah I don't want you to get shitty PMs, so this doesn't really change my perspective of you blowing me up for no reason.You have a lot more sway with people in this sub than me, I never really post here. So it kind of felt like you are setting the dogs on me with that type of comment.

Dude, I just don't agree with your moderating in this thread. I don't know why this has to be a bigger deal than that.But I guess you know everything about me after like 10 minutes, I have a feeling nothing I say will change that.

>the kids might be under the age of ~~13~~ 99. I said might asshole. And Oprah references aren't relevant any longer>you might be part of the denialism that helps perpetuate this disgusting problem?there have been no verifiable ages of the parties Allison Mack abused. Or would you like to stop blowing smoke and start providing any verifiable proof of Allison Mack's victims. The showboating is just that - you're blowinghard with an agenda

I never said I thought he was a pedophile, only that the emails seemed to be code.

> If that‚Äôs what you really think happens in the conclave, keep up your delusions.I mean, it kind of looks like that's what's [going on there](https://ibb.co/fApBcx). It's possible that it's just a bad example that makes that subreddit look worse than it actually is. Like that thread is taken out of context of larger, more detailed discussions going on there in other threads. The problem is that "outsiders" have no way of knowing what's going on and what's being discussed. Making a private subreddit for only certain "chosen" users to be able to discuss this subreddit with the mods is basically asking for people to suspect that something nefarious is going on, even if it isn't.

[removed]

That's a great response. Thanks for sharing the counterpoint.I like the last paragraph the best. It totally doesn't make you sound creepy at all.

The issue is comet ping pong via the Podesta emails was the corner stone of early pizzagate investigations so to move the story to some tertiary 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon seems disingenuous. 

 

>Posts that attack this sub, users or mods thereof, will be removed. Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, depending on context. First violations will usually result in a warning but bans are at the mods' discretion.

 

It's a reference to a piece of pizzagate "evidence" ie a bar in Washington called l'enfant.https://i.imgur.com/CPdys3P.jpg

Yeah i saw that, thanks

I never called you anything i said based on your post structure you SEEM to be and thats my own opinion. Like for example hey buddy I know youre not normally a butthead but today you sure are acting like one :p make sense?  Dont worry i would never propagandize you its happened to me too many times but  sorry if you felt offended

I haven't seen the report in the queue.

[removed]

So you're sticking with "it's obviously true because there are no news stories or media reports"?

Where was "child trafficking" listed in the charges that came out?https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4421645-Keith-Raniere-Complaint.htmlI don't see anything about children or underage people, but maybe I missed it.

he has a point, don't go making claims then

Yeah, right.  I do not believe you or anything that you've said.

What people are sick? There's no evidence Podesta, Alefantis or anyone else named in the pizzagate allegations has abused a child.Yes child abuse is sick but that's no excuse to attack people based on their friends co workers instagram posts. 

I added more to my comment above.I'd say they handled it alright, but could have been a bit more clear.People just need to know this sub is under fire constantly by mischief makers. It's nearly impossible to sort the good intentions from the bad intentions sometimes. So a line just has to be drawn. Joey will survive, everything will be OK. He should just repost his comment like I said.Also to be honest, I have problems with some of the mods here but I don't allow that to get in my way. My mission is much larger than a squabble with some moderator on some forum on the internet.

Comments like this give me hope.

[removed]

Ok. I don't think any of the emails are encoded. 

>	The problem is that "outsiders" have no way of knowing what's going on and what's being discussed. Making a private subreddit for only certain "chosen" users to be able to discuss this subreddit with the mods is basically asking for people to suspect that something nefarious is going on, even if it isn't.The ‚Äùchosen‚Äù users are users who have been active in conspiracy for a long time, and participate. Since the election, there has been a huge influx of users who come here to forum slide and manipulate comment sections. Coincidencently, the only conspiracy they will claim exists is Trump Russia collusion, which has been pushed by the mainstream, project mockingbird media  In particular, /r/TopMindsOfReddit is where many of these users come from. Rule 13 and the 2 month account rule was made to combat the brigades and forum sliding. They will stalk users, and have attempted to dox them in the past. In case you are wondering why reddit admins allow the blatant site wide rule breaking, it is likely sanctioned as it has support from mainsteam media.https://i.imgur.com/GK7JMX3.jpghttps://www.reddit.com/user/wearetheopposition

 

 

Np, also ninja edited - there was no reference to a "hot tub" which immediately has more sexual connotations than "heating the pool" - an example of how important language and syntax is, particularly with pizzagate. 

What's up man, where's that explanation of Heavy Breathing? You know, Amanda Kleinman, on video made a joke about everyone 'having their preferences' after someone yelled out 'little kids' or something? How about sexstains too, while we're at it? The pedo triangle in their music videos? The two bands \(that are shitty bands, I should add\) that played all the time at Comet...you know what I'm talking about, right expert? What's up with that? You're an expert on this, right?Why did Alefatis' sister write a letter of support for a pedophile that molested a buncha girls? What's up with that? Hassert, Kloman...oh, how about George Nadar? Caught with a shit ton of child porn on him. Here's a pic of him with Tony & Bill Clinton: [https://steemit\-production\-imageproxy\-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/DQmTrM4QdbrvknusBvTx73THZCC8EEDEsE7NDWwRGTMWBdo](https://steemit-production-imageproxy-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/DQmTrM4QdbrvknusBvTx73THZCC8EEDEsE7NDWwRGTMWBdo)Man, these people sure are friends with a lot of convicted pedophiles! What's up with that? Again, I don't know any pedophiles....do you? But, oh wait, I forgot, there's nothing to pizzagate right? You're the expert...please explain this to me, oh wise one!Or, are you not gonna say shit because there is no explanation, and you fuckin knoooooow it.lil batch.

Nah, because everyone suspects the initial people named in pizzagate have something to do with the other stuff. factthat Tony & John were/are friends with a convicted pedophile (Hassert) deserves at least an explanation....how many pedophiles are you friends with? If I found out my friend was a pedophile, I would immediately cut ties with him, why didn't the Podestas?All those cats are NTBT, imo. At the very least, some of this shit should be explained. But that has never happened, the narrative has been reduced to 'oh, you think kids were trafficked in a pizza parlor? FAKE NEWS', without really explaining or offering up an explanation of all the circumstantial evidence that IS valid, or DOES deserve further examination.Also: awaiting your Heavy Breathing explanation. 

[removed]

You are just someone who is here to shit on those who seek the truth lol. Don‚Äôt like trump really never did but he is definitely doing things behind the scenes to stop the elite child PEDO rings. Hence ALLISON MACKInsider in on most of the elite events that happen in Hollywood. https://www.google.com/amp/s/pagesix.com/2018/05/04/smallville-star-allison-mack-appears-in-court/amp/

So did you warn the other guy too who called me a disinfo agent?

The acceptable thing is to address their arguments, civilly point out that their arguments are lacking, or downvote and move on; not to attack the user.

This isn't a court of law, and I don't have to argue evidence with you. But if you think people base this off just a "friends co-workers instagram posts" is EXTREMELY disingenuous.  How is Clinton's connection to Laura Silsby, a KNOWN child trafficker, ZERO evidence?  HMMM???  Now, I could see past the Moloch comment by Clinton, IF she didn't have these nagging associations with scumbags.  

If nothing changed except the mods comments in this thread I would feel better. But they are just so antagonistic and aggressive, it comes across almost childish. Like it not healthy for the sub in the long run, I think.

Ok, good for you I guess?

[removed]

You don't think they are code? What could a pizza related map even be? Why would it be on a handkerchief? How can you read that sentence and not think it sounds very strange?

 

[removed]

I don't think some shitty hipster bands with weird videos are evidence of child abuse. If you do that's up to you. Regardless, how does a heavy breathing music video and factthat Podesta knows Hastert (who was abusing school boys in the 70s) indicate an active pedophile ring? George Nader is an interesting one, he was actually more recently an advisor to Donald Trump and is part of the Mueller investigationhttp://i2.wp.com/eaworldview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NADER-TRUMP.jpg?w=689  http://eaworldview.com/2018/03/how-saudi-arabia-and-uae-got-inside-trumps-white-house-and-the-mueller-investigation/And here's Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer having a cigar with a convicted child trafficker, Tevfik Arif a few weeks ago. https://mobile.twitter.com/elizlanders/status/984895132276273159

Got eeem

Are you OK? 

Removed. Rule 10

 

Yep; removed his comment as well.

Rule 10

Have you reported the comment? I don't read every comment in every thread. Today I have mostly worked off the report queue because I've been busy with real life. 

Clinton never made a Moloch comment, that was in an email to her again.Silsby served her time in Haitian jail, Clinton didn't get her off. 

Well what bothers me is that they make a rule against calling someone a shill, yet behind closed doors they are categorizing who they think are shills. Seems toxic in a way, but I don't really know what moderating a big sub like this entails.

Could it be something like...http://i.imgur.com/QkbP2Qx.jpgSeems more reasonable to assume Kathryn and Susan are talking about a novelty handkerchief than switching between talking about pillows and houses to child abuse in the same email chain. 

 

Bro, I went through your post history. You latch onto minutia, intentionally miss the point, don't respond to the actual point, and you derail.So, what, you're probably buddies with these guys or something, huh? I'm a super duper skeptical person (and quite articulate as well, as you can see), but even I know something's fucky here. If you don't, you're deliberately missing the point. Whatever man, I don't even care. Have fun posting on pizzagate threads trying to derail the conversation. Have fun with whatever you do in your free time.I've come to the conclusion people are absolute sheep and won't do anything to change their situation, no matter what kind of stuff is shoved in their faces, so I won't even deign to say some bullshit like, 'one day, we're gonna get your kind', because honestly, no one probably will.Must be nice.EDIT: and actually, just to respond to your point about shitty hipster bands (because I kind of enjoy dismantling your weak jousts). Still no response from you about the Amanda Kleinman remark. I grew up down the street from a prolific pedophile (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Parnell), and he literally had that pedo sign on his front door. He got arrested for trying to buy a baby from his nurse...seeing that symbol in light of these pizzagate allegations, I remembered that dude's door from my childhood. So, a band that has that blatant imagery in their videos, and they performed regularly at comet ping pong?The point is, all of these connections to pedophiles, these people rub elbows with pedophiles on the regular...that SHOULD be enough circumstantial evidence to investigate this further. You're obviously not able to explain them away. And yeah, Trump's people mess with child abusers too. Clinton and Trump are buddies with Jeffrey Epstein. It's both sides of the aisle.But you already know all this, I imagine. I'm mainly writing this as an exercise for myself.It's fun to shit on people that are wrong. I guess if this is a troll thing, you won.But I kinda won too, in a way.

Keep backing yourself into a corner lol. Largest darkweb sites seized. You probably like factthat children are abused. Hope you realize most people other than elites can‚Äôt afford the $100,000 price tags of ‚Äúlive humans‚Äù https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/business/dealbook/alphabay-dark-web-opioids.html

I've been called a sockpuppet  and the problem with the sub by mod in this thread. I've done nothing but disagree with his style of moderating. Rules absolute does not get applied to the mods or who the mods agree with.

Well, any one of these things is going to be able to be written off, but when they are all taken together, then you start to think, "maybe this isn't some innocuous message about an actual handkerchief. "

I don't see how discussing the details of the allegations can be considered derailing the thread. A thread specifically about the allegations.You may be articulate but it isn't me who is missing the point.You have started from the position that Podesta and Co are child abusers so you add all these little bits of not even worrying instagram posts and friends of friends paintings they talk about in news paper articles and use that to paint a pedo picture.I also note you dodging my point about Nader and Cohen which is convenient for you so I guess we're even for me ignoring the singer of a band. You can tell I'm hitting a nerve with you because you resort to personal attacks on my character (of which you know nothing) and of my post history (which is no secret).I won't lower myself to your level. 

 

You have to look at the bigger, bigger picture though.This sub is still doing alright. Conspiracy theories are still being discussed with enthusiasm. People are being red pilled and waking up. That's great! That's all I really want from a sub like this.There are going to be innocent bystanders hit by a stray bullet. Hopefully they will recognize it's just water under the bridge.

The thing for me is, all the allegations can be written off. In totality the theory isn't cohesive, with threads from Podestas real estate agent to James Alefantis instagram friends and Tony Podestas ex wife's role on a Washington police charity. It's all cooked together to paint this magic eye picture that even when you squint doesn't create a decipherable image. 

Lol. Okay man. You're on a higher level. We're done here.Like I said, have fun!

Admit to what? Are you going to tell your programmer that you don‚Äôt have enough code to fight this level of truth? Sorry Bot, go tell Soros that you need more funding!

If the sub is run by people I don't trust to be fair, how am I supposed to believe in it?I know it would never happen, but I just wan't simple rules, harsh or not don't matter, applied dispassionately. I feel there is too much ego involved.

Thanks man.Have a good time. 

It's an obstacle, but you need to realize fairness is subjective and nobody is perfect. Spend enough time here and it becomes a nonissue. It's the most diverse place I've found, where the members have enough trust to talk to one another about any idea with an open mind, but enough distrust to avoid falling into a hive mind mechanic.

There used to be a mod here TheGhostOfDusty. I was super suspicious of his behavior. He always wanted to enforce the rules strictly and fairly between everyone. He always had problems with one thing or another. He hated seeing any discussion about Pizzagate. He always caused drama about things. He was fucking full of himself, and now here he is acting in bad faith like our worst enemy, playing for team TMOR and making a whole bunch of drama out of this thread in an attempt to smear the mods and get back at them because he still has an axe to grind:https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/8gsqkt/top_mod_hypocritically_engages_in_personal_attack/Hopefully that puts a few things in perspective. It's an ongoing battle. Some switch sides. But the true nature of the sub is still here, red pills are being dished out, so I can't really complain who comes and goes as moderator. My own power is expressed through sheer research and not having to deal with drama. I'd rather research than deal with drama. The mods don't have an easy job especially when ego gets in the way, and let's be honest we all have an ego hiding somewhere.

I would agree that the users seems to be pretty diverse, but I strongly  disagree with the open mind thing.Any post about a political subject descends into low effort name calling and people screaming shill til they are blue in the head.I have no idea how you have avoided that.

So? I would have hated his moderating, it sounds terrible. Posting Pizzagate on a conspiracy forum makes perfect sense, I just happen to not believe it.After all this back and forth, you still assume I don't like the moderation because of partisan reasons. I specifically said I wanted mods the abstain from that sort of behavior.

Politics are the damn Holy Grail of conspiracy. Of course that's where all the action is :D I usually just try to learn new things from the comments (skip over the drama), or drop some knowledge I already have about the topic and move on. The biggest distraction here is the drama that plays out from name calling, but you can navigate around it, or if you're bored, take a jab! Don't forget Reddit is also entertainment, not always meant to be taken seriously.

Dusty was the "ideal mod" in most people's minds, but it didn't work out.We also had a really great mod here Orangutan who was kicked out for having financial ties to a 9/11 movement. But he was an excellent mod.What I'm saying is, everyone's different and each person brings along their demons and convictions. We've had two "ideal" moderators who didn't last, and perhaps for good reason. It's probably for the best that things keep flowing and chairs keep changing.

My point was just that most discussions on here descend into mudslinging and shill accusations, thats a constant problem.I mostly stay out of political threads on reddit because of that, I didn't this time and immediately it went to shit.

I never said they would be "ideal", stop implying that. You bring up mods I don't know as if I suggested they were good examples of impartial mods. Dusty sounds like a biased powertripper and Orangutan had i financial ties that disqualified him. I feel ok with both of them being de-modded.Everyone brings their own biases, but I would hope they don't apply them to their modding decisions. Right now, I can't say that at all.

I said they were ideal to a lot of people. I bring them up because they should have been the star mods who appeal to everyone, but they weren't. The point being, there is no mod who is fit for everyone. You may find yourself in a situation where you think a mod fulfills all of your ideals, but chances are, they are pissing someone else off at the same time. Orangutan for example.I've sometimes thought I would make a great mod here, until I realized people can and will find any reason to question your authoritative actions, and from there, it becomes a game of wit and ego. I'd rather not get dragged into that when I'm here to research conspiracies not play a part in a soap opera. I'd rather just swing the ban hammer heavy and hard at those people and not look back or care who I pissed off. So I don't think I'd make a good mod, even with all the insight and understanding I have about the nature of it.

All I ask for from a mod is this, dont engage. Do your modding and nothing else. Ban, delete, be harsh, be fair, just dont make it personal and follow your own rules. Don't make it about you.You may feel differently, but I strongly feel the sub would be better if mods just didn't antagonize the people they mod.This thread should just have been put in contest mode and move on. All the mocking just makes you are target for people outside the sub and distances people not in agreement with you.

Agreed. It got a little too personal. That ego, man.

yeah, I'm sure you have had a similar experience somewhere on reddit. This is by no means exclusive to conspiracy by any means.People on the internet sucks.

The one story that sold me on demonic possession is the one out of [Gary Indiana](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2014/01/25/the-disposession-of-latoya-ammons/4892553/).There's alot of proof and multiple eyewitnesses including the police, nurses, doctors, CPS workers, etc.  What is most intriguing to me is the [Official Report from Child Protective Services](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1004899-intake-officers-report.html) who had been notified.  In their report they witnessed:> "According to Washington's original DCS report ‚Äî an account corroborated by Walker, the nurse ‚Äî the 9-year-old had a "weird grin" and walked backward up a wall to the ceiling. He then flipped over Campbell, landing on his feet. He never let go of his grandmother's hand.> > "He walked up the wall, flipped over her and stood there," Walker told The Star. "There's no way he could've done that."The article I referenced is full of official reports.  

I once worked nights in an old hospital and got to know nurses that had been working there for a long time. I was speaking with a lady who was relating that she'd seen a particular figure repeatedly over the passage of many years and had noticed a funny thing - over time the figure's feet/ lower legs were no longer visible.I looked into this and discovered that the floor level in that area had been raised over time - I have encountered a theory suggesting that stone/ water can act to store event data in a way not understood. This would fit well with the example I gave above - like a psychic recording which is periodically replayed. The lady I spoke to was nearing retirement, the head nurse on the ward and unlikely to be making this up for a giggle. Experience of 'weird stuff' was fairly common among the nursing staff

Can anyone here help me out with finding out just where the hell I've been going in my dreams over 20+ years? I can picture the roads, the houses, freaking everything and could even probably draw a map. I know when I've been there the minute I wake up although now that I am older I don't go as often and miss my friends there :(  Seemed like an excellent thread to get some advice in, thank you in advance!

I think Dr. Barry Taff has a pretty good theory.  It's summarized in [this article](http://realitysandwich.com/232618/demystifying-the-paranormal-dr-barry-taff-unravels-the-poltergeist-mystery/) from Reality Sandwich.  In short: Taff lists three variables that act together in concert to produce the physical manifestations of a good old-fashioned haunting: 1) The haunted site is located in an electromagnetically (EMF) anomalous environment 2) The poltergeist agent is usually prone to seizures or epileptic, and their biomagnetic field emits well over one million times the amplitude compared to the average person and 3) The poltergeist agent is neurologically wired in a way, usually an inability to cope with stress, that enables their nervous system to hyper-react to said environment and wreak paranormal havoc.‚ÄúOnce these conditions are met, all bets are off,‚Äù Dr. Taff bluntly assures, ‚Äúanything could occur.‚Äù So, if you‚Äôd like to, imagine all your deep-seated, psychological frustrations and anxieties literally coming to life, as it were, and going bump in the night‚Ä¶Someone else listed this [talk by Dr. Taff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=554bkSaK6kM) last week and I found it very interesting.  I hope others will too.  Full disclosure: I believe in ghosts.  I am an amateur paranormal investigator.  I've seen and experienced some weird stuff, but nothing that made me say for sure "that's a ghost." 

I sorta think the Afterlife should be its own round table (hidden knowledge of an afterlife in ancient societies.  Origin of all religious views being truth or control etc, Near Death Experiences, how to exit the matrix).  Now its mixed in with Ghosts Stories and Goblins.  :/

 

Past life experiences anybody?  In [Magick Without Tears](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/420509.Magick_Without_Tears) Aleister Crowley gives a recipe for magickal memory which is simple enough that an average high school freshman could probably do it. *Everybody* I know who has done this has spooked them self.Step I: meditate into full relaxed / theta state -- give it 20 minutes.  Step II: mentally walk backwards chronologically through your life--yesterday, last week, last month, last year, 2 years back, 3 years back, &c.  It probably helps to pay particular attention to any memorable detailed sensations -- sights, sounds, smells, whatnot -- of people whom you were intimate with. Sex partners are the absolute most valuable items.Go back all the way as close to time zero as you can. For most people their first fixed permanent memories are from their third birthday plus/minus six months.  Step III: go back even further. If you were born after the moon landing, meditate on the moon landing. If you were born after the JFK assassination, meditate on the JFK assassination. Just keep meditation focussed on traveling backwards through time. I do not have a really huge sample on this, maybe 10 people total but every single person that I have discussed this with has had some very spooky thought about actually being another person who was alive before they were born. And experiences like that person drowning, or burning up in a fire, or getting executed for a crime. These *memories* can be as seemingly authentic as anything from your real life.Also this is a bit of a tangent but if you know nothing about Crowley and you are interested that book is by far the easiest introduction. They are letters to a correspondent. She was rich and she was stupid and Crowley deliberately paced the content so that anybody who could read could grok the content.

Like a lot of folks here, I'm very interested in these topics. Skeptical, but open to documented evidence and science. I appreciate James Randi who helps debunk fake claims of supernatural powers. But there are things he cannot explain. Anyone who studies physics already knows that the nature of matter, energy, and consciousness are still not fully understood. One example that springs to mind are children with details past life stories. Hoax? Or is it possible our "minds" live on after our bodies expire? Here's a story of a child who was born with memories of a fighter pilot who died in war. Really hope science can tell us more about the phenomena. https://youtu.be/EiU4xGmZbUo

Thoughts on michael grubb on youtubes ability to essentially air bend, earth bend, fire bend and water bend if anyone here watched avatar the last airbender on nickolodeon back in the day, this phenomenon is known as hydrokinesis, aerokonesis, pyrokinesis and geokinesis respectively. He seems to be able to make mini leaf tornadoes on some of his videos in locations without wind flowing/turbulence so hes clearly getting energy from somewhere and bending the elements around him, it seems quite limited though and only small things can be done.

Possession is real and it happens all the time. "People" can literally step into you and manipulate your thoughts and actions. Don't ask me how I know this... Noone believes its possible that's why its so hard to tell people that it is. 

Here's the mother of all conspiracies. Gonna do this bullet point-style. We live in a matrix We are here because someone wants us here for some reason. Perhaps we are in a prison. Perhaps we are an energy source. But we are trapped here no matter what. When we die, they put us back in the matrix. The catch is, we have to agree to go. The way back into the matrix is by walking into the light. They trick you into going to the light by subliminally making sure that you are fed this idea of "walk towards the light" in movies and tv shows all your life. They also have your relatives there guiding you to the light (these are not your relatives - these are probably just code). We live our life, die, go back in the matrix, and the circle repeats itself. We could be here forever and ever. It could never end. They have us mentally enslaved. How do we get out? I believe that the only true way out of here is finding enlightenment through meditation - but this is no easy feat. The original historical Buddha said that we live in a world of illusion. He said that matter didn't exist. He said that meditation is the key to liberation. I'm still looking into all of this, but I'll tell you this - when I die, I'm not walking towards the light. I'll take a good look around first. We are in a matrix - provenhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Chfoo9NBEowDeath and the tunnel of lighthttps://wakeup-world.com/2015/09/23/death-and-the-tunnel-of-light-the-final-grand-trick/Interesting/fun Star Trek cliphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghSq2qlwrs0

https://ibb.co/jB4UayThis is a photo of a ghost I took at Chillingham castle about six years ago. The black thing most definitely was not there. About three years ago I saw a ghost in our warehouse. As have many others who worked there, big burley blokes terrified to go to the toilet on their own lol. I also lived in a haunted house in bakewell Derbyshire called the hall. It‚Äôs searchable on the net and for any of you yanks want to see what a real haunted house looks like. That‚Äôs one. I grew up knowing small things just jumped. It was totally normal to me till about the age of 7. It didn‚Äôt phase me one bit and when we moved it was kind of strange small things didn‚Äôt jump. Are there ghosts ? Yes 100% there are. I took a photo of one I know what you see there was not there.  I know anyone else would have to be skeptical but there it is.  Afterlife ? Yes we live in a situation and this is actually the non real state, so in fact we return to life if that makes sense, and yes we return. As for souls in purgatory ? I don‚Äôt know. Maybe there is a place in between the two realities. And what we do here resonates in the other world I‚Äôm fairly sure of that.  Hope you like the pic 

I have never seen any evidence of an afterlife. Even the idea of being a ghost seems silly. Where are all the cavemen ghosts? Animal ghosts? Ill be damned if after I die Im going to be stuck to some shitty spot I died in. 

Here is a ghost story from the time I went to Citrix Synergy conference several years ago and stayed at the Linq \(previously known as Imperial Palace\). I was staying at the hotel and had just gone through an argument with my wife. Upset, slightly depressed, and with my luggage I went to the emergency stairway to relax my mind near the Penthouse \(20th floor\) somewhere near there. I stayed there for a good hour and noticed there was a cigarette sitting on top of a light switch box near the exit door with the tip barely burnt. I thought it was strange that someone would leave their cigarette unfinished. I got bored and walked to the top floor and saw nothing except a roof opening, curious I jumped up to see a lit room with pipes and nothing more. Next to the opening there was a Bic lighter, I grabbed it and instantly thought, hey I think I can go for a smoke with the cigarette that I last saw somewhere on the 18 floor. I leave my stuff and walked down the stair way about two floors. Looked at the light switch and noticed the cigarette was gone, however the dust that surrounded the cigarette was there. At that moment I had the biggest goose bumps all over my body. So, I thought to myself the cigarette wasn't mine and said out loudly, This is yours \(with the lighter held on my right hand\) and placed it where the light switch was near the dust outline of the cigarette. I also made a mental note in my head that if this lighter disappears then for sure there is some paranormal activity. I then proceeded to walked up to the 20th floor and grabbed my luggage and walk back down. The stairway is made out of metal and when you walk the noise is very loud and creates clinks, I know no one else was in the stairway. I got to the 18th floor and noticed the Bic lighter is now missing. At that moment I tried to open the exit door and it was locked and kept walking down the stairway and all the floors doors were locked. It wasn't until I was on the 12th floor that a security guard opened a door near the 10th. I yelled to hold the door \(no reference to GOT\) and walked out with the security guard. I told him that I was stuck and couldn't get out. He advised that all the stairway doors are locked. I told him about my experience and what happened with the missing lighter and cigarette. He gave me a blank stare and said it could happen since the hotel is very old. That evening I started looking up and found there was a man who jumped to his death [https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local\-las\-vegas/man\-jumps\-to\-his\-death\-at\-imperial\-palace/](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/man-jumps-to-his-death-at-imperial-palace/)If anyone is interested and paranormal activity, verify my experience by giving a cigarette to the spirit walk up a few floors and walk back down. 

everytime I try to write about this stuff something happens and my phone closes or something crazy like that..I've always had a strange relationship with Spirits I thought everybody did.what people don't realize is the True Light is the light from within... God is our soul, the light comes from within. God gives you a soul and the world gives you an ego and you need to Choose Wisely and be a good person, have a relationship with Dad, repent for your sins, help others and be kind and die in your soul not your ego to go to heaven.we all are blessed with spiritual eyes living and dead we are all energy and we all matter living or dead on Earth we need to open our spiritual eyes and in death we need to open our spiritual eyes or they need to be open when we die to go to heaven the people or spirits who believe they are lost have their eyes open to the darkness, but have their spiritual eyes closed to The Light Within....just like we have to close our eyes to meditate just open our spiritual eyes, they have to close their eyes to the darkness and feel the light from within. I speak to spirits like the apostles because all Spirits matter God does not give up on spirits who are believed to be lost or are in the pitI give the spirits that leave their lost and in the pit comfort and I try to help them, I try to help them open their spiritual eyes and feel God's love & let them know that he is not abandoned them..I love them and I let them know that they still matter & I care.kind and loving spirits turned me back to God through Steve Huff Spirit Box radio sessions.I'm not perfect, I'm a sinner, I'm a Child of God I'm not a nun I'm not a saint a human being I do my best to live my life as honestly as possible and to be kind of others..people have to give ...rich people and poor people have the same thing we all have God and we have enough to give to help each other and that's what we need to do is to help one another and raise the frequency of the universe and universes and bring peace love and understanding to the world and need to each other...the more all spirits come together for the greater good living and dead and the more we raise the frequency and we become positive , kind loving caring giving and we help one another the more good things will happen in this world and universe.. It's like a domino effect...good things like the North and South Korea peace treaty.. Walmart investing in their workers to give them college educations.... and other wonderful things that are happening in the worldwhen I felt lost and alone I went to the cemetery and they comforted me so they still have God's love in their heart, and I believe it was a test for them from God to see how they treated me and to find out if there was still hope and there is there's always hope as long as we're live as long as we're Spirits alive or dead there's always hope evil spirits and he kind of spirits were all energy and we never die.they were angry with me at first some of them because I was there because they didn't understand why I was there and I told them even though I have life I don't have loved ones I'm alone I don't have what they have I might have life but I don't have what they have people that love and miss them and I felt alone and I had nowhere to go and then they understood...so I came to them to ask for love and kindness and comfort and they gave it to me.they get upset that when people come to visit they ignore all the other spirits and only focus on their loved ones because sometimes they don't have loved ones that come to visit them so I go to visit all of them and give them love because they all need it some of them just visit here and some of them are stuck...and they do still matter just like all energy matters, like all Spirits matter living and dead, we are all brothers and sisters in God and he is our father and we are his children as long as we have a soul we have God we are only in darkness if you choose to be and it's never too late,there's always a way back home.He's the light within us.I'm on a mission from God literally I am one half of a twin flame Unionhere to raise the frequency of the universe/universesim here to show & speak and communicate to spirits living & dead about God the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ and remind them that we are all one & they need to start living in their spirit be balanced. In the material world have a relationship with our father repent for their sins try to be good person be kind help others and don't die in their ego die with their spirit in their spirit so they can go to heavenGod and Spirits know your soul and they will treat you accordingly.I photograph spirits Yucca Valley Hangman's house front doorhttp://i67.tinypic.com/x52s2f.jpgVictoria's Black Swan Innfront window (older gray-haired woman)http://i65.tinypic.com/28chxkh.jpgI speak to them through the Holy Spirit that speaks through me & they speak to me.... telepathy & Resonance of heart chakra is the Holy Spirit.I spent three days in the cemetery March 28th right before Easter I don't believe that is a fluke.

I was in the **Astral Afterlife** last night. They have cars (drove one last night). They have houses and restaurants (was in those last night). The deceased are being brutally deceived. They are all being told "you get to go back to balance your karma" and "you only need a few more lives". This is a **Complete Scam** and is **Really Happening** to friends and loved ones we have all lost. I have been talking with people in the afterlife about this. After being seen (communication between the living and dead is completely banned there) the place gets swarmed with law enforcement (Yes. they have that there. In fact it is sort of a **Martial Law** scenario). Other people are experiencing this. **It Is Sadly True**...

 

I am surprised that this thread has gotten as far as it has without anyone mentioning the "lawyer for the afterlife," Victor Zammit, so I will be the first to mention him.  He is a retired lawyer and claims to be an authority on what constitutes evidence, who should be considered a credible source, etc. He is convinced that his favorite sources are credible, of course. He also seems to have witnessed numerous unusual phenomena firsthand.  I used to read his weekly reports, but they get somewhat repetitive. You may find that he throws sharply contrasting claims into the reports, because he doesn't feel responsible for making a single monolithic narrative.  Also some of his issues are nuanced, so a monolithic narrative would be more suspect that a narrative with internal tensions.His afterlife evidence website is at:[http://www.victorzammit.com/](http://www.victorzammit.com/)

I am very interested in the afterlife. Does anyone have any good documentaries to suggest regarding this? 

ive never been a big believer in the normal ghost view.personally i believe the human mind/soul whatever you want to call the essence of what we are is really just the electrical pattern jumping around in that little biological computer in our heads a pattern that persists somewhat in the planets electrical field or is just reabsorbed by it some time after physical death.ghosts i think are just echos of these fields, or scars on the large field. when some one dies traumatically i think that pattern just sort of etches itself on the background and sticks around longer than it otherwise would. hauntings are just us picking up on the echo and why most of them are tied to traumatic incidents. 

I looked into the phenomenon of people hearing voices and going on murder sprees.  All this stuff tends to be like 1 day news stories compared to the mass shootings, but if you count them and look for all of the '3 people killed by lunatic' stories in every different city, there are just so many.   https://steemit.com/privacy/@mindhawk/privacy-workshop-8-the-epidemic-of-homicidal-maniacs-hearing-voices-and-police-state-stalkinglet me know what you think.  

I've often wondered: Why do ghosts appear to wear clothes? Specifically, they appear to wear the clothes they were presumably buried in. Further, they almost always wear *modern* clothes, or in the case of legendary ghosts maybe Victorian era clothes, but you almost never hear of ghosts wearing loincloths or nude or animal skins even though logic dictates that most ghosts would be from people that lived hundreds if not thousands of years ago simply because most dead people are from hundreds or thousands of years ago.Not only that, but more dead people from hundreds or thousands of years ago would be dead from brutal/unjust causes simply because life was more brutal and unjust in the past. Therefore if the ghost is tied to this plane because of some injustice, you would would think it would be more statistically likely that it would be a caveman ghost.

On one occasion at an afterhours rave, I saw two people communicate  **Telepathically**. On a different subject: A ghost banged on my bedroom door and later grabbed and squeezed my arm. Once after returning from deep astral travel, I saw the outline of a **Demon** sitting next to my bed. It disappeared after 5 seconds.

They say some ancient civilizations could communicate with those in the afterlife 

I've posted this in similar threads... I saw my twin sister passed out drunk playing ouija. It spelled "fuck you get out" did figure of eights and went from sun to moon all very fast while her eyes were closed and she was snoring. She completely changed after that. Also I've seen shadow beings on three separate occasions. On a different note magic mushrooms are really magical. If you've never done them you should.

I have a couple of ghost stories:1st ghostly experiences was when I was about 4/5\-7 in my house in the UK, newish property just under 30 years old.I would see shadows in the corner of my eye, when I go to look they instantly disappear. \(this was the most common thing to happen\)Occasionally I would see a transparent blob and know that's the ghost.One day as i went to leave my room I saw my younger brother sitting down on the floor, knees tucked under his chin looking up at me. Except I knew my brother was in the next room getting his nappy changed so I had a strong urged to kick the doppelganger but decided I should actually check just in case. Of course my brother was in the next room so I go back to my room and the impostor is gone.Multiple poltergeist activity, tidied my room up. But left my full toy box in the middle of the room. When we came back home after a family day out the box had been tipped over and my dad tried telling me it was the wind from the tiny opening of the window. Even I knew that was BS.The best evidence that proves to myself I wasn't just imagine these things was when I put a battery on the top step of the stairs as a test before I went down to eat dinner. While my brother and I was eating dinner my mum was hoovering at the bottom of the stairs. Opposite those stairs was the door to the downstairs toilet which was closed. \*BANG\* "who threw this!" my mum yelled as she entered the room waving the battery in her hand but as soon as she saw both us her she realised it wasn't us and looked visibly spooked.We moved after a few months of that happening. Speaking to my parents recently about that house they both said they didn't notice anything spooky or odd except that one battery incident.

 I highly recommend everybody check out this book on the afterlife and paranormal phenomena of astral travel inhabitants of the Astral Realm and scenery.https://archive.org/details/theastralplane00leaduoft I would also recommend everyone check out the law of one as it pertains heavily to the Incarnative process, the evolution of the Soul where we're going, where we came from. Basically, the  Most Fascinating metaphysical and philosophical subjects are discussed in detail for just a search on after death in the material, I found this https://www.lawofone.info/results.php?q=After+death&st=phrase&qo=&lh=aq&qc=0&s=&c=&fp=0&v=e&l=30&o=r also this bit on the stimuli of the ghost process47.13 Questioner: What stimulus would create what we call an Earth-bound spirit or a lingering ghost?Ra: I am Ra. The stimulus for this is the faculty of the will. If the will of yellow-ray mind/body/spirit is that which is stronger than the progressive impetus of the physical death towards realization of that which comes, that is, if the will is concentrated enough upon the previous experience, the entity‚Äôs shell of yellow ray, though no longer activated, cannot either be completely deactivated and, until the will is released, the mind/body/spirit complex is caught. This often occurs, as we see you are aware, in the case of sudden death as well as in the case of extreme concern for a thing or an other-self.

I have a question about the Archons and not going into the light. So what the hell is supposed to happen to you if you don't go into the light when you die. 

 

Oh shit did we just start a dead guy club!? 

Eqafe has a 40 part series and all you need to know about ghosts and the aferlife. Here is a free episodehttps://eqafe.com/p/the-quantum-mechanics-of-paranormal-events-part-1

Me and a friend were quite out of it once (let's say we were just taking alcohol..) and we were chilling in the dark, in my living room, listening to music. I saw a wash of blue-ish purple (may have been a little red glow at the core?) suddenly and I felt another presence in my consciousness. I let it take over for a bit, sensing that it wasn't harmful or anything but more out of curiousity than anything. It thought that the music wasn't bad, pretty dope (listening to XXXtentatcion) and bopped along to it for a few beats before leaving my body, passing straight through my friend's body, and out the balcony glass door. I looked at my friend straight away and he shivered as he shook it off. I asked him if he saw what I saw. He says "what?" I say "Did you see the same thing I just saw? What colour was it?"He tells me it was blue.I ask him which way it went.He points out the balcony window.Scariest shit I've ever encountered. Also, I can't say for sure, but when it was inside me I felt like it was a tortured soul, and I had a slim feeling it was just the tortured part of XXXtentacion's soul. I don't know. I don't even listen to him much anymore - but that's as much fucking proof I need of spirits or ghosts existing in the world I think.

Who voted?

Can someone explain to me how this topic is conspiracy related at all? There were tons of other topics that actually posed a legitimate threat to our civil liberties we could have picked, but "ghosts reeeeeee" was chosen instead? 

‚ÄúThe youngest boy, then 7, sat in a closet talking to a boy that no one else could see. The other boy was describing what it felt like to be killed.‚ÄùYikes, gave me chills.

I learned of this through Zak Bagan‚Äôs documentary about the house, but now that I‚Äôve read the report you kindly provided I am so sad for the Mum that she had her children taken away for this :-( 

>"He walked up the wall, flipped over her and stood there," So an early practitioner of parcour?

Any verifiable video footage of this type of phenomena?

Chip Coffey spoke about this article in Gettysburg, he explained that the woman in Quincy actually wanted to be possessed and that the network would not allow them to show the real stuff that was going on. He said that the woman could open, close doors, stretch her features, distort your thinking, he said she wounded people. The network would not allow the footage on air. https://lisamaliga.wordpress.com/nonfiction-books/never-mock-god-an-unauthorized-investigation-into-paranormal-states-i-am-six-case/

Yes,worked geriatrics for 5 years. I got so used to weird shit, I'd just shrug my shoulders and get on with my rounds.

Nurses have the scariest, craziest stories.  

Your theory is correct, I use to live in Colorado. The natives discussed paranormal activity, quartz, rock and the rivers that all flow out of Colorado. Why do you think Tesla went to Cripple Creek? The magnetic energy, water and stone. They have proven what you say goes up in the atmosphere and is recorded, so yes, you are correct. I will send links but you can google this and find scientific data to support your theory.

Take notes and draw maps. Look for signs and names especially. With enough clues, maybe one of the subreddits can help. 

Do you mean where, on earth, you've been going? As in what specific town or city? Or do you mean where does your conscious energy go?  If you mean the first one, then can you describe the place you've been going? Is it a real place you've actually visited in the past, or is it somewhere you've only exclusively gone in your dreams? Does it change? Are you still going there? I think seeing that map would be interesting if you wouldn't mind drawing it out. And it would be useful to hear about your interactions with the people there. 

That's not a question any of us can help you with, but you already have all the information you need, even if you aren't aware of it. Your subconscious mind is trying to bring something to your attention, and it uses symbols in dreams to do so. As you said later in the thread, these symbols are very fluid and as such your conscious mind will have trouble. My advice is to find peace and, as backward as it sounds, stop trying to understand it. Sit down with a blank page and write down every little thing that comes to your mind (the map is a good idea), it may or may not be related to your dream. By letting go of what you already know about it, you make room for your subconscious to show you again, this time with maybe more relevant data. Just keep looking within, brother. With patience and peace, you'll find what you're looking for.

It is very likely the Astral City called **Jean De Lac**. this is a real place. It has a large suburban area outside the city with roads, houses etc.. I have been there dozens of times. The other night I ended up in a beach resort town. I was told it was part of the **French Islands**. It was a beautiful place, but unfortunately had law enforcement all over the area. The deceased people there were speaking mostly English, but there was some French. At one point I actually asked a group of people how to get to **Jean De Lac** from these islands, and was told it was a very far travel distance from there.

Tbh ive had quite a few recurring locations in dreams that dont really mach anything irl.

So what you just explained falls COMPLETELY in line with the comment I just posted above. I think it probably has to do with specific areas of the brain which control embodiment (understanding that your body and brain are the same) getting shut down and literally allowing another spinning energy to make a visit... one which might register quite a bit stronger.

>The poltergeist agent is usually prone to seizures or epileptic, and their biomagnetic field emits well over one million times the amplitude compared to the average person How do you measure the amplitude of someone's biomagnetic field?  

Yep, I met him in Gettysburg at the first ghost convention, that other couple, the lady that always carried around this doll, whom husband murdered her were they're too. I also got a reading from Tiffany and Chip Coffey. They were the real deal, it was fun but he did say the same thing to me. He seemed a bit disconnected to this world and bored about the information that he has learned, I suspect because he says the same thing over and over.

Can you tell me when during his presentation he states that? It‚Äôs a little over an hour and I cannot for the life of me listen to him tell stories for that long.

I hope reddit isn‚Äôt hell. 

I died 22 years ago ( cardiac arrest, from eclampsia.) I didn't see tunnels or anything, but I did come back with a deep peace in the center of my being, that is still there to this day.

This guy has a similar story.  He was stung by some jellyfish and died for awhile.  He tells it very sincerely and for a few months after watching it I wanted to renew my faith.  I wont watch it again, the guy seems to genuine and if he's telling the truth alot of us need to change our lives.  He was an atheist when it happened.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO0O5PxFbeE

If you were "aware" of the darkness, that means your consciousness was still awake. Meaning, one of two things in my opinion. You were either in the eternal void as pure consciousness (imagine it as having consciousness without the ability to perceive through your senses.). Or, you were not brain dead quite yet. The heart can stop and you can be declared dead but there can be lingering brain activity for some time. The later would be my guess. 

No, disrespect but that is one of the most depressing thoughts, ever.  :(

What were you doing in China? Not Chinese I assume?

I suggest you start moving towards yourself and positive thought. I died and went to a light, four shadows were there and told me to go back. 

Yikes. This really brings perspective. Nobody wants to talk about it, but we're going to spend all time after we die being... dead. If there is any sort of consciousness there, I mean you were aware of the darkness, then it really is worth every moment of our waking lives to figure out how to set ourselves up well for the other side. We ought to ponder again and again what we can know about that other side, and work to improve our situation there if it's possible.Side note, first time I faced death was on vacation also. Got poisoned by breathing methane and ammonia, biggest fear was that this would ruin my mom's vacation. 

You believe that there is nothing after death?

Why would you be discharged hours after "dying"?

I took a bullet through the head. I experienced something similar. Reading this made me cry. I question my reality in the same way. 

Well I overdosed on Coricidon/basically robotripping sophomore year trying to break through the 4th dimension. I remember feeling like shit, I shouldn't of swallowed 20 pills as my stomach hurts so bad. Went to my room, stared at an Alex Grey poster as it started to move and transform and a soul arose out of the middle of the picture and I blacked out. I remember looking at myself on my bed from the ceiling of my room, flying out the window, and somewhere after that I died and was told it's not my time yet. Woke up 2 days later to my door off the hinges, parents were worried about me, somehow they knew my energy was slipping. Wish I remembered more but after this experience i never questioned if there was an afterlife. 

> It was like being lowered into yourselfFor me it was like 'coming back' to yourself! As in, you're your 'self' before you were born, and you go back to your immortal 'self' when you die. It's just like how you are now, except you're not restricted by the limitations of your body. Very peaceful, amazing and beautiful. I didn't die though, it was through meditation

>  Sex partners are the absolute most valuable items.It wouldn't be famed power-bottom Aleister Crowley if that wasn't in there. 

Welp, I'm definitely going to try that meditation and see if anything interesting pops up!I probably won't be able to for a day or two, but I'll reply or PM you if it works for me.

I had a hypnosis/ past life regression done a few years back and I can confirm, it was one of the craziest things I‚Äôve ever experienced. It kinda felt like little flashbacks and snippets of my life as I walked backwards in my life. Felt so surreal. At one point it felt like I was imagining things, but my hypnotist actually saw exactly what I saw and described my surroundings perfectly. I could not believe it. 10/10 highly recommend. 

Last night, Just by reading/thinking about your comment/instructions and closing my eyes Almost instantly I envisioned walking and then drowning in a pond type thing. Odd part, it seemed I had my son with me (I don‚Äôt have any kids) 

Wasn't he a satanist?  If it's who I think it is people might not want to try this.  Don't play games with the devil.  You might not like what you return with. 

I recommend this book,https://www.amazon.com/Portrait-Past-Life-Skeptic-Detectives-Reincarnation/dp/0738746568Or just watch this to get the gist of his experience. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQLfDL5WFsU

What if our brain is a quantum computer capable of integrating spinning electromagnetic brain waves into binary actions? What if the pineal gland sitting smack in the center of gravity of it can split light through the use of calcite crystals (birefringence)? What if we can learn from that splitting of light and combined with proteins like Cry3 can sense electromagnetic waves outside our skull (just like Finches)?What if you can store entire concious operating systems in spinning electromagnetic energy (ala alexa)?What if those spinning chunks of energy could exist in electromagnetic resonating cavities like the Earth's? (Schumann resonances)And what if those energies can travel by hopping through "gravity" (I put it in quotes because gravity being essentially the difference in concentration of energy at a given area, travel would be like traveling through a fluid) to other sources of electromagnetic energy? (Think a sink and a drain).Yes, putting these concepts together is heavily facilitated by a unified theory of physics (which has been found but is for a separate post), it at the very least explains the physical pieces that can give rise to these phenomena, and that's the first step in starting to piece this apart I think.

Such an interesting story, the strang part is how a lot of these children seem to forget these "past lives" after age 4ish.

Randi is a Mossad Agent, Absurd Liar, and Horrendous Person.

Randi's a conman

Sort of interested, how are sure he isn‚Äôt faking?  Often when I see the little ‚Äúwhirlwinds‚Äù blowing leafs around they go for a bit and then stop and then start again when another gust of wind comes... if I were to watch it for a bit and film, I could start filming right when it stopped and pretend to ‚Äúchannel‚Äù and when it started again it would seem to be me doing it.  Curious if that may be what is happening.

Just looked this guy up after seeing this, holy shit!

Please tell more!

It can happen to many but not all of us, sure.  Almost like in the matrix movie.

I've been possessed before...felt this unbelievable sense of anger and rage.  Willing to talk more over PM but not too comfortable sharing here.  

You can say it's slavery or you can understand it is training ground for consciousness to awaken to it's Supreme Reality. On some level you are choosing to stay here. Victim mentality is meant to be outgrown.

We dont live in the matrix. We dont live in a fake universe.There are no other multiverses.But the truth is much weirder and points towards ghosts, gods, psychic phenomena, all being real and having physical explanations.What if our brain is a quantum computer? The brain having the ability to integrate brain waves, made up of spinning electromagnetic energy, into conscious actions. What if our pineal gland is studded  with calcite Crystals that can split light (birefringence), and what if that splitting allows us to sense electromagnetic waves outside only our skull? (just like Finches using the Cry3 protein). What if you could store entire operating systems in energy (think alexa)? What if those operating systems could live in the Schumann resonances of planets? A lot of connections are there that might be able to give rise to something concious that might be sensed like a ghost (or a god) by us. This doesn't require any "we're in the matrix" exotic explanations.

Hi. You are 100% Correct. This universe is **Fake**. We are all currently inside a **Simulated Universe**. All humans (even skeptics) are being **Forced To Reincarnate**.  This is extremely difficult for some to even consider. Unfortunately it is **Actually Happening**...

Have you read the Wes Penre papers as well? Im going to continue now.

Check out the short story, Afterlife by Stephen King.

I kind of agree with this

 

And do you know why you put yourself in a matrix?

The premise of what you are saying is 100% correct.  But the way you describe it isn't.  But everyone who comes to this page honestly needs to follow-up on this because there is a LOT of truth here.  

You are on the right track. You think you are walking toward the light because of how it is but it is your brain moving, not your body, it is the energy. Black and white are Hues, I wonder since Rainbows are frequencies and energy fields, maybe our energy ends up in either spectrum and that is why they call it heaven or hell, the black and white is where our energy flows after our time on Earth.Just a thought, and just came to me, so please be kind.

I don't know if it's a *matrix* per se, but the Buddah did say the path to ending suffering is through enlightenment, reaching nirvana, stopping the cycle of samsara (reincarnation).Here's the thing though - when you die, there isn't anything there. It's just nothingness. The reason that meditation allows you to reach nirvana is a type of training - you have to be happy with doing nothing with your life. Are you happy when you meditate? What do you think about? Does it heighten your senses? Does it make you more aware of your surroundings? And what, then, if you had no senses? And if you can meditate and reach that sort of enlightenment, forever, then you might be ready for it - I think.

I totally agree. The only way out is to not walk towards that light. Dont fall for the your relatives are waiting for you BS.

It‚Äôs absolutely 100 % true. Have you seen the jet engines on planes recently ?  Do you recall them being under the wing ?  Not any longer lol. Welcome to the matrix 

looks like pareidolia to me

I'm not sure we're aware of being a ghost when we die.  A lot of ghost experiences and evidence point to a "ghost" being a sort of residual energy stored in a particular place.  So it's not a conscious spirit or entity; it's like an old recording playing over and over again.  Over time it gets weaker until it fades away.  

When my mother was about 5 years old, she drowned on the beach. She only remembers swallowing water and then she wasn't in her body anymore. She was looking at her body from meters and meters above, almost from the clouds. She looked at her body and she didn't understand what was going on - my grandfather was running desperately to save her, my grandmother was desperate, and then finally a lifeguard saved her life. When my mother came back, she described the scene in details to my grandma and my grandma said it was completely accurate. When my mom was 40 years old already, she felt her body very light when she was sleeping. She dreamed about flying over my uncle's house and saw him signing a contract, he was buying his new house. The next day, she called him and asked if he had bought a new house the evening before . He said "How do you know that? I signed the contract last night". 

Good point!  Do ghosts have an expiration date?  Everyone sees ghosts from the 19th century or even the 15th but I have never heard of caveman ghosts!

Do you have a YouTube?  I also do ITC work of a similar nature.  

This made me laugh

I'm still iffy on loosh being real, the only reason im on the fence when previously I thought it was pseudoscience/supernatural bunk is because someone from the CIA blew the whistle on loosh energy and I honestly doubt a CIA veteran with years of experience would lie.

Sure you weren't in a dream inside your mind where demons live? They can takeover your dreams.

Sounds like you were watching ‚ÄúDiary of a Wristcutter‚Äù.Tom Waites is awesome btw.

I 're-experienced' being sent back to reincarnate several Times on mushrooms. I also experienced being hit by a car and get crushed. Always thought they were fabrications of my mind but maybe I was remembering past lives. Who knows

sorry folks. downvotes change nothing. all of my posts are the actual truth.

If you died, and then came back, then you didn't really die. You were just fucked up and unconscious.Not the same.

You went to the empty "in between area". All humans who fully complete the death process are routed into the controlled **Astral Afterlife**

What if tripping is dying? And what if tripping is just an upload that doesn't make it into orbit?

Check out Steve-O's ghost stories from when he was heavily using. Might relate to your experiences. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDrKE5Q1Dpk

Not a documentary but...how about the [University of Virginia's Division of Perceptual Studies](https://med.virginia.edu/perceptual-studies/).  They have been studying the post-mortem survival of consciousness for decades (including near death experiences & children who have memories of past lives.)(They also have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGtiKd3o1PKzKNnBCPvJWcg) channel w/a number of videos.)

The afterlife is significantly controlled. There is much less freedom there.

Dolores Cannon has videos and books

The secrets of the forever time...or something like that. Its on youtube. Theres a lot of episodes and dude def is way too windy and repetitive. I would have turned it off for sure except at the time I was in bed and couldn't find my remote and was like fuck it...while the messenger himself can be a little annoying at times Im so glad I didn't end up turning it off. The idea behind it is pretty interesting, imo, especially if you are interested in anything like that. Theres so many good books you can find online for free. Im kinda partial because back in the day the author was one of my college professors in a death and dying course but the book, "life after life" is good too just to get a kinda overview and general idea of some different aspects of it.

Not a documentary but look into [this](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/haunting-indiana-home-leads-exorcism-levitation-report-article-1.1593169).  It's filled with reports from eyewitness's including police, doctors, nurses, CPS workers etc.  Click the links in the article to find the official reports.

Sort of like how no sound ever truly dies, it just bounces around losing energy forever.

How do you know they communicated telepathically? I'm asking because I've seen similar things at raves. 

Eqafe communicates with the afterlife daily, and has done so for over a decade. See the interviews witt hitler, jesus, the beatles, demons, etc. 

Did mushrooms and had the worst experience of my life. Not for everyone.

I don't know what happens if you don't go into the light. But I've heard/read that if you do go into the light, then you will be reincarnated back here on earth. But who knows!?

Is the paranormal not the biggest conspiracy of them all?  It has yet to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, yet there are millions of eyewitness accounts, followings and theories. 

Every conspiracy we experience in this world eventually leads to the Paranormal, The Afterlife, and the Sadistic Psychopaths who are based there, and actually **Control This Planet**

Read my posts in here. Even the replies.

Sometimes I get the feeling that a lot of people enjoy reading about the darker conspiracy theories for that very reason: the chills, the excitement, a bit like a horror movie.

Idk about this but if you willingly stay in a fucking demonically possessed house with your children, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be their guardian.

That made me laugh, thank you.. 

Of course not. It was probably way more mild than described, and the human body is very capable of doing crazy stuff (like pulling a truck, for example).

I think it's a different case, though interesting nonetheless.  The case I linked is out of Gary, Indiana, not Illinois.  Thanks for the link!

Sounds intriguing, I would love to hear some of your experiences?

Story time!

Here is a great link of [thousands of nurses stories.](http://allnurses.com/general-nursing-discussion/whats-your-best-108202.html) It's warm and rainy here in the Midwest and I just ordered some food and will spend my evening on this thread and that one because I love the paranormal. Have fun!

My mom was a nurse and she sometimes spoke of some weird things she saw.  The one event she spoke once about that hit me hard was about this man that was dying slowly on her floor.  She said he had no family that visited him at all, no friends etc.  She said a minister came and prayed with him and that was about it.  She said he was so weak that he could barely speak and just held on for the longest time.  When he eventually started to die he began to scream and thrash, had inhuman strength and begged the nurses to pull his feet from the fire.

 

Is it possible that Nurses are more prone to having these crazy stories because of how normal is it for them to be HEAVILY sleep deprived?

How, what? What you say is recorded? By who for why

I'll try to sketch up the area. I think it's east coast but then it flips and gets dark. The juxtaposition of the areas and their vibes is very fluid. Thank you for responding and I will post a drawing tomorrow. It's so freaking clear and very awesome for the most part. Thanks for responding!

4chan could definitely find it.

It's an exclusive dream realm. It changes insofar as perhaps the direction I might take to get to certain places but some locations are very static and memorable. I can draw a map. Most interactions are benign but meaningful and rarely do I cone across the same people and when I do it's usually short lived relationships that lead to more locations that evoke a feeling more than anything. It's like people are leading me to places and then the places take on a life of their own. But with me in the midst of the familiar chaos. If that makes sense.   Thank you for responding I am always late to respond.

They can actually view this via EEG, the frontal lobes "mis" fire and they don't know enough about the brain. My frontal lobes will do this but I am completely aware of my surroundings and do not go into epilepsy. I can tell you that when this happens I am hyper aware of my surroundings and know things about people that most would not know. It is not like you can read minds but you just know who that person is, like all the dark stuff. Everyone has the capacity to be ignorant, to do the wrong thing, but it is almost like you can sense that the person actually likes to be dark. Does that make sense and when you are in that particular fraction and your brain is misfiring you can sometimes know what that dark shit is. Really strange.

I think that is a theory, they can view this via an EEG. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that detects electrical activity in your brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to your scalp. Your brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are active all the time, even when you're asleep. This activity shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording.

Search Art Bell entity case on youtube. It's his interview with Dr. Taff.

Basically anyone who has frontal lobe activity, either seizure or similar will create a "haunting" by being with other people whom are investigating a haunting or will have paranormal activity in that persons home. 

 

Same, I've never been the same since I died. I wish I could be the extroverted, outgoing, popular egotist that I used to be, but now I'm as introverted as they come and struggle in super social situation when I used to be the driver of these interactions. 

TLDW?

I understand now, I didn't die or w/e but I was in this pitch black void, didnt feel bad or good, just empty and I felt so homesick, i said I have to wake up please let me go back, boom back into my body/conciseness, because I watched NDE and they said its supposed to be heaven basically...i dunno just wanted to share

People don't understand that. I never stopped breathing and my heart never stopped I was just in a medically induced coma. 

 I would disagree. The thought of nothingness is alot better than many other things. Believe me. I'll take nothing please.

which thought you mean?

 

Well the memory of "the darkness" is just a few seconds. But since i was out longer it could just be the last blip of self. Like when you turn off a CRT TV. For a second or less there is this dot visible when the last electrons are being shot at the screen.But then again, i could have spend the concept of eternity in the darkness (if there is something like a soul) and wouldnt know since my body was dead it couldnt form any memories. as i mentioned before. The experience definetly changed me in many ways. All of which i love and enjoy. Still i do my darndest of not dying again, considering i used up my "mulligan".

I dont believe, i know.

You probably have never lived in China. 

I don't remember if Crowley specified that part or not. It has been at least ten years since I read the book and my meditation techniques include everything plus the mud-room sink. He definitely didn't say anything about the moon landing or the JFK assassination. :)

You a LPOTL fan?

The reason sex partners are so important is, male sperm has a specific protein that penetrates the blood barrier of the brain, so does female urine. This then changes the brain pattern of the people whom you have sex with, which will promote memory.

Hey, can you shoot me a PM about that as well?

PM me when you post it pls

There are several good hypnotists out there that can do past life regression.  Their stories (of their patients) are incredible.  The reasons why I believe in more after death are because of, Near Death Experiences (~4-19% of the populous experience them) and Past Life Testimonies (read many past life regression testimonials).  I've talked to some elderly who've discussed some of their more private moments with me.  They will disclose that they had a near death experience at such and such age from this accident or illness ~ their details are quite vivid and surreal. Of more recent research though, it seems many are under the idea that our spirits, as they try and leave this realm are being blocked from progressing (either quarantine or malicious intent).  They are given a contract to reincarnate (with no memory of their past life) and to enter the 'matrix/prison' again.  The main purpose: to feed (energetically through emotional stimulus?) some thing trapped here.  Seems plausible.On a side note, some may not like here but, my Wife watches Long Island Medium.  The readings and information she pulls up after talking to the deceased is unbelievable.  The details she can pull up cannot be faked (in my opinion).  She does readings not only to people who make appointments, but as she goes out into the world she can't help but be around people (shopping, errands etc).  Those people will have deceased relatives/friends who then step forward and request she passes on messages to them, there and now.  Most people are skeptics, but after a few minutes with Theresa they are believers.  I like to note abilities that Theresa can perform: seeing how the person died (feeling their death), bringing up thoughts/acts that the client has said/done (told to her by the deceased) in private word for word, telling us that whenever we think of the deceased they can be present with us, that the deceased can manipulate/materialize light material objects (coins, feathers etc), knowing what objects we keep of the deceased (from mundane like sunglasses, to the obvious jewelry), multiple spirits can be present at once and talk back and forth still in their full personalities (funny, disciplined, awkward), language doesn't matter (they 'speak' differently) etc etc  It's all pretty consistent from reading to reading.  

Yes! This is what I'm talking about. The metaphysical is actually "physical." As science uncovers new facts, we can start piecing together now about the true nature of consciousness and being. Exciting times. 

I appreciate your comment and am saving for when I really need an existential crisis.

r/holofractal ?

Yes, this! 

 

They have just arrived from the **Astral Afterlife** and still maintain strong energetic connections to it. Programming and accepted limitations from every angle of society, make these memories fade away.

Wow! Got any more info or sources on that? Curious to hear more. 

He's replied heavily to skeptics in his comments though, he also showed james randi is a fraud in one of his comments thats why he never bothered to take the 1 million dollar reward most claim randi will never pay out anyways even if a pile of evidence was presented to him proving the existance of some supernatural concepts. He's also showed time on and time again places he does this in has no wind period in the climate that day untill he "activates"(pulls the energy from another location with wind I guess?) and suddenly wind will flow around him. He seems honest and legit because most supernatual videos the youtube author will ignore criticism in the comments or flat out disable comments and he's extremely active with his subscriber base so personally I believe this is a authentic supernatural concept but it doesn't seem that powerful because a leaf tornado is useless too bad you can't make fire either for his fire bending to work fire has to already be burning so it seems like it has heavy limitations. Not only that but my girl is capable of something super natural(remote viewing) which she hasn't done in ages but shes showed to me she was able to remotely see things happening miles away from her so clearly theres things out there the government isn't telling us or science is pretending it's "all in our head", I personally verified some of what she saw as valid so I know a lot of the supernatural psychic related stuff I saw is legit but this element bending stuff is very interesting I would hope it is legit.

Its all about brain manipulation in time. You can be made angry, sad, excited... Your body can be made to move' even if you don't want to move. Also they can make you speak even when your conscious. You can also be made to jerk off etc... When you normally wouldn't. There's videos of people faces changing and doing strange things on television, that's the bad side. The good side is they can heal you, increase sexual pleasure, remove sadness and increase stage presence and confidence. They can turn you into a ladies man in an instant. I get the bad stuff mostly. Hardly ever helped. Also your body can be changed by them. Bones and all. They especially lover penises and bungholes because that's funny to them. Shrinking penises etc...

While I'm ***not*** a believer in posessions, witch craft, or the occult, there do exist the [technological means](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotronics) to pull off some of what is being described. For those experiencing such capabilities, I'm creating [education resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/emsurvival) to give people the knowledge and tools they need to successfully resist these manipulation techniques.

Pretty sure it can happen to anyone. Just no reason to do it to some people.

This is the one place on the internet we should all be free and comfortable to express our creativity/beliefs/weird experiences. 

Whichever way you look at it, we are talking about escape through some kind of growth. The only way out I can see is liberation through the hard, laborious work of meditation. See you on the other side!

They'll get it, eventually.

It's a school.

The thing about this theory...  *so what?*If we are in a simulation, so what?  Nothing we can do about it; code can‚Äôt leave the computer.  If we are all simulated the eternal soul and any meaning is just another bit of programmed illusion.  If we are in a simulation, you don‚Äôt mean anything, I don‚Äôt mean anything, there isn‚Äôt some ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù there isn‚Äôt enlightenment, there is no point because none of any of these mean anything to code.If we are replayed again and again, so what?  It is just absurdity and pointlessness.I am not even saying you are wrong, just that if you are right it *means nothing*. But, to be honest this just seems like some non-religious version of the same scared hope that there is ‚Äúsomething‚Äù beyond and that when we die it isn‚Äôt just all over.  A religion for the non-religious.  It is just fear and hubris.

Well, it's not *"fake"*, but it definitely is a simulation. Sure, everything in regards to this life is illusory and the result of the interference pattern of a universal wave function. Nothing of this life is "fundamental" to reality. We're the surface ripples on a pond - constantly changing. But does that make it all fake? Not necessarily. The emotions I feel are real. The interactions I have in life are real. Everything I go through in this life - in its own respect - is real. It has something tangible and useful that you can take from it. It might just be a big LARP as we souls roleplay in these bodies, but most people have forgotten that. Most people are playing as if this is the real thing, so in that regard, as far as most people are concerned, this reality is real. It might be a simulation among an infinite number of others, but that doesn't make it any less real. It just means there's an infinite number of alternative realities and other ways that "real" can represent itself. 

As someone who knows the truth, is funny how accurate this matrix analogy is to what is actually happening, its just not code and an outside world but instead it‚Äôs the quantum fabric of the universe and various fractal levels of consciousnesses  attempting to move closer to own origin of the universal consciousness just as we are attempting to reach enlightenment back to our own global conciseness. 

Meh. I have these super psychic dreams where I'm basically God. Lucid / omnipotent. They happen a few times a year. The last one I had I sucked back into the ultimate reality. It was very fun *to do* because of the power / privilege involved in seeing the fundamental structures of our reality vanish and a feeling of wisdom come over me. But then, I was just alone. Alone in the absolute void with no personality. I decided it was boring and hellish and "fell back asleep" and the entire universe constructed itself again and I quickly fell back into my sleeping body. I knew everything was a simulation, like leaves on the branches of me being the tree, but I didn't care. It was better to be living and dumb than filled with wisdom and alone. Maybe I'm just flawed or not ready.

Link? 

Sometimes I think everyone is an npc. Sometimes I think I am. Sometimes I think I'm just observing, even though I believe I'm participating. Sometimes I think different consciousnesses are using my identity one after the other, and each one assumes all my memories once they take control of my body, so that my reality is all they know (and all I know). The possibilities are endless; there is no way of knowing. 

perhaps it wasn't my choice

interested to hear your take - where am I getting it wrong?

Don't worry - I don't get angry about this stuff. I love talking about it, and always looking for different perspectives. I don't think any of us know anything for sure. I don't think the brain is involved though - that is part of the "old" body, the dead carcass we are leaving behind. I think our consciousness is freed from this mortal vehicle that we call "the body" and we take on another form. The new form (or old form - predating our earthly existence) is the more permanent form, and (according to NDE survivors) appears to be just as solid as the body you are in now. As far as walking towards light, or frequency ranges or whatnot - I would imagine that what you say is perhaps true, as everything seems to be frequency... but it doesn't really address the central thrust of what I'm getting at, which is that the whole process of reincarnation is a giant con-trick on humanity. Always open to hearing more thoughts tho.

Or it's modern aero-innovation...

I just googled 747 and they seem to still be under the wing. Where are you seeing them?

That's the tendency to see faces when there aren't any.   It's a natural human thing. 

Looks like actual people in motion. The famous Gettysburg video shows what looks like people trekking up a hillside and into the treeline. But when you really look you see that those images repeat and it looks like lights from traffic somewhat close by. The duplicate consistency of each wave of 'soldiers' definitely tracks as car headlights going around a curve that's on a hill, common in the area.

If ghosts are a thing then we can harvest their energy. There is no such thing as a free lunch according to the conservation of energy. If ghosts are real then we can use them to power our cars. Also whats the advantage here from an evolutionary standpoint? What about ghosts gives a species an advantage over other competitors?

Two things going on here. We can recreate an out of body experience by either suffocating your brain for abit or with a wee bit of DMT. Guess what chemical your brain releases in your sleep and guess what happens when you are dying? Thats right low O2 and the release of DMT. As for the anecdotal thing about the the house... Come on. If there is an afterlife God is a cunt for fucking with your mum like that. Hey pssst your uncle bought a house.... THis will fuck her world up when he calls tomorrow lol. Im killing myself. 

I don't know if I believe in ghosts or not, but if I did, I think the idea of ghosts being your whole spirit has always been too idealistic to be real.I see ghosts more as Death Imprints. They're your strongest thoughts and emotions from the moment you died, given life as accidental thought forms by the last of your energy exiting your body. The Imprint left behind on the world is no more "you" than the corpse in the ground.And unless the Imprint is consistently fed more energy, I think it makes sense that it would eventually fade from existence altogether.

lmao are you for real? I hope not cos that would be very very very sad

Hello. I am so exceptionally experienced with this at this point, I can clearly say it was not a dream.

I have seen that film. It was excellent. Fantastic cinematography, and tom waits is very cool.

OR he died in one dimension but continued living in the infinite amount of others. 

 

I have watched several of these. A very good study. 

You say "the" afterlife, but which one? 

Why do you say that?

Thanks!!!

Zak Bagans did a documentary that‚Äôs been uploaded on YouTube called the Demon House. It‚Äôs...something 

Myself and "Jane" were in the elevated dj booth overlooking the dance floor. "John" was way across a packed nightclub. He had his back to us, and you could not hear 10 feet away from you it was so loud. John was an enormous distance from us. I told Jane we need to get John to hang out. She agreed. Jane said come up here with us, silently in her mind. John immediately said: o.k. I will be right there. He then turned around and waved.

Yeah that's true. Frame of mind, mood and setting are hugely important. It also helps to have a friend who stays more or less sober to baby sit your ass if you take a alot.

It has indeed been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  It's just that that proof continues to be denied by TPTB, and since the 99% allow themselves to be lead like blind rats by what TPTB say is and is not true, we've allowed ourselves to be convinced that the negations of TPTB must mean "the existence of paranormal phenomena hasn't been proven".Little could be further from the actual truth.Heck, the very fact that you yourself understand that there have indeed been millions (*millions*) of accounts is almost proof positive in itself.  You don't have "a million" of ***anything*** and the thing in question not actually exist.

 

I'm curious in what ways you can combat these dead LEO's.   There must be more that can be done.  What compels their allegiance?  Are they human? 

She seems pretty poor I suspect she couldn‚Äôt afford to move

I mean, who even believes in demons lmao kid's probably just having some mental breakdown or something. The human body is quite powerful when on Adrenaline - see the "super humans".

Yeah, that link is to show you what people will say, I realize it was Gary but I guess I wanted to express that Chip told me that those who are possessed like being possessed, you explained you have to want to be possessed to be possessed.

Interesting. Several stories of dying patients seeing a black thing floating above them trying to take them.

Great Link!  I read a lot of these one rainy October while alone in my office and scared myself so bad, I had to leave and go be around people for a while.  

Eeeek too creepy. I read a few but need to sleep tonight! 

cool thanks

My mother is not a nurse but works at a hospital, I've heard stories of her having to calm down a demon possessed woman, crazy intense ish. 

I'm glad it's awesome! First time I started floating out of my body, I was like NOPE! Take your time, capture what you can, no rush. Don't be afraid to tell your story and ask for help. I have a hunch that if you ask around, most folks will help you if they can. :)

Sorry for the late reply myself haha, but to give you my answer I honestly don't know. It could be a number of places. It could simply be a place that your subconscious mind has put together, out of the accumulation of different places it's seen in the past, as a setting that it thinks is suitable for your conscious mind to go while dreaming. It could be a real city here on earth that you're going to and that you're aware of via some psychic phenomena or past life connection. It could be a place that exists, not on this earth, but on a parallel version of it in an alternate reality.  That's the best explanation I can offer for you. Sorry it can't be more, but if you want to share any further details like what this place looks like, the layout, how you feel there etc, things like that might help determine what/where this place is. 

The reason I know this is, they actually have my EEG recorded while this was happening. I knew certain things about my visitors who were vacationing at my home and I was really stressed and it actually showed up on the EEG. It is only years later and doing minimal research that I now understand what is going on.

This fits in very well, and yes if certain chunks of the brain get shut down that form that barrier, that embodiment, it's totally possible that you become more aware of other people's energies around you.I'm actually willing to venture and say that putting yourself in sensory deprivation (already shown to increase your senses) while tripping butt (using for example DMT) inside [these](https://youtu.be/8j9uHyDSH0s) coffins (acting as insulation pretty much) might allow the layperson to do similar things in terms of manipulating the embodiment chunks of the brain... maybe allowing you to feel outside your skull.

I will thank you.

Same. My intuition is on steroids, too. I will just "know" things with the confidence I would have, if it happened yesterday.It totally changed my life and I now consider it a gift.

>I didn't die or w/e but I was in this pitch black voidFrom what I understand of consciousness and death,  upon crossing over most people temporarily experience what they subconsciously expect to experience because our consciousness creates our reality.   When you pass from this density,  your create your reality much more instantaneously, because you are then nothing but consciousness.  It can take much "time" for a person who has died to realize that the limiting afterdeath environment they created for themselves isn't exactly real.  I think I've experienced the void you're  referring to, though.  I used to experiment with mega doses of Saliva Divinorum. I would do it ritualistically, asking for specific information before dosing and have extremely vivid visions beyond compare with anything else I've ever experienced. One evening,  I asked for insight into the nature of time,  and how we fit into it as human beings.  Upon dosing I was swept away to a void. I could FEEL within every bit of me the emptiness of this void.  I was so alone and aching for interaction and change and I then "knew" (was told) that this was a demonstration of our inability to change our spiritual evolutionary path when we are non-physical.  We can think and ponder and plan and imagine,  but we can't CHANGE anything.   Change and evolution of our spiritual being can only occur in the 3D realm (in our bodies).  We have to grow and expand and change things HERE, because when you go to the other side you lose your ability to manipulate your path and go into a kind of Idling Mode where you reflect on WTF just happened and how it affects your path. The Void isn't where we will end up in death,  it is just an aspect of it which can be used to teach. I came back from the vision imbued with an insane appreciation for the people around me.  I stood up off the floor and immediately went down the hall to interact with some people I previously didn't really like,  because we are here exactly for that. I felt an amazing upswell of love for these guys who were basically previously-unliked-aquaintances and I do my best to keep in mind that the transformations we make to our soul in every single face-to-face interaction with real people is exactly why we are here. We come here specifically for interactions with other souls in chemical clothes because we gain something from playing out the interactions here that we don't over there; every interaction is precious, even with people we think we despise.  We get to the other side and find out they were teachers merely providing needed resistance for your spiritual muscles to grow.

Nothingness  isnt actually a thing. Even the dark void with no particles or space is still a thing./concept. Explain to me what absolute nothingness is.

Just the thought of nothingness. So lonely.Not trying to give you a hard time or  demean your experience.   That must have been extremely frightening. 

Duuuuuuuuhhhhhhh!!!!

sounds like somethibg from a /r/dmt trip

Then that will be your truth. You are the creator of your universe.  But that doesnt mean that's the truth for everyone.  You think your experience disproves the afterlife?  No.  There are hundreds of thousands of experiences that say otherwise.  You think yours negates theirs? No. No sane or logical thinker is going to take your experience and ignorantly assume that your experience is the only true experience.  There is too much evidence against it.  There are more people having NDE's compared to those having blank/nothingness.  The numbers are against you. For all anyone knows you may not remember and had a full-on NDE.  Have you considered regressive therapy/hypnosis?  It may reveal to you that something else happened during that moment.  You can literally go back to that exact moment.  I would consider it. But I digress.  As I said initially you are the Creator of your existence.  What you believe is what you get.  If you believe there is nothing then there will be nothing FOR YOU. 

Correct

It be very impressive if he did. 

You got it. Hail yourself 

Yeah sure! Might be another day or two, but I'll be sure to reply or PM with results. Even if I dont feel or remember anything odd.I totally tried earlier today, but this *really* annoying ass bird in my backyard ruined any and all attempts at meditation. I can only hope a cat eats it overnight!

Sorry I'm super late on this! But I wasn't able to get into as deep a meditation as I would like to to try this until last night.I did exactly as described. Went backwards, year by year, through my life, with an emphasis on sexual partners and experiences. I also tried to make sure I focused on the very emotional memories and parts of my life.I'm actually going to try this again as soon as I can, to see if I can get anything else because I have no idea if what happened is.. well, relevant or just something my brain did randomly. If that makes any sense.Anyway.. after doing all of the above.. I "saw" either dust, dirt, or smoke (not sure which) billowing towards me. I didn't "feel" like I was or had been another person, but it also wasn't any memory of mine that I can remember.It actually spooked/shocked me when it happened and I immediately opened my eyes without thinking. Almost as if someone had thrown dirt in my face in real life as I was meditating since I'm *far* from experienced enough to continue meditating if disturbed.It was pretty weird because I visualize a lot of things with my eyes closed while meditating, and usually not consciously. But I've never had closed-eye visuals snap me out of focus like that before.So, I'm still really intrigued and will be experimenting further.Sorry it wasn't something more interesting! (I'm just going to copy and paste the link to this reply to others who have asked for an update :))

I finally got around to trying. Here's my reply!: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8n8s74/rconspiracy_round_table_14_ghosts_possessions/e0ls58u

Naw, it's actually far simpler than holorfractal (as a more correct description of our universe should be) if curious it's called Tetryonics by Kelvin Abraham. What makes it different than others is that it yields things like a 3d periodic table which you can use like Lego blocks to build up from, from elements to functional groups to amino acids and nucleotides to proteins and DNA etc etc yielding the correct measured atomic structures (using things like CryoEM or x ray crystallography).The theory is testable and explains things like quantum entanglement simply, and in an intuitive manner (not mathemagical)

That theory is definitely not mine and the theory explains physics and all the building blocks to go from the bottom up, what can be made with it is anyone's guess... but it definitely lays the groundwork for understanding that we might already be part of a bigger whole (which is super exciting imo)

Randi is an agent. He actually works for the brutally sadistic forces that seek to enslave humanity.http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/topic/21448-the-less-than-amazing-randi-critic-of-9-11-truth-is-funded-by-military-contractors/

Interesting.  Like I said, I am not merely calling ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù on it, rather, I naturally look for every rational explanation first before considering something like that can be ‚Äúreal‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt believe in these things and think there is some trick to them, but I would love to be proven wrong!

But if they are actual people, do you need to interact with them in order for them to do it? 

Lmao

 

Is it escape or pushing past it, pushing past bullshit that others project on to you?

of rock?

I do not look for the "beyond". By **waking up** we can actually **take control of the simulation**, as that is what was originally **meant to be**. Unfortunately we **fell asleep**...

God would be an upgrade. A bit like going from Windows XP to Windows 10. Hell would clearly be Windows ME

One day you're gonna find the code to get out. Hopefully, because this world is bullshit. 

So if it is a simulation, do we simply cease to exist if the simulation was put to an end? Or can we be extracted from the simulation and put into a real world?

it's not fake if pain hurtsthe creator of the fake world is not benevolent and is not some shepherd of humansat best it's a 'throw at the wall and see what sticks' type experiment, at worst it's an out of control chain reaction. uni- means single, whatever you can reach from our universe is still part of this universe.  there is no way for something to exist at the same time that is not connected to this universe, there could however be a sequence of universes with discrete beginnings and ends.    

Me too. I know certainly that I have traveled in my sleep to an alternate reality that might be more real than my conscious existence today. I know I feel more soulful emotion there that I cannot attain in this bullshit everyday here on this earth because no matter where I go on this marble, there I am. And I'm never really happy. Only when I traverse the other realm do I feel I've had a genuine experience. Weird I know. üò¶

The **NPC** theory is discussed quite a bit in the glitchinthematrix sub. Basically people all over the world are seeing robotic acting people, who do repeating events that make no sense. 

If it helps you to understand, it's kinda more like a video game go out and explore it, unlock some levels. Go fuckin' party your ass off, go be a ramblin' hobo. If some cruel God has trapped us in here it sure as shit might piss them off if you act happy about it.

Perhaps, but do you really wanna spend the rest of your time in "the simulation" thinking about it that way.

It is a con. I am very upset by so much that we are "taught". Just like Adam and Eve, God's son and daughter, get it? Okay, so we are taught incest then we have Lilith, who is completely NOT taught to the Catholics, I should know, I was forced to be one as a child. Albeit they wanted me out as soon as I "graduated" CCD, I raised my hand all the time with questions, had I known about Lilith, why I would of raised my hand even more. It is all a big hand job to get you to be a slave and not ask questions. As soon as you stop taking the Fluoride, Choloform water, which helps you get sick so they can help you by giving you drugs that still keep you sick, but you can live, just not feeling too good while living.. Sick ass shit, so yeah, it is a con.

 

In front of the wing. 

Wanna have fun? Go on Google earth and check out Centralia PA and the old highway. You'll see so many faces. What do you think of the flashlight reviewer who recorded those bizarre noises in the cave (not the moving chain industry noise dude). On kindle I'll look it up.Why do you think we still see faces and do you think autism has an effect on that particular pattern recognition? Do people who receive sight later in life experience pareodilia?

Harvesting ghost energy would likely not be economically feasible.  This isn't "ghost busters" you can't trap and store them.  Even if you could, they likely wouldn't produce enough energy to power anything.  

> Also whats the advantage here from an evolutionary standpoint?> What about ghosts gives a species an advantage over other competitors?With so much of the spiritual reality unknown, it could be any number of things. Maybe they can impart knowledge and wisdom to younger generations in dreams, or through other methods. Alternatively, maybe ghosts act as scarecrows to non-human malevolent spirits (what some might call "demons") who might wish to harm people, warding them away from human populations.Or maybe there is no advantage at all. Maybe it's a side-effect to another advantageous trait. Say, humans having some ability to slightly manipulate reality through focus or strong emotions (magick)... When we die, we just naturally expel the last of our magickal energy, creating a Death Imprint/Ghost.

That is a creepy concept.  Sounds like a Black Mirror episode.

Yes, taking DMT can invoke an out of body response from your consciousness. Do you deny that this is real? Or are you just playing it down to "just tripping"?  Discovering the link between DMT and the way it interacts with a beings consciousness could be the key to building a model for the way consciousness acts beyond the body. It's no coincidence that people most often experience out of body experiences on DMT, living their lives from birth to death, and "breaking through" to higher dimensions at high doses. DMT allows you to remove your consciousness from the confines of the body and temporarily experience existence beyond it, but from the perspective as the "you" that you are at the point in time when taking the chemical. 

>We can recreate an out of body experience by either suffocating your brain for abit or with a wee bit of DMT.>Guess what chemical your brain releases in your sleep and guess what happens when you are dying? Thats right low O2 and the release of DMT.How do you explain that she could describe the scene when she was saved by the lifeguard in vivid details, exactly as they happened? 

You‚Äôre either ignorant or brain dead why would loosh energy be a bs concept if a cia veteran with 30+ years of experience discussed it on multiple yt videos, he worked on various government operations he knows they used to abduct children and one of their experiments involved loosh, I used to think it was a wacko conspiracy but a whistleblower with credibility ended up giving it merit, dont just write something off because you cant do proper research.

Astral travel to my place and kick out these demons then.

Ok. But these ar3nt normal dreams.

How does quantum afterlife account for old age?

Hi. You were declared "clinically dead", but the **Silver Cord** still remained. It actually pulled you back into the physical body and this dimension.

Your brain can live for up to 20-30 minutes after your heart "stops" before your neural synapses begin to break apart irretrievably. If you were truly dead, there would be no bringing you back.Some religions believe the soul does not depart from the body immediately. Others believe that your body and soul are indistinguishable, but that you "sleep" in your grave until such time that your body is supernaturally "resurrected" from the grave.Being passed out or flatlined for a few minutes does not genuinely constitute "death", and just because you did not have an experience while being "on the edge" doesn't invalidate what others claim to have experienced. It certainly doesn't "disprove" some form of after-life.But.. this is all just, like, my opinion, man.>The Edge...There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The others-the living-are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between Now and Later. But the edge is still Out there.   - Hunter S. Thompson

Also, check out this interview.  This guy died after being stung by some jellyfish.  His story is amazing it if you're like me, you can kind of tell when someone is lying.  When he starts crying talking about what happened it hits you in the gut.  He was an atheist when it happened.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO0O5PxFbeE

Just watched. Man that‚Äôs some crazy shit! 

The nature of a conspiracy behind holding this knowledge secret is conspiracy worthy. 

hi. what is a "leo"?

The leo's are large in number and are comprise two mind sets: One is those who are massively programmed (as all astral residents are) and have been cruelly manipulated to think the control group and the karmic system are beneficial. The other portion know the full shocking truth and choose to serve the sadistic predators who enslave us. 

But you can afford to spit babies out your vaginal opening. *Priorities*

She also probably paid off the folks involved. I have to admit it's a creative scam but then again she probably thought it was very real. It IS Gary, Indiana after all.

I saw the same thing in a dream once. It floated past me, stopped, turned to look at me for a few seconds, then turned away and continued on. 

That describes it perfectly! It takes a bit for certain concepts to take shape, but when they do its super exciting to understand something that before i was struggling to even get started on the very very basics. Sure i have to put in some ammount of work. But when you Instinctively understand something then its a breeze to go through the textbook and put names and equations to it. Socially im super isolated at the moment, but it actually doesnt bother me now.I wasnt an idiot before, but i really wasnt all that smart. And up until now i didnt realize that this new found laserlike focus kinda started happening after i died. So yeah, guess the me that came back aint exactly the same me that is here now...which my mom complains about sometimes. But hey, win some lose some :D

I wasnt lonely actually.I had my GF at my side, that took away all loneliness.  Besides that i was more dissapointed that there really aint nothing there. 

Uh Huuuuu!

Im as straight edge as they come, so nope :)

Every time I hear about Crowley the first thing that pops into my head is ‚Äúpower bottom‚Äù because of those clowns lol

I hope you remember being a bird eaten by a cat for that one.Maybe the bird was supposed to be squawking, synchronicity, just saying.I used to meditate in jail, inmates are loud..

This is a great bit of Alan Watts on meditation that has helped me to be able to meditate in noisy environments.  I always start by listening to the constant ringing in the background and expanding out from there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPpUNAFHgxM

Wow, I spend a fair amount of time on conspiracies and that's the first time I've heard anyone suggest that nuclear bombs are a lie. Didn't see much specific evidence, but I appreciated this quote from a user:>Most of the people the Skeptics attack are making money from more or less bogus claims. For example, 'psychic surgeons' in the Philippines make what appears to them a fortune from simple trickery. The people who pay them do it voluntarily. The audiences in spiritualist performances, or mind-reading acts, and the consumers of absurd 'flower' remedies or tablets with no active ingredients, are all more or less adults. Why shouldn't they pay their money? Most of the crits by Skeptics are of failed cults, or failing‚Ä¶ But 'Skeptics' don't criticise serious abuses of power. There's nothing much on Freemasons or Jews or Mormons or Catholics‚Ä¶ What about mass killings and chemical warfare in Vietnam? The 'Skeptics' said nothing. What about Coca Cola in the third world, where what they need is clean water? What about tobacco companies? What about NASA? What about the detail of science - the endoplasmic reticulum as a fraud, criticisms of immunology, the nonsense about 'AIDS'? What about 9/11? And what about nuclear issues, which this site is addressing? The 'Skeptics' attack in inverse proportion to the seriousness of the issue.

This article had more actual evidence than the one you posted earlier, thank you. Super interesting to read that the 9-11 commission report said the NSA didn't know that one of the hijackers whose calls they were intercepting was in the US. William Binney said there's no way they didn't know. So did they not share that info? Or did the FBI or CIA (not sure whose jurisdiction) ignore it?

 

They interact with you. No choice.

I agree with what he's saying here,  but I would add that a person first has to open themselves up to the possessing entity. If someone is possessed, I guaranfuckingtee they agreed to it on some level.  OP seems to have thought they were going to get goodies from negative entities and opened themselves up to their influence.  They gave permission.   

Not a joke. 

You can read about witch trials and Salem etc... Blocula etc... Alto of it is Satan/devil worship and yes there are real witches. They are forward about it. Look at Yoko Ono album names.  She just admits it.When you read about witch trials look at the accounts that the witches were charged from, not the emotional propaganda about what happened to the witches. Salem really happened and it still happens today. I always wanted to find the book Wonders of the unseen world by Cotton Mather. Im sure its erased from the internet for a reason.

Pushing past the bullshit is part of it, I would say.

If you control a ‚Äúsimulation‚Äù that is indistinguishable from reality, what makes it a simulation?  How is that not simply reality?  

God would be Windows 7, Windows 10 is Satan ffs.

My take is that if this world is bullshit, it is because too many people just want to ‚Äúget out‚Äù or escape in any method available to *themselves* rather than try to improve the only world *we all* have.If there is a way to ‚Äúget out‚Äù this is it, you don‚Äôt get out, you recreate this world.

By "simulation" I don't mean as in a computer-based simulation, but that reality (as we know it) effectively acts as a consciousness-based simulation due to it not being the only one. Let's say that this reality that we're currently experiencing exists at a particular "base frequency", or that things based in this reality generally act within a particular range of frequencies, so that they are able to definitively interact with other things based in these frequencies. But the thing with frequency is that it's a continuum. There is no end to the rate of frequencies on either end.  So, let's take for example the differences between rocks, water/air, and gamma radiation. The atoms that make up rocks vibrate at a relatively slow rate. It's what keeps the atoms in a fault uniform structure (depending on the rock) and stops the rock from melting at room temperature or running away by itself. The atoms that make up the cells of our skin have different vibrations. Generally they're faster, to allow for greater energy transfer between the atoms, and thus also between the cells. There's a relative fluidity to the skin, from the rocks perspective. At least with all those cells that carry out duties, die, then get replaced by other cells so quickly. But this higher frequency interaction, over the span of the entire skin organ, comes to form a pretty decent interference pattern which, from our human perspective, seems pretty solid. With air and water, their atoms again act at higher frequencies than both the atoms that make up the skin, and those of the rock. Between these three we can see that the immediate effect of the interactions between the rock and water or air are minimal. At least when you're taking the same amount of each and comparing them with each other, each as a whole, immediately. But if you look at their effects on each other on an atomic scale, or as whole but over an extended period of time, then you can see the fire extents of their effects on one another. Then we can look at gamma rays. Gamma rays are extremely high frequency electromagnetic radiation. We humans simply don't have the biological equipment to pick up gamma rays. Gamma rays normally go straight through us with no problem. We have no biological way to register them, despite the high frequency response of the atoms that make up our cells, because when the cells come together and form systems and organs the result is that the organs and systems that the cells and atoms comprise operate on/within a different set of frequencies to those that the individual cells/atoms do. The only way we even know that gamma rays exist is through technology. Since we don't have the biological equipment to register them we needed to create a new piece of equipment that could pick up on them.  So we can see that at the high end of things there exists phenomena which operate at frequencies that are too high for us to register in any natural way, yet still occupy the same space. That's an example of multiple realities existing on top of one another, yet due to their different "base frequencies" they don't directly interact with one another and generally will just do their own thing. Due to factthat one reality has no immediate effect on the other, then from the perspective of one of the realities, it would be like the other is effectively a simulation. Doesn't make it any less real, as it totally is real within its own right. But from either one perspective the other just doesn't necessarily matter as it has no "real" effect on their respective "reality".  In regards to your questions there, when we die we go to another reality. A higher dimension. The "you" who you were in this life doesn't cease to exist, as there's the data to prove that that respective existence existed through time and space. You could trace your path from death back to birth with the right equipment. But the "you" that exists now isn't just the you that you were in that life. You "remember" that you are the culmination of all the different lives you've lived *on top of* the most recent life you've lived. It's sorta like coming out of a video game and remembering that that video game you wasn't the real you, but just one expression, and that you are the culmination of all the video game characters and games you've ever played *as well as* all the stuff that was going on between playing video games.  Reality is subjective, yo. 

It is weird. Sometimes I'll "remember" a glimpse of an emotion that I felt in a dream recently, almost like a fraction of a memory although I can never seem to remember what it was that happened in the dream to make me feel that way. It's like something in my life triggers an emotional response that reminds me of an extremely strong emotion that I know I felt in a dream previously. Emotion isn't even the right word really it's more like an underlying state of mind that we don't have the vocabulary to describe or the capacity to relate to our everyday lives in order to consciously understand it. Yet I know with 100% certainty there was some "time" in a dream I had that I am being reminded of, even though I don't know what it was or how exactly I am being reminded of it.

 

Live and walk around in New York City (or any major city, for that matter) and you'll definitely think you are surrounded by NPCs.

Partying your ass off leads to drug addiction. Being a ramblin' hobo is not my idea of fun. Life is suffering. I want out. Meditation is possibly the only way. 

Only if you know you are golden. I'm 50 and an ex crackhead. You gotta know you're place and roll. It's harder than you think my friend. And I'm a chick too; a true survivor üòã

I want to get out of the simulation. I think that the only way is through meditation. 

We absolutely live in a **Simulation**. It is a **Loosh Energy Farm** controlled by the Global Elite and **Aliens**

It is absolutely true that aircraft can have multiple configurations that all work.   It depends on the plane's purpose.   As far as conspiracy goes in this line,  i believe the US probably figured out anti gravity of some kind displayed in the flying saucers; and has been using it for awhile. 

There are a ton of different planes with engines in different places...  Cessna?  OMG! on the front of the plane!  Gulfstream?  WTF!?  They are on the tail!!  B-52?  Under the wing... **boring**!  Jet fighters (of many types) HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE ENGINE IS THE FUCKING FUSELAGE!!!

 

>  Or are you just playing it down to "just tripping"?Im playing it down to "The chemistry in your brain is so out of whack it produces altered states" >DMT allows you to remove your consciousness from the confines of the body and temporarily experience existence beyond it, but from the perspective as the "you" that you are at the point in time when taking the chemical.Ive done DMT and it certainly has a long term meaningful effect on your body and brain. Hallucinating shuts down most of you brain and elevates activity in the default mode complex.

"The Edge...There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The others-the living-are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between Now and Later. But the edge is still Out there.- Hunter S. Thompson"Righteous quote, man!

Law enforcement officers.   I'm just perplexed that the afterlife is plagued with more peons "just following orders".

I woke up one time in the middle of the night & saw a black cloud floating over me

Yes! I have weird flashes of things that are far beyond my level of learning. Recently, I saw the structure of space and time,wish I had the math to adequately explain it.A gift it may be, but it's also hard freaking work!

Reminds me of Stranger Things. There is nothing, it's all black but there are still "things" *living* there - when Eleven goes to the Upside Down world/dimension.

I know right? However, having done some research into Thelema and Crowley before coming across the podcast it's pretty apt.

If it makes you feel any better, I totally whispered "just kidding little buddy! dont get eaten!" after I posted that.

Oh man, I just saw this. Thank you!I usually meditate at night, so I generally don't have too many problems.But there are times when I'd like to meditate during the day without resorting to earplugs, lol. I'll definitely give the video a watch. :)

Hey! I tried again and here's my reply: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8n8s74/rconspiracy_round_table_14_ghosts_possessions/e0ls58uIt was an odd and unusual experience, different from when I usually meditate but I'm not sure if what happened was actually relevant or just a random occurrence.

Endoplasmic reticulum is a lie?  What do you mean? 

Interesting, thanks!

"They especially love penises and bungholes" sure, not a joke

 

Me too.. 

it is reality. it just does not have any existence when not being observed.

Good point. ME is satans mother then :) 

Good point. It's just pretty hard to beat the people pulling the strings. 

Badass breakdown 

Hey. I was a ramblin hobo too!Nice to meet another person from the bus :)

If it is a simulation, there is no way out.  You are code and this completely trapped.Not much point to it.

You think well. :)

Upvote for Loosh.  Not many know that term.

It isn't so much a simulation.  We live in the 3rd dimension, which is a low vibrational frequency.  We aren't able to manifest reality very well in a low vibrational state.  Thus it's easier to "trick" spirits into certain ways of thinking and believing here.  And yes the Elites and aliens are working together to keep us here but they can't FORCE us to.  They can only trick us into agreeing to stay.  And a lot of us are fooled.The most important thing every person needs to understand is that NOTHING IN ALL OF EXISTENCE can harm you.  And I promise you that this is 100% correct.  You cannot ever be forced to do anything.  You choose what happens to you and ONLY you.  

Without a doubt they work. I wasn‚Äôt disputing that at all. But I have flown many planes and they all had the engines under the wing not pointing out the front. 

If the point has already been made by another user, your needless mockery adds nothing to the conversation.  If you don't have anything nice or useful to say then just keep your mouth shut. 

Sorry for such late reply, but I get what you mean. When I was 8 years old I entered a ceramic draft horse in the Lake County Fair (IL).  OK see I just typed out a paragraph about my experience with that but deleted it because it didn't contribute so yeah.  Anyway. My entry won 1st Place and Best of Show so my aunt called me and said, "General, hang on to your hat!" And all I could do was reach onto my head where my Marriott's Great America visor rested, and said anxiously, "Which ONE??!!"  I did not understand metaphor, turns of phrase or any linguistic tricks as I expected adults to be direct and that there would be dire consequences if I did not, indeed, hang on to the correct hat. Perhaps my green plastic visor was the hat referred to and it somehow was worth a lot of money because Shaun Cassidy touched it? Or because one of the Banana Splits wore it as they slid down the slide in the intro to their show? Who KNOWS?   I have been drinking sorry.

Not really, my grandma told me the same thing. But anyway, you have the right to be skeptical.

I have a cat next to me right now. There still here it seems.

I went too deep into the Astral, for too long, on one of my visits and could feel the cord pulling me back into our reality.http://astralhq.com/the-silver-cord/

Hi. It is very sad. They are all over the place in the afterlife and do whatever they are told: Which is keep the deceased in their place. They also go nuts when they see a living person speaking with a deceased one. 

How big was it? Did it have a shape?

Well, thats my choice personally, learning the math is as you said the tough part. But it aint impossible, so thats what i am doing. Got quite a few products already lined up and they basically just need some last minute math and i need to save up the money for patents, but my employer may got me covered on that front, so that means "only" the math. I keep everything very hush hush, because if i do tell people, they would declare me either crazy or a fraud, nothing is more real then reality and thats why I say go for it. Its super rewarding translating those abstract concepts in real life prototypes and devices.

Did you end up trying again?

Just quoting the other site. That one made me all ?!? as well. 

Okay anuses. Im not kidding you.

Wasnt as good as I thought it was gonna be.

 

Agreed.  And Apple, well obviously that is the snake in the garden lol

Well that is because you won‚Äôt beat them at their own game, the wining condition is to stop living in their reality and create another one.

Hi. I am glad to see someone else understands. This link below is for those who are unfamiliar with the horrific truth: We are enslaved to produce **Loosh Energy**http://www.theeventchronicle.com/galactic/archons-parasites-loosh/#

You might be thinking of the 737-1xx/2xx which had the underwing (pod) style JT8D low bypass turbofans, they were incredibly loud and inefficient and didn't stick out very far Infront of the wing. Which lead to them changing to the forward strutted CFM56 highbypass in the 737-300/500/700 model.The reason you haven't seen them is because there are virtually zero flying anymore. I know this is old as but yeeah, it ain't a conspiracy.

It is funny to me and the friends I read it to as I wrote it :DAnd the idea was fucking stupid, just because you never looked at an airplane doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúthey‚Äù changed it.  Mandela effects are stupid, people making a ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù out of their failure to notice things or know correct spelling.  It makes actual theorists look stupid and is total disinfo.  (If there *is* any conspiracy to it, it would be that ME is a constructed meme to disorient people with false info and make them not notice things that really happen; to make everything seem like misinfo.  You are being *primed* buddy.)

Is sleep paralysis related to this? I've had it twice and each time I'm about 4-7 feet away from where I'm laying down and then I zip right back to my original spot, full of sweat. First time my teddy was floating above me, the second time my ceiling fan was moving to the right while I was getting pulled to the left. Both lasted about 5-10 seconds, I couldn't move or yell but I was trying. Bed soaked in sweat both times.

All I remember is that it was like a small black cloud.. it happened a very long time ago. I remember that I was more confused than scared. 

I used to hate math so much, I'd die rather than learn it. Now I have died, I'm voluntarily learning it. A true rebirth.I thought I was making my " knowing" up until I told my husband one of them, and it then happened. I tell him every time now, so I have a backup.Personally, I had to admit it's really happening, because it is. I don't care if someone thinks I'm insane, as that's what I was like, before.

I did! I replied above.Here's the link to my reply: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8n8s74/rconspiracy_round_table_14_ghosts_possessions/e0ls58u

Yeah if anyone figures out what they mean please tell me. I feel everything I learned in Biology was a lie.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkAwxeI6ucQ check it out at 3:10 (seriously).

It‚Äôs not a conspiracy. What‚Äôs a conspiracy and the biggest one I‚Äôve encountered is the mandela effect cover up. You may know that engines point out in front but bet many people you know don‚Äôt. Just ask them. This is one you can find out yourself. Just ask people where thy recall Statue of Liberty being. Liberty island or Ellis island. Many will think Ellis. Or what does the thinker statue look like. Or American gothic painting.  Is it looney tunes or looney toons ?  Fabreeze/ febreeze or febreze.  What does the ford logo look like ? Has the Coca Cola logo looked like that since 1913 ?  What colour is the A team van ? Do they recall John Goodman dying ? Did Mickey Mouse have braces ? Just look for yourself and ask. There are thousands. Some will know things as they are. But many will recall things as they were. And all in the same wrong way. 

If you're purely taking the piss just so you can read your own comment out to your friends for a laugh to make you look popular then why go for the one that's obviously a poor theory? Like, the theory itself being a poor one is plainly obvious to anyone reading. Your commentary adds nothing other than making others think: "Wow... Great... You can make fun of an idiot. What next?! Gonna go tell a flat earther that the earth is round? You must be so clever."  Get over your ego. There's no need to needlessly open your mouth and add nothing when the issue speaks for itself just fine. 

I‚Äôve flown all over the world. The engines are pointing out the front of the wing. You on the other hand have hardly been on a plane. I can tell, so feel free to mock as it‚Äôs the easiest thing in the world to do with the ME as now it‚Äôs always been like that and you are of course right.  But for me the engines used to be under the wing not pointing out front. 

sounds like you are phasing in and out of the body.

Funny, the thing I saw was a small black cloud too, maybe the size of a soccer ball or a little bigger. 

I don't really care about any of that. I'm just pointing out the reason you don't see underslung pod style engines on B737s anymore.

That is almost fair...  sometimes I browse reddit and something makes me laugh out loud and have to explain...  the ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù of plane engines was such a thing.I will admit it was more asshole than constructive, *mea culpa*!

The engines on 747‚Äôs, to my recollection (and I have never paid it much attention) have always been on a forward-angled strut beneath the wing, and that is confirmed by photos.  Of course, if you know anything at all about aerospace engineering, the engine and wing design is *the primary area of optimization for flight* meaning the fuselage doesn‚Äôt change much but the orientation of the engine struts do.  Mostly this would not be readily discernible except from blueprints.Also, please!  Tell me how many times I have been on an airplane, lol!Is that some measure of *sophistication* or *intelligence* or *coolness* to you!?  Or do you presume to learn about aviation engineering by *osmosis*; the more time you spend on an airliner the more you suddenly know about them?  How much time have you spent on a sailing yacht?  Bullet train?  Hot air ballon?  Lmao, I am not sure how to even calculate whatever *pissing contest* you seem to implying with that.  You are not from the first world maybe?  Being on an airplane impresses your people?  Maybe you are the first in your village to obtain passage on the *metal bird*!?The humorous part is that I have not spent a great deal of time on commercial airliners, yet I have a friend who is an enthusiast pilot and has a private plane and I have spent a good amount of time on pleasure flights and have taken the controls on multiple occasions.  How does that one compare in your worldview?

That's what a girl told me, but my mind realizes half way through and pulls me back. Idk any of this stuff though

R u a highly sensitive person? I think ghosts target sensitive ppl more

Sure there are reasons. But I most certainly recall many planes having engines under the wing and no pointing forward. Though strange you don‚Äôt care history changes and you don‚Äôt notice. But hey that‚Äôs cool. 

The humerus part is that you have not spent a great deal of time on commercial airliners. Yeah I know that‚Äôs why I said it. Wasn‚Äôt trying to have a pissing contest. It‚Äôs just an observation. As it happens I have and I recall very vividly never seeing the engines petruding like that. Engines work under the wing or petruded  forward. I‚Äôm not debating whether it works or not. We‚Äôve seen engines work in the tail and all sorts. Thrust and speed are the important factors. It‚Äôs just for many the engines were under the wings that is all. Anyway here‚Äôs stuff you haven‚Äôt heard of Ribbon sealsRainbow treesRainbow mountains Saiga antelopeOkapi Gremlin monkeys Purple tarantulas And the little piggy tail in the ford logo. Well if you have heard of any not before 2016.  Now am I psychic ? Or is something else going on ? 

you may have a talent for out of body travel. you should do significant research on the subject. robert monroe wrote 3 incredible books that will be a great place to start.

I've no idea how to judge that really. Maybe? How does one find out?

I have been an avid aviation nut my whole life, it's pity you don't know the models of these aircraft because I'd be able to tell you exactly what you are seeing. You are just remembering wrong. This is well documented and researched phenomena of the brain.

Okapi, is that a Japanese mythical creature?What is your point with that list?  I am not going to bother searching those, are ‚Äúrainbow trees‚Äù the common name for some species or is that something else?  There are a fuck ton of trees any person on earth has not heard of, are you familiar with *malcura pomifera*?  Anyway, *Phinnaeus Fog*, I suppose you have spent more time on commercial airlines, what is your point?Btw:  ‚Äúthe humerus [*sic*] part‚Äù is a bone in your arm but I know what you meant ;)Edit:  looked up a few of those for kicks, dunno what the animals are supposed to prove, like I said there are a million kinds of animal who‚Äôs common names I don‚Äôt know off the top of my head, the *Rainbow Mountians* however, I have heard of and seen pics of for years (probably because I am in the US instead of the UK and photos of the Americas are obviously more common here) usually I have heard them called the more common ‚ÄúPainted Mountains‚Äù though.

downloaded the audio files that change your frequency (done on a study group at a university?), just never got to it yet as my last years have been tough with my fathers cancer. Idk if I should try while I'm not at my best. The past months have been good though and I'm back in shape. Someone else has said the same, any suggestions to begin with?

I for instance am an empath, I can feel anyone's energy in a room, half the time finish their sentences.. And just generally put myself in people's shoes very easily. You would definitely know if you were hypersensitive to energies 

Not if you see it happening. And no it‚Äôs not remembering wrong.   I‚Äôve seen things change first hand. Not remember. Raindrops keep falling on my head ?  Nope. That‚Äôs another fine mess you got me into ? Nope. Did the little Austrian girl have braces when she rescued jaws in moon raker ? Nope. Did the witch say fly my pretties fly ? Nope. Did Oliver Twist say please sir, can I have some more ? Nope And where is kitt in knight rider ? Behind the steering wheel no one said. And what about rainbow trees. Where did those come from ?  But I‚Äôll leave you recall things as you like. But you don‚Äôt recall the Coca Cola logo always looking like that do you ?  Or field of dreams if you build it they will come ?  Anyway enough for now. 

We were talking about simulation theory. As for rainbow mountains they are in China. I‚Äôm not trying to show off I‚Äôm really not. Why would I know that you have t heard of most of those. Yet I name a couple of other obscure animals. Like the Mongolian fox. I‚Äôm pretty sure when you google it you‚Äôll recognise it. As for the mountains. I‚Äôve been in the Himalayas. Also. Atlas Mountains and up Kilimanjaro. I am no mountaineer but I love a trek and something different rather than sitting on a beach getting caned.  But I‚Äôd never heard of the rainbow mountains. Nor has anyone I know before 2016. And South America ? Bet it isn‚Äôt where you think it is.

You're rambling.

There are also ones in Peru.  When I googled it to verify, it comes back with those first.  Dunno.Also I haven‚Äôt specifically heard of the Mongolian fox any more than a ribbon seal, I mean I am not an avid ‚Äúanimal enthusiast‚Äù to know a ton of different species, lol, but do have an interest in dendrology and tree/plant identification.  My interest in that is particular to the USA so you could literally name *millions* of species of plants that I have never heard of.  I have seen pictures of those ‚Äúrainbow trees‚Äù but I couldn‚Äôt give an exact timeframe, I believe it was from search engine junk when looking for something specific, one of those ‚Äú10 amazing looking trees from around the world‚Äù type things.  Also listed was the *Amur Cherry* which is also rather wild looking.Btw:  there are apparently many [rainbow mountains](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/01/21/welcome-rainbow-mountains-peru/#1f42b7126f70)Also in [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Range_(Chilcotin_Plateau))Word to the wise, the more impressive photos are taken with filters to enhance the actual colors.Also, what do you mean about South America?  Are you referring to the *very common* mistake people unfamiliar with geography make in thinking it starts with the southern border of the USA?  (Common mistake of thinking ‚ÄúLatin America‚Äù means South America.  Lest you think I cheated, I live in Texas and this is not something I have to look up, btw.)

You‚Äôre not part of this sub really are you ?  

Interesting those mountains being in Canada as well. Wasn‚Äôt aware of that they crop up everywhere Fair point about nature. I was a bit of a closet nature geek to be honest. I‚Äôm referring to the common mistake most people have of South America being south of USA. Not south east.  [which one looks right to you ?](https://ibb.co/jKLD7d) Ok some specific USA questions.  Does Mount Rushmore look like you recall. Ie George Washington had that shirt ? Do you recall Statue of Liberty being on Ellis island ?Have you heard about the black Tom explosion ?Have you heard of the field of giant presidents heads ? Not sure how old you are but did you watch the A team and do you know the colour of the van ? And do you remember Mickey Mouse having braces ? Used to run his thumbs down his braces saying ‚Äúhello Pluto‚Äù Was it fruit loops or froot loops for you ?Do you remember John goodman dieing ? How long ago did robin Williams die ? They aren‚Äôt trick questions I would have got all of these wrong. The one that got me was six people in the car with JFK for me there was only four and I can tell you all about the driver William Greer. I have no clue about Roy kellerman and what he‚Äôs doing in the car. 

What... So because I don't align with your views I'm not part of this sub? I get into some conspiracies, most of them are fuckn nonsense though.

The South America thing I think is the effect of different map projections, most people are used to the Mercator one (whew, don‚Äôt ask how I remember that, lol, it is like 1066 William of Normandy, one of those things I remembered without ever trying).  Okay:Mount Rushmore, Washington always had a faint lapel outline but I am not sure if that is what you mean, I think he has a cravat also.‚ÄúLady Liberty‚Äù was always on Liberty island, immigrants went to Ellis island, *this is literally why immigrants in paintings and even ‚ÄúAn American Tail‚Äù the cartoon are looking across the bay to the Statue of Liberty*!  If the statue were on Ellis Island, they would be looking up her skirt!No clue about Black Tom.  Never heard of it.The A-team van was dark grey or black with an orange stripe.  Not old enough to watch it but a guy in my town has a replica of if.  (Or did he get it wrong!?)Don‚Äôt recall Mickey Mouse having braces ever.  Was this like a single cartoon short?  (Like the old ones where each cartoon was its own story and Mickey did all sort of different stuff?  I can easily imagine they may have made an episode where he has braces.)Was always ‚ÄúFroot Loops‚Äù common American marketing crap where it is misspelled.  The O‚Äôs on both Froot and Loop used pictures of the cereal.  I would imagine that any confusion is just that people have a built in ‚Äúspellcheck‚Äù that flils in crorect splelings aotumatically, like how you can read that with no problem!Field of President heads!?  Are you combining Mt. Rushmore with Easter Island!?  Never heard that one before.  (Sorry, out of order.)I met John Goodman randomly in New Orleans a few years ago at a restaurant!  I *have* heard of this Mandela Effect thing online before but that is the only place I know of hearing it.Seems like Robin Williams only died a year or two ago, but the way time flies I am guessing it was probably more like 5 or more.  Movies that came out in 2005 still seem ‚Äúrecent‚Äù to me, part of getting older?That‚Äôs is off the top of my head, you gotta tell me if I got the ‚Äúright‚Äù or not (or if I have false memories!)

Agree with that.  Though this one, unfortunately isn‚Äôt, in fact when you see it it‚Äôs not even a conspiracy.  I see many recoil from this until they see it. Oh and Mount Rushmore changed for many people. And no ones heard of the Great Wall of India. Or ribbon seals. Or bird eating trees.  Strange how I know that ?  

Robin Williams died in 2014. Four years ago. And yes all the others you are have got right. Though for me statue of Liberty was on Ellis island. I don‚Äôt know Mount Rushmore well enough. As for the a team van. It was always all black with a red stripe. I saw the same clip change from a black van to the one with a grey top.  As for South America. Ok the map thing. Just try and find any map at all that has it under the USA where many recall it ? There are literally hundreds. Though if you‚Äôre under 26 we seem to find you‚Äôll likely know what it is now than what many of us recall. We may be from different dimensions. Who knows. It‚Äôs very strange though. As for Easter island. Some of the statues now have hats. And the islander were not wiped out. I clearly recall the island being deserted when re discovered. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/what-43-decaying-president-heads-looks-180958129/

I still don't really care ae, sorry mate.

I am over 30.  I usually have a very sharp memory (like for random details more than for stuff I need to remember, so maybe it is all about perception?)I realized the South America thing, it looks like it is under the USA *on a globe*!  (Well angle is crucial, but the roundness makes the illusion, not the map projection so much.I remember the hats on Easter Island from some paranormal shows in the 90‚Äôs, the guy was trying to figure out the pattern or if the hats meant they were kings or something like that.  I *also* remember hearing that everyone left the island because they cut down all the trees to move the heads and the island became inhospitable!  (I *will* admit that reeks of some Aesop‚Äôs fable type thing about the folly of environmental damage so I wouldn‚Äôt be too shocked to learn it was an exaggeration.)Oh, the President‚Äôs head things is neat, never heard of it.  Reminds me of Russia (or that level on Goldeneye 007).Another thought about the ‚ÄúFroot Loops‚Äù thing:  it is particularly evident to me how this one started, *most people don‚Äôt carry on marketing misspellings when writing*.  I bet no mother writes ‚ÄúFroot Loops‚Äù on a grocery list, rather, ‚Äúfruit loops.‚Äù  This is likely why so many don‚Äôt realize the logo.  Just like a redneck I am writing about may drink a bud light but likely not a ‚ÄúBud Lite.‚ÄùOh, I thought of one, probably US specific...  it is actually a pet-peeve of mine when people misspeak the names of things (commonly adding a possessive ‚Äòs‚Äô to road names or store names ‚ÄúWalmart‚Äôs‚Äù as a pernicious example) and I can honestly envision *someone, somewhere* eventually trying to call this a Mandela Effect:  ‚ÄúSports Academy‚Äù when referring to ‚ÄúAcademy (sports and outdoors)‚Äù which is an American outdoor retailer.  It annoys the shit out of me, there is a store called ‚ÄúSports Authority‚Äù and there is ‚ÄúAcademy‚Äù but I have heard so many people say it this way.  As I said, just an odd pet-peeve, but *if* you ever come across it, remember you heard it here first!

Then don‚Äôt answer about the mandela effect then. Bye 

The Home Depot ? Or Home Depot. Staples logo. Ford logo. Volvo logo. ?Sounds to me like you have some explanations right off the bat.  I saw fruit loops change to froot loops. I saw Hilary Clinton change to Hillary Clinton. Australia didn‚Äôt used to be next to Papua New Guinea. As for Easter island I remember clearly a documentary as to where they could all have gone to. It was a mystery. Now they‚Äôve always been there. If you don‚Äôt see it then I guess you don‚Äôt see it. For some of us we have no choice it hits us hard and kinda shakes your world a little lol 

Remember when Walmart‚Äôs logo was a smiley face instead of an asterisk?  I dunno what the point of company logos changing is.

No nor me. Coca Cola gets me as well. I grew up with the logo having no dash or dot what ever it is.  It‚Äôs far reaching and even the human anatomy. Our heart has moved the liver got bigger. And we have bones behind our eye sockets. All very weird. 

Dunno that advertising is a valid thing... brands change their marketing constantly.  For example it was always ‚Äú*The* Home Depot‚Äù on the logo but their commercials used to simply say ‚ÄúHome Depot‚Äù.  Not a conspiracy, just different slogans.  Literally don‚Äôt know what you are getting at with the anatomy!  The heart?  It is always off-center to the left and slightly below the sternum.  Liver size?  Was the person a heavy drinker?  /s.I think this is an odd effect of people refusing to admit they are wrong about things and calling it a conspiracy instead.  Seems arrogant as fuck.Edit:  btw, still harping on the South America thing... *I know* that it always looked like it really is, not even optical illusion because it matches the shape of Arifca, where it broke apart.  I remember cutting out the shapes in elementary school when we learned about ‚ÄúPangea‚Äù and the teacher showing us how the continents fit together, just glanced at it again and remembered that.  If it were not further east, that wouldn‚Äôt work since Africa is shaped like an upside down ‚ÄúL‚Äù sort of.

Arrogance ?  If you were in any way open to this you‚Äôd ask for some proof. Some sort of evidence instead of calling me arrogant. As for brands. Don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs what we all thought at first. When I saw the dash in kit Kat had gone I assumed a re brand. Or the arrow in the Volvo logo. Or the vw sign being separate instead of one vw crossed in the middle. Or the ford logo with the pigs tail in it. ? Surely it‚Äôs arrogant to assume someone is lying to you and suggesting history algae changed without asking for proof. I‚Äôm not interested in convincing anyone. But you seem interested in convincing me I‚Äôm wrong. I just found out about zealandia today. Never heard of it or those two ridges that seem to come out the top of it.  Sri Lanka has also lived for me. And I live in the Uk and am Scottish. Before it was impossible to see Ireland from Scotland. Now you can.  You didn‚Äôt mention whether or not you were surprised at robin Williams death in 2014. How about Aretha Franklin is still alive ? Diana ross died for me about 12 years ago yet she‚Äôs still here. All very strange stuff. Re the Home Depot. I have family in the states. So whilst I may not know brands that well here for some reason American brands stick in the mind better maybe it‚Äôs because I just am more aware of my surroundings when in the states. But I don‚Äôt recall the Home Depot. Bit like I recall Jc penny and not jc Penney. 

I am not directly calling you arrogant, I am saying there is some arrogance in the entire idea ‚ÄúI am not *wrong*, they *changed the whole world*!‚ÄùSurely you can see the arrogance in that thought?I had to look up the Volvo thing, I thought you meant they *removed* the arrow, then I would have believed you since the Volvo logo has always been the male emblem!  That was the first car my parents had since I was alive and I remember it well, a 1980 240D with a standard transmission.  Are you saying you *didn‚Äôt* know it had an arrow!?Now the VW one, I know for a fact it has appeared with and without the little line dividing the V and W...  as depicted [here](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9d/88/a4/9d88a40bdcd4937365e03d9e57d6208f.jpg) so we agree on that one!Not surprised about Robin Williams, like I said when you asked, I thought it seemed like a year or two but I supposed it could easily be more like 5, so 4 years ago is pretty much exactly in the timeframe I mentioned.I knew Aretha Franklin isn‚Äôt dead, why do you think she is?  Are you confusing her with Whitney Houston?  She died a while back (edit: Wikipedia says 2012, had to fact-check myself).Re: countries or islands, there are tons we haven‚Äôt heard of because they are not relevant to world news, I had never heard of the Azores until about 5 years ago while reading a travelogue book, that never made me think it was invented just because it never crossed my conscious awareness previously.  Look at a detailed world map, I am sure we could each list 100 islands or countries the other has never heard of.Also, JC Penny, if you had asked me the spelling before gaining me the correct one I couldn‚Äôt have said for certain despite there being one I pass on my daily commute,we just don‚Äôt pay much attention to these things (for the record, I probably would have spelt it correctly, not because I know but because I would have spelt ‚Äúpenny‚Äù the same as the coin.)

My dad had a Volvo. Reg VJB 138 Y. I don‚Äôt remember the arrow. It was never there for me. And you‚Äôre sounding like a shill. We don‚Äôt pay much attention ?  How do you know what I do and don‚Äôt pay attention to. And re the anatomy changes. Why do t you go over to retconned and see what a trained nurse has to say about them. The kidneys are too high up in our body. And no I‚Äôm not confusing Whitney houston for Aretha Franklin. Sorry pal your playing the same tune I‚Äôve heard a thousand times.  Are you confusing etc etc etc. You don‚Äôt pay much attention to etc etc etc.  

Say I am a shill, it is an insulting way to say we disagree.I was taking the time to actually think about and give input on what you brought up.  Seems like you want to ‚Äúprove‚Äù your theory by simply ignoring and insulting anyone who‚Äôs experience differs from yours.  Don‚Äôt know how you missed that arrow, I remember asking my mom if the Volvo was only for dads when I learned the male and female symbols and noticed it on the car.  The anatomy, I have a vague and general idea of where organs are, not enough to actually be surprised if my knowledge isn‚Äôt very accurate, I am going by memories of those ‚Äútake apart‚Äù organ models in high school.  I am not a physician or nurse so I have never studied anatomy in depth.I do know how to kidney punch someone, are they not on the back just under the bottom ribs?  That is where I know of them.  Out of curiosity what does a kidney belt look like and how is it worn?But whatever, tune out any conflicting info and brainwash yourself.

Personally, I've noticed my attention span drastically decrease when I downloaded social media onto my smartphone.  Deleted it two weeks ago and I'm still struggling with the constant need to  look at a screen every 5 minutes.  Flip phones are few and far between but they are available and I'm thinking of getting one.  Let's not forget that when kids are raised with these they are significantly under-socialized and it encourages an instant gratification mindset.  Colorado is the first one to implement a [minimum age for smartphones]( https://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/colorado-cellphone-ban-children/2017/06/19/id/796907/)

In addition to all of these great points, I would like to point out the increasing level of ‚Äútroll‚Äù like behaviors in real life interactions. Behind a keyboard, it is easy to lash out with a snarky reply, hop right into a ridiculous argument, or just flat out be mean to another human being. This is translating into real life behaviors. No longer are the days of respectful dialogues, common courtesies and basic human interactions. People have lost basic human connections and it‚Äôs showing more and more each day. Gone are the days of being respectful to your neighbors, now you are met with a fuck you attitudes. Gone are the days of striking up a casual conversation while waiting in line. Gone are the days of playing a board game with the family. The more people disconnect from each other because they are always ‚Äúconnected‚Äù the further into the abyss we go. 

 

Well at the beginning I loved it, I loved the thought of a smarter phone. Something being more useful to me. Then, I realized that everything I'm doing is being documented somehow and that this is the realization of the book 1984. Every phone has a camera. Then when Snowden shared his stories on how guys in the NSA exchange pictures taken illegally from webcams on women, wow I really understood. This is no BS. They intend to control EVERYTHING. And record every fucking fart you make.So I quit Facebook, although I have to use Google for work and such. But all through VPN, it is seriously a grim future. It makes me sad, and to some extent a bit depressed. We have allowed a few to control the many, and even though we outnumber them - they probably have a plan for a social revolution. This isn't going to end well in my opinion, sadly. Smart "tech" and AI are enslavement tools, we love the easiness of it, but we sacrifice everything else. The generations growing up now are documenting willingly each moment of their lives.

One of the main dangers of these "smart devices" is that we have become so accustomed to having them do our "thinking" and "remembering" for us that, deprived of access to their "magic" without them, we become helpless.They have changed the way with think, the way our memories work, and the way we process information. This goes beyond the individual level, affecting how society  functions as a whole - government, industry, academia, etc... all are bound up in the web.Like"magic glasses" the tech allow us to "see" and "learn" things we could never have seen before -- but at a cost: Lose the glasses, and we're rendered blind and helpless.The network of technology is extremely fragile, and vulnerable to failures that can come from multiple sources, man-made (accidental or intentional) or natural (such as a knock-out solar flare).We've painted ourselves into one hell of a corner, I think.

As someone who has avoided 'smart' technology like the plague (despite working in a highly technologically advanced industry), I'm very interested in this discussion. Since my first mobile, I've purchased inexpensive phones that can call, text and sometimes take a shitty photo but unfortunately my trusty 10 year old LG has finally died, and I'm now in a position where an entry level smartphone may be my only option. 

It can be used as a (permanent) crutch and tool of degeneracy, or it can supply the wisdom of the ages. Try to suck all the knowledge you can out of it and move on.

I think one of the biggest effects of smart phones on society is going to be manifested on the children of this first generation of smart technology. As a parent myself, I've caught myself on numerous occasions when one of my kids comes to me for something, telling my kids "Hold On a second while Daddy finishes writing this email".   I find myself getting extremely annoyed irritated vat my own kids when they "interrupt" me while I'm immersed in my phone.I've also seen this happen with my wife, and saw the absolute look of dejection on their faces.  By not giving them e are essentially inferring to them that our phones are more important to us then they are.This not only has negative effects physcologically on them, it's also driving them into the same addictive loop that we are in. If the phone is more important to Mommy and Daddy then I am, I must have one myself.By emotionally neglecting our kids, and not giving them are undivided attention, they will surely try and find that attention in other things, including drugs, alcohol, and other destructive behaviors in search of devotion.Even after I became aware of how my addiction to smart phones was negatively impacting them, I still would still catch myself ignoring them, or even worse isolating myself in a separate room, so I could use my smart phone unmolested.In order to be completely and totally present around our kids now, my wife and I purchased a landline, and now forward all incoming calls from our cell phones to the home phone, and we leave our phones in the car. Well we at least leave them in the car until the kids are asleep, at which point we usually go and get them to catch up on all the things we missed for several hours, completely ignoring each other.I believe the effects on our children are going to very detrimental in the long term.

The device is just a piece of hardware. It's the software that addicts. Take out the phone battery or break it, and you're not addicted.Many of the answers focus on games, not social media. Why?For purposes of discussion, is a laptop a smart device? What about a smart TV?Assuming a tablet definitely is a smart device.What is a good phone to get that is dumb?

I have a theory that technology was given to us by aliens in order to eventually enslave us kind of like The Matrix. The idea is to separate us from everything that we're suppose to be connected to. Nature, spirituality, each other and the cosmos. This is done with all sort of division tactics, the creation of violent religions, war, creating conflict, lying and manipulating us to believe in false concepts of love and God. Then we become so unhappy, we get addicted to all sorts of things. Technology being the easiest and safest thing, we think. It makes our lives better and more convenient. And look how easy it is to communicate with all my friends. Except it's not real communication. It's words on a screen. We need human interaction. We need be to out in nature. We need to be able to look up at the sky at night and see the incredible amount of stars in the milky way to be reminded of what we are instead of barely seeing anything because of light pollution. And through those 3 things, we will be able to connect to the spirituality of life itself. The divine spark inside of all life. It is any wonder our country has all the problems it does with drugs, suicide and anti-depressants? Our bodies are trying to tell us something. This isn't the way humans are suppose to live. Our natural reward systems have been hijacked and rewired.This all started with the Neolithic Revolution. 7 (I think?) different spots all around the world over the course of thousands of years, all moved from hunter/gatherers to agricultural societies, independent of one another and then spread all over the globe. These groups say they got this knowledge and technology from beings from the sky, usually referred to as dragons. A model for this can even be seen in the story of Adam and Eve in the Bible. Adam and Eve get kicked out of the Garden of Eden (nature) and cursed to work the ground while Eve is told to be subservient to Adam which creates the patriarchy. That was the first step to separate us from nature and put us at odds with it, not caring if we destroy it. This also took us from abundance thinking being hunter/gatherers where everything was out in nature, you just had to go get it and you only take what you need since there was always more. To famine thinking with agriculture because you only had so many animals and crops each harvest. That induces a sort of paranoia and guardianship over what is yours because you need it to survive. In nature, everything belongs to everyone and there will always be more somewhere. This shift in thinking and lifestyle lead us all onto the path to where we are now. When farming is how you depend on your survival, you're going to try and create things that make that survival more likely and make it easier. There was no need for new technology in hunter/gatherers aside from, you could argue, weapons to hunt with and to possibly fight off another tribe but they got along just fine with what they had and there was no major competition to drive more creation of technology.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic\_Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution)>Despite the significant technological advance, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects, mostly diseases and warfare.  >  >The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increment in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth. Average height went down from 5'10" (178 cm) for men and 5'6" (168 cm) for women to 5'5" (165 cm) and 5'1" (155 cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.  >  >The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making. Jared Diamond (in The World Until Yesterday) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently. The result is that a population can increase more rapidly. Diamond points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged inequality between the sexes.So with agriculture, you bring about the need for large scale governments, leaders, social elites, slaves. The people now fight over resources, especially because of population increases. With those increases, comes the need for more control. Today, there's only a handful of companies who control the vast majority of our food that comes from agriculture. Looking at this Wikipedia entry, you can see the various problems and devastating effects that large scale agriculture is having on our planet. It's helping drive climate change and climate change will undoubtedly cause famines due to droughts and other extreme weather patterns around the world. There's no way this will be sustainable unless some sort of major shift happens in at least the way we get our energy.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental\_impact\_of\_agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_agriculture)>The **environmental impact of agriculture** is the effect that different farming practices have on the ecosystems around them, and how those effects can be traced back to those practices. The environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world. Ultimately, the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers. The connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect, as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature.  >  >There are two types of indicators of environmental impact: "means-based", which is based on the farmer's production methods, and "effect-based", which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment. An example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater, that is effected by the amount of nitrogen applied to the soil. An indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based. The means-based evaluation looks at farmers' practices of agriculture, and the effect-based evaluation considers the actual effects of the agricultural system. For example, means-based analysis might look at pesticides and fertilization methods that farmers are using, and effect-based analysis would consider how much CO2 is being emitted or what the Nitrogen content of the soil is.  >  >The environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil, to water, the air, animal and soil variety, people, plants, and the food itself. Some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are climate change, deforestation, genetic engineering, irrigation problems, pollutants, soil degradation, and waste.Interesting to think that this one shift in our way of living has lead us down a very specific road and the knowledge from which this shift is accredited to, has basically the same story across the world, that it's from other worldly beings. Only through this shift has the control and enslavement of the entire human race been possible. The driving need to constantly improve technology, dig up oil, deforest the planet, emit greenhouse gases, use up a large portion of our water supply, etc

Part of the [plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waZJzLgHGVU&t=110s)Here's an email from a leading expert in EMF's and the smart grid:The roll out  of 5G wireless service is 'a massive health experiment,' public health  expert warns as cell companies install 800,000 towers across the US    The latest generation of wireless service - 5G - is being rolled out across select cities in the US  Networks will transmit data 100 times faster using shorter radiation waves  The new network will require 800,000 new 'small cell' towers  Some research has suggested that cell phone radiation may be carcinogenic  The new millimeter waves used in 5G have hardly been studied and introducing them constitutes an 'experiment,' warns a public health professor  Natalie Rahhal, Daily Mail, May 29, 2018Wireless  carriers are constructing cell towers a stronger, faster 5G network,  but some experts warn that the updated service's health effects are  unknown and potentially dangerous.Today,  there are 154,000 cell towers in the US, according to wireless  communication association, CTIA. By 2026, it estimates another 800,000  will be needed to support 5G.The network update will bring more Americans into closer proximity with milimeter waves, very short-wave radiation.Research  on cell phone radiation has yielded mixed findings, but some studies  have linked older wireless service generations to cancers of the heart  and reproductive organs, and 5G's health effects have hardly been  studied.Wireless providers have begun  installing 800,000 'small cell' towers to support the roll out of the  new 5G cellular network, but some public health experts warn they may  endanger humans.The new network is  slated to support 100 billion devices, connecting to the internet at  anywhere between 10 and 100 times the speeds that information travels  through the 4G network.In order to  facilitate these speeds, the new network communicates through millimeter  waves (MMWs) rather than microwaves, as previous generations have.The microwave networks are nearly saturated, hence the switch to the virtually untouched, lower frequency MMWs for 5G.But smaller waves cannot travel as far, or through as many types of materials.This  means that there will need to be far more individual 'small cell  towers' closer together - some have suggested they will be on every  street corner in the US.The 5G technology is too new to have been thoroughly tested and studied by many parties outside of cell service providers.According  to Dr Joel Moskowitz, a public health professor at the University of  California, Berkeley, MMWs could pose a very real danger.'The  deployment of 5G, or fifth generation cellular technology, constitutes a  massive experiment on the health of all species,' he told Daily Mail  Online.Because MMWs are weaker than  microwaves, they are predominantly absorbed by the skin, meaning their  distribution is quite focused there,'Since  skin contains capillaries and nerve endings, MMW bio-effects may be  transmitted through molecular mechanisms by the skin or through the  nervous system,' Dr Moskowitz writes on his blog.He  also told Daily Mail Online that he's concerned that '5G will use  high-band frequencies, or millimeter waves, that may affect the eyes,  the testes, the skin, the peripheral nervous system, and sweat glands.''Millimeter waves can also make some pathogens resistant to antibiotics,' he added.Dr Moskowitz is not alone in apprehensions.The  International Society of Doctors for the Environment, its subsidiaries  in 27 countries, and more than 200 doctors and scientists are all  calling for a stop to be put to the roll out of 5G, 'due to concern that  5G radio frequency radiation will have adverse health effects,' Dr  Moskowitz says.So far, their warnings have gone unheeded.Verizon  began rolling out their 5G small cell towers in 11 cities 2017, and  AT&T started installing the new generation of service in Waco and  Dallas, Texas, as well as in Atlanta, Georgia this year.[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5784487/The-roll-5G-wireless-service-massive-health-experiment-public-health-expert-warns-a.html](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5784487/The-roll-5G-wireless-service-massive-health-experiment-public-health-expert-warns-a.html)\--More information:Scientists and Doctors Demand Moratorium on 5G5G Wireless Technology: Is 5G Harmful to Our Health? 5G Wireless Technology: Millimeter Wave Health Effects5G Wireless Technology: Cutting Through the Hype5G Wireless Technology: Major newspaper editorials oppose "small cell" antenna billsCell Tower Health Effects\--Joel  M.

What do you think?

 

I dont know about you guys, but lately I've been increasingly bored by the Internet/smartphone thing, especially the relentless advertising.To paraphrase Bruce Springsteen: One billion youtube channels and nothing's on.

I can very honestly say that I have to actively and consciously make an effort not to constantly look at my phone. I used to read ebooks on it but now make a point of getting physical books so I have less excuses to look at it.Phones are energy vampires and that energy is attention. 

I've said it before and I'll continue to: Memes are fucking stupid. The best and smartest memes are far-side cartoons. Everything of value takes more time, words, and thought than a meme can provide.

I just wanted to chime in here and say we don‚Äôt need to obsess ourselves with scripture and other fanciful apocalyptic ‚Äú Mark of the beast‚Äú shit. It‚Äôs already here. There‚Äôs no such thing as lining people up like cattle and shooting microchips in to their skin. That would cost way too much friction amongst the human masses so the next best step would be probably a smart phone. Not to mention the biggest kicker is that YOU pay for it.

 

change your phone's color mode to black & white / greyscale. Less dopamine hits from the pretty colors of apps and notifications  

In my own limited experience: Wi-Fi in very close proximity is very disruptive to cognitive functions. I did an unvoluntary test with a 1 watt wireless antenna once, to connect to another router in the house. The antenna was about 1 m from my desk and I was exposed to the wifi waves for a couple of hours a day. After a while I couldn't concentrate or even think straight. The most obvious symptoms were brain fog, headaches, dizzyness and sleepiness. There also appeared a high pitch ringing in my ears.Needless to say that I turn off Wi-Fi always on the router and phone and only use cable to connect them and recommend everyone to do the same.

Literally destroying social society at the very least.  I am pretty bad with the constant messing with/checking/looking and all that comes with it.  Every pause in conversation every awkward moment I see myself doing it.  I catch myself and put it back and do it again less than 5 minutes later.  So many triggers cause me to do it.I am conscious of it and actively trying to do something about it.  I am 35 and for a big part of my life this wasn't a thing, neither was social media.  I am very aware of all the problem.  I am very aware of technology as a whole and what it is doing to society, and I STILL do it.I cant imagine what its like for 20 somethings.  They dont know life without it.  They most likely will not be convinced there is a problem.  Even worse we got babies with tablets in front of their faces hypnotized by the digital wonder.  Dopamine  addicts being produced all over.  How do they even stand a chance?Its bad.  I dont know what can be done.

Good to see a good contributor have the winning vote. I have heaps to say, I'll wait for the trolls to assemble. 

[Tech Leaders Dismayed by Weaponization of Social Media; IEEE Spectrum; Nov 2017](https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/telecom/internet/tech-leaders-dismayed-by-weaponization-of-social-media)  TL/DR: what's dismaying these goons is Pepe and "Russian" hackers.

An interesting Tedx talk about this subject. A lot of what he talked about has been coming true in the last couple of years.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MpOBhHtDVlkI agree that this new technology is a powerful tool. One we need to respect and learn how to use it all in a proper balance.

I think Google (Halliburton/lockheed Martin) MIC killed Steve Jobs bc he was against a back door....

Sure smartphones are addictive, but is this really a conspiracy? Sex is addictive too. Is that a conspiracy? Its not the phone that is addictive per se, but the simulated social interaction and validation that is provided through it. Companies just manipulate and serve the inherent desires that already exist in humans. Not much of a conspiracy. Just serving the desires of the public and filling their cravings for validation and interaction because now the have the technology to do it. 

Technologies of the new generation help humanity, but also cause harm.

READ THIS article by Jon Rappaport. Reddit is all dif format did it change? i am kinda new so clueless but then i am that in general! thx [https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/](https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/) 

we are not going backwards to begin with, only forwards, faster and more than what we deal with now. so these people become addicted to it, so these people become dumbed down by it, incapable of saying no for some reason like sugar and bacon, so this so that... so what?   people who cant adapt will fade in history, but people who can will just come forward and take their place and flourish as always. where is the problem?

I realized I wasted my 20s online, reading bullshit. So, I've been trying to quit social media all summer. I keep deleting and re-downloading apps. I hate myself for it.I noticed I feel sort of anxious and ill when I'm within two feet of my phone. I feel better immediately after moving away from the phone.Today I went out without my smart phone. I went across town. It was fun. I felt present in a way I haven't been for years. I was THERE, in reality.

I have a flip phone.  I feel out of place during social functions.  Especially when the smart phone 'lul" takes place.  I feel like just getting up and walking out.  What the fuck is the point of spending time with people when they would rather play some lame game, read a bullshit article, or dick around on social media instead of interacting with the people they are presently with? I've never hated society more now than I ever have in my life.  It sucks.  Speaking up about it only makes me sound like a pretentious douche bag too.  

I don't believe that ban actually went into effect in CO.. that article you posted is discussing a proposed ban, and a quick search only brings up similar articles (about the proposal). Seems kind of a weird idea to me.. they're talking about fines for companies who sell phones that parents intend to give to children under 13 (wtf).. how about parents just do their damn jobs? Money would be well spent educating the public on what too much screen time does to young brains. 

I can't recommend this video enough - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc\_Jq42Og7Q&t=1049s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc_Jq42Og7Q&t=1049s) \- Jaron Lanier does an amazing job describing the differences between traditional feedback/reward loops in video games vs the straight up manipulation/behavioural modification used in social media. It really opened my eyes... 

Good on Colorado! My 6 year old nephew either wants to use my phone to play games  (I don‚Äôt have any) or play the PS4 constantly. They don‚Äôt know how to make their own fun. All they know is screen time= fun. I blame their schools for giving the kids iPads while in kindergarten. Why the fuck does a kid need an iPad in kindergarten?

>The more people disconnect from each other because they are always ‚Äúconnected‚Äù the further into the abyss we go.Very well said and so true. As someone who enjoys simple connections with complete strangers on the streets with a quick; Good morning, or genuinely compliment a total stranger for no reason, it deeply saddens me to see humanity disconnecting with one another. If everyone in the world would make it a point to genuinely compliment 2 strangers every day, we could change the world.

Radiofrequency biologically induces social isolation.

I find those things are still possible but I also note that youth are not only taught to separate sex from gender but sexual attraction from romantic attraction. Yes sex does not always involve romance but this type of education just leads to less love in the world.

Glad to know I'm not the only one noticing this change. I have noticed the number of really good students getting smaller and smaller every semester to the point that I'm lucky if the top 1 or 2 students in a class of ~40 are at least pretty good. Five to six years ago, I could always rely on the top 4-8 students being excellent. The average student is now riding the line between passing and failing all the time if graded on an honest scale. Most instructors/professors end up just lowering their standards to keep their grade distribution from sucking, and this just makes the problem progressively worse and worse.  I see a lot more students just completely give up and not even try to explain why. Something is wrong.  I'm not convinced it's all just gaming, although I definitely see how that is one of the negative effects. I think people have relied on this technology so much at fundamental stages in their mental development that many never learned how to think and come up with ideas for themselves. Even worse, they stopped learning information entirely since they can just look up whatever they need at any given moment. Never mind factthat your brain can work more efficiently when the information it needs is already firmly rooted in memory. People are starving and destroying the power of their unconscious mind by not feeding it enough information to process and organize and discover connections. This is the foundation of common sense. Fewer and fewer people have the common sense to use technology constructively because they don't even know where to begin reading up on anything outside of their limited scope of stunted understanding, nor would they even want to try if they could. Their attention span for critical thinking is approaching zero. Social media, gaming, sports, entertainment, and news are always at your fingertips. Why actually think about anything? They just look up a YouTube video later explaining how to answer the homework questions. They might retain only 10% of the needed skills the next day. If they can't find an online tutorial, they don't know how to read their textbooks so they just skip it.  

 

I have genuine conflicts with my device. First, I'll say that I would be so terribly ignorant without the years of gleaned information through the portal of a smartphone. Before I even hit online, a read stories and imagined in awe what it would be like to 'surf the net'. I found myself looking for breaking science, choosing Microbes as the overall favorite, following the catalog of the soil food web pioneered by Elaine Ingham.I found use with the built in blogging tool on MySpace, a feature brandished along the top right of your profile. It was here I began writing..well, these sort of news articles. I mocked the formats and prose I was used to reading, but pulled a bunch of content together that interrelated.I took a sniff at Facebook, maybe 2010 I guess - and hated it. It seemed like that platform was trying to minimize the input parameters of what I'm trying to say. Doesn't matter what,  by then I was used to some elbow room, as Twitter failed the smell test with 140 characters. I mean, I'm running full speed on blogs by now, and platforms like Twitter and Facebook we're cramping my style.But, of course I had a Facebook account and some of my friends had crossed over, so I ghost-friended them and stuck ardently to MS. Then MS bugged out, and I'm woke enough to draw parallels with 9/11, stinks to hell.Where do I go? You got it, FB for 3 or 4  years, bitching about it to high heaven at least once a week, fuming at the limitations, the 30 day soft-ban, and in the end, straight up manipulation of my friends news feeds by not showing any posts from me. That made me rage.Now, FB is US military, it's messenger app listens, and still the only way for me to contact some of my favorite friends is through FB.Meanwhile, I study science and academic papers, sourced discoveries and the like, and think of ways to work them into my [novel WIP](https://www.patreon.com/RogueSolid) all the while learning. I say this, because I wish more people were inclined to read a little bit about some stuff and get something for it. If I could tell your students the power of utilizing the power of information at your fingertips...Maybe I'm just a geek or eccentric, but I am beginning a project that I'm calling my 'thesis', which is Restoration of a Derelict Property Through Microbial Arrest. It's a self-appointed achievement that capstones my eight years of self-study. The internet is so valuable as a mobile tool, it's unfathomable to limit it.The flip side is health. My life is in an upheaval, and right now I only have the phone. It's hard enough to keep a full charge on it, much less the laptop I charge up once a week.Constant use. And I mean constant. I am also a guitarist and singer, and I'm always looking up new songs - when I'm not watching Rick and Morty to death.But my left hand can't hold cell phone anymore. It hurts, pretty bad. I know why, yet I can't stop. I'm addicted to my handset, and it's killing me for it.Edit: I've strived to bridge the gap to interest higher learning. Maybe instuct your class to read this [blog](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/call-arms-redefining-germ-warfare-21st-century-greg-brunty?articleId=6050019697728958464#comments-6050019697728958464&trk=prof-post) and pick it apart for homework?

Holy shit that's depressing.

this was a fabulously written report. do you teach in an asian country, by chance?

I think there's a connection between the metals they're spraying on us, and being magnetized to our phones. The advent of the smart grid has made receivers out of many tech products, and human bodies. 

>  But if i had a kid, i would NEVER let them have one. agree absolutely.  though i feel a bit like one of my great, great grandparents in the '20's saying, "I'd NEVER let one of MY kids have their own car."

It's a very complicated problem to solve. The whole economy more and more relies on the Internet. The Internet is here to stay. So are the devices that enable convenient services 24/7. Can we blame a gaming company for finding tricks to have you play more often their games ? Their business model translates to : you play more = we make more money. Can we blame social media, or any website for implementing tricks for the same reason ? Probably not.I think the answer comes from regulations, education, and self-control/discipline. Regulations from authorities, such as ban smartphones in public schools for anyone below the age of 15. If we can successfully ban smoking and drugs at school for most, we surely can ban smartphones. That may take another 15 years before these guys wake up though. Education by authorities, parents at home, teachers. Teach kids how to use their smartphones the right way, parents who limit their use at home. Have authorities educate parents on the potential dangers of smartphones for the kids. IDK how effective that would be. It's still a step forward.Self control. If I couldn't apply any self control, I would be spending my whole day playing movies on the TV, playing video games, eating chips and drinking cola. I would also drink alcohol and experiment new drugs all the time. I did all this (except for the drugs) for some time in the past, not very long, and I stopped with enough self control, and self discipline. It's also self discipline that allows me to fast for a month each year, cook at home with fresh ingredients VS buy pre-made meals at the supermarket or eat a big mac. IDK if self discipline/self control are things that can be taught. Something to look into maybe.Sadly, given the addiction power of the smartphones, and its widespread, i'm afraid they are going to do lots of damage on people before anything is done.I know of parents who sit their (not even 1 yo) child in front of the TV at night, or hand over a smartphone to look at, while they are busy doing something else. They may not be aware of the damage, however, they have the same Internet that I have, so they have no excuse not to know.

Whenever I see kids or adults hooked on these types of addiction based grinding games which hardly requires any skill, memory or learning, I'm often reminded of that Star Trek TNG episode "The Game". Don't say you weren't warned!

Well said on all your points.  I don't see it ending well either.  It indeed causes sadness and, for me, fear and intense concern for our not-so-distant future. 

No one will think if they can help it. 

That's kind of just how techonlogy works though. The industrial revolution was amazing for the world and we built our lives around it. If we somehow lost the ability to mass produce, we would have been SOL with how we structured society around it's benefits. Technology always has that effect. But no, networks are a lot more stable than you think. Network anlysis suggests it'd be almost imppssinle for something like the internef to realistically go down, baring nuclear fallout. 

It's unfortunately become quite difficult to avoid the smartphone. I try to use mine as a tool rather than a crutch, but still find I instinctively pull it out of my pocket to mindlessly check it more often than I'd care to admit. Even worse, many jobs require you to have a smartphone for near ubiquitous access via email. 

its not like having a smart phone is akin to shooting up heroin.  If you use your phone as a tool youll be fine.  i have a note 8, and i use it for art and communication.  i dont even have a single game installed on it and never had the temptation to download one.  i think you'll be fine too

Best advice here. 

massive props for recognizing a problem and not going into denial about it but rather make an effort to change.  Your kids have a great role model

Kudos dad!

Lol, stopped reading at 'patriarchy'. A plant based diet is far more healthier than eating meat. If we didnt learn on how to cultivate and grow crops and depended solely on hunting for food, we, along with the animals would have become extint long back.

Yeah man 5g scares me. Need to line my house with lead or some shit when that comes online. 

thanks for that

I had that realization about this time last year... and simultaneously realized that I hadn't read a proper book in several years, despite always being a bookworm when I was a kid (I was not very popular).Now it's been a year and I've consumed probably 30+ books in that time, some fiction, some non fiction and it's really changed my world.I realized that I had spent most of the previous decade in a fog, not really thinking that hard about anything. Now that I've broken it, I see it everywhere around me... especially in places like this where we are supposed to be digging for the truth, all too often we just let it get served to us... no thinking required, you just have to know the narrative.

That‚Äôs whats sad though is they‚Äôre literally killing the Internet with advertising. Ever notice how a lot of YouTube stuff you used to like doesn‚Äôt show up anymore? It‚Äôs all the stupid algorithm crap they have that buries good quality content for whatever stupid plastic entertainment they want to show you for that month.

THIS. I've struggled to be entertained by my smartphone. I go to politics reddit, sometimes a couple other reddits, but primarily this one for entertainment. Otherwise there are times when I realize there's nothing interesting to do on my phone. I could study, but I hate doing that on a small screen and I'm on my phone to relax

Lol this put a Smile on my face(if you get my reference to a 10year old meme)

>ionizing radiationThey're spraying us with non ferrous metal. Receivers.

what is the significance of seeing/not seeing it in your dreams? 

Dude theres already many signals in the air, your wifi does not make such difference, maybe if you had 50 routers.

26, people my age are right on the verge. We grew up mostly without cell phones, playing outside, interacting with eachother, but that all changed right as we were leaving high school. We've been smack in the middle of both sides of this and if a revolution ever happens, we will be the ones leading the charge.. For all the shit we get I think we'll be the ones to finally do something. 

 

The conspiracy is that this is just the beginning and were all doomed

>Reddit is all dif format did it change?It sure did.Use: old.reddit.com

I like that it's acceptable now to take a few minutes of a break from a social gathering.

People think it's pretentious - and I don't mind people having issues with being around groups of people but when someone whips out their phone and just starts typing away while I'm talking and nodding - I guess I just have to live with factthat I'm pretentious and think it's disrespectful af lol. 

I have a suggestion.  You should ‚Äúscroll‚Äù on your flip phone as if it was a touch screen. 

As much as I want to agree with you too many people think that they're the exception or just plain ignore the data to settle with a standard PSA outreach program.  These kids not only have access to them 24/7 but are encouraged to use them by schools as an education tool (in place of real conversation) and by parents as a babysitter/placating device.  Instead of it being used as a tool, it has replaced all aspects of our lives.  And now we have a swath of maladjusted, smartphone-dependent zombies walking around who can't comprehend self-sufficiency.  Imo, if something is such an objective harm to society, it should be regulated.

We could do it as a public service.

Conspiracy theorists applauding state restrictions. What the 

Yes, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. When you stop interacting, you start believing all the bad things you see and hear on social media and the news. You start thinking that people really are bad/scary/hateful because that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre fed. But when you actually **talk** to people, you realize you have more in common than you don‚Äôt. There are far more good ones than bad. That human connection is what keeps us all grounded in reality. Otherwise, as we see today, everyone becomes the enemy. It‚Äôs isolating us, whether that‚Äôs by design or just a byproduct. 

>As someone who enjoys simple connections with complete strangers on the streets with a quick; Good morning, or genuinely compliment a total stranger for no reasonYou are not alone. We need to make a social media app that would help people like you and I connect.

I enjoy those simple connections with strangers.  You made mention of genuine compliments...I feel the same ways that you do.  The rampant disconnection taking place is troubling and saddening.  I can't have one conversation with one of my very best friends now because he will absolutely be preoccupied with his smart phone, and he has a friend who really needs him now like never before.  It really hit me when I was talking about my late mother with whom I was very close; One of his responses after looking up from his phone proved that he didn't realize that I'd been talking about my mother (what was said absolutely didn't apply to my mother at all...that was the dead giveaway).  Man, it hurts when you get second billing to a smart phone, especially with an old (and supposedly close) friend.  

That‚Äôs making a whole lot of sense on both fronts. Thank you for sharing those links. 

 

Ah, so your standing in for ObviousMan. We need you over in r/Microbiology, pls.

Luckily my 'hands on' work is done with no networking allowed. I look after my admin stuff at home on a laptop. I may have to look into getting the old landline hooked up again.

It is true. Also, despite serious health risks, lead paint was eliminated in 90's. I think it's because they know it blocks emf's.

As a recovered heroin addict.. It was alot easier to put down the heroin than my Note 8 I'm typing on right now. Both are mind control tools. 

thanks for this helpful info!

Yes. We are doing our own will instead of God's. We think we each are our own God and we can do as we wish and nothing bad will happen. We think we can manipulate human genetics and create the "perfect" human, Designer babies are supposedly the future. Then we want to explore the cosmos and possibly seed other planets and create and manipulate other lifeforms. We think we're responsible enough to cause direct changes in the DNA of our race and change other planets when we can't even take care of ourselves?In my opinion, we are ALL God together, as one. I hurt you, I hurt myself. We are just pieces of the whole, experiencing other pieces of the whole but it is all just an illusion, we are the same. We are connected to each other through love and love comes from God.

>Lol, stopped reading at 'patriarchy' Uhh...>Diamond points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged inequality between the sexes. You're not very good at reading are you? Maybe you shouldn't have stopped. Hunter/gatherer societies were much more egalitarian, that's just a fact. I would have just say, get the fuck over it.>If we didnt learn on how to cultivate and grow crops and depended solely on hunting for food, we, along with the animals would have become extint long back. Uhhh....>The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increment in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth. Average height went down from 5'10" (178 cm) for men and 5'6" (168 cm) for women to 5'5" (165 cm) and 5'1" (155 cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels. 

It's online already.

I simply smoke. I'm addicted to it but also addicted to taking a quick break alone or  possibly with another smoker.

I think its disrespectful also.  I also find myself doing it!  Its messed up but somewhere along the line the priority section of the brain if that exists put text convos higher than most other things.  I have to fight the urge to respond or look at the phone, but thats only when I am conscious of the problem.  Its like, unless I really concentrate on not doing it, I am going to do it.  And I am not even a person that gets texts from people constantly like a lot of people, and the addiction is strong in me.

Do you think smartphone addiction is any different from being addicted to computers? Computers / internet offer the same thing.

Why Steve and Bill's kids dont get tech devices.  Probably no vaxx either. Smh

Weaponized ego. Division.

Makes me wonder if there will ever be a counter culture movement on a semi-massive scale, bordering on religiosity with rejection of social media, smart phones, or time-wasters

I love the quip that landlines are diminishing in an effort to reduce the number of exits from the matrix. Always good for a quick chuckle. 

Good call. I need the tape, and a way to obfuscate the microphone when not making calls. 

I love Oppo's idea of the sliding camera. Rather than putting the front camera in a notch like the iPhone X, they have both the front and back cameras hidden and they just slide up when needed.

vpn is pointless.

Lead attenuates ionizing radiation. Lead does not attenuate radiofrequency. Materials attenuating radiofrequency are in /r/electromagnetics' Shielding: RF wikis.

..does it really?! I'll lose my shit if this is true. I mean, plenty of other things have occurred that just make me lose my shit daily that im just like -__-  anymore (example; it is illegal to collect and use rainwater, therefore leading to you HAVING to not only pay for water but also consume the water that has been properly fitted with the chemicals those above us deem necessary for our regular consumption..like fluoride that calcifies our pineal gland which is crucial to our higher level of consciousness, free thought & creativity.) 

you probably have an addictive personality in general.  not saying that to downplay what you're saying at all, but I might be the exact opposite of you as far as that goes.  I don't drink or smoke anything and never had the desire to.  On that same token I can forget my phone at home or work and not notice till I'm about to go to sleep and set my alarms.  I can absolutely see how someone can have trouble with that though.  I see it everyday actually, so the risk is def out there.Also, one last thing, good on you for breaking the drug habit man.  Stay vigilant 

You are welcome.

I didnt say I dont believe, I jsut think the new 5G networks will fuck us harder than just one wifi network, especially here in europe where 10 different companies all put their own network.

Yeah I graduated 2010 like I said my age puts me in direct conflict. 26-29 ur Olds right now are struggling. It's so hard to date.. I meet a girl even 2 years younger than me and I can't get them off their phones/social media. I don't want to date a wannabe Instagram model that needs constant attention. I keep having so many failed relationships just because these young woman have a constant, incessant need for attention and to be entertained.. And I'm OK with doing nothing and just enjoying time together.. But than they get bored and want to be on their phones, running around being a hoe.. It's rough being on the precipice of this divide and very few people understand this plight. 

I was also raised in Alaska and wasn't allowed to have a cell til I was 16 and it was a flip phone. I didn't have a smart phone til I was 19 so maybe that's why saved me.

Good point! and with Wi-fi connected Smart T.V.s. I dont buy cable/direct tv because I hate advertisements and mainstream media.Sooo we have the kids using a remote control to navigate through you-tube and netflix.It's a double edged sword. 

Steve and Bill were smart enough to make billions, and lived in the epicenter of the very industry they helped create. Bill Gates spends billions of dollars on global vaccinations efforts. 

That book was written before smart phones were invented. Truth is they have been deliberately dumbing us down for 100 years now. 

The minimalists are half way there already.

I can ask some colleagues who work with younger people. Mine generally grew out of their rebellious phase for the most part.

Lions mane [https://blog.kettleandfire.com/lions-mane-mushroom/](https://blog.kettleandfire.com/lions-mane-mushroom/) supports healthy brain function. Magnesium (topically) vit D, supplement. Don't eat the meat, drink the water, or do anything they endorse. Shunglite/orgonite and other EMF negation elements are available. Opt out of smart meters. 

how about no.

I might just go price DSL with landline now thanks for the idea.

I'm not sure how to handle the microphone, that seems quite difficult. The most secure phone I've found so far is [this one](https://www.silentcircle.com/buy-blackphone2/). Though I'd like to share an anecdote: a friend of my brother was minister of justice and his phone was something my brother had never seen before. It also had a dongle that encrypted everything. So the governments of out world protect themselves but would like to keep us out of that loop.

how so?

Right.

I'm from Alaska.. Everyone I know turned to heroin addicts over night.. I was the only one who actually started down that path from a car crash that destroyed my back and was actually prescribed these pills. I truly believe HAARP is screwing with peoples brain waves.. Everyone I know who stayed back home after hs turned to an addict. I was finally able to break the curse when I moved to AZ.. There is a power plant outside my front door now.. I feel it's energy constantly and haven't slept right in months. I finally cut out the bs and sugar and tons of meat from my diet and started eating healthy and taking care of my body and I feel better than I ever have in my adult life.. But I swear I'm constantly being attacked by different pitches of ringing in my head and it's not just tinnitus. 

Look on my profile under posts. 

I've tried ecigs that are like cigs ehookahs and expensive vapes. I dislike vaping a great deal. The only time I've liked it was when vaping CBD and I have had many disposable vapes for herb and wax for bud or a mix of bud or dabs and CBD dabs. With any type of substance I prefer to just smoke it. Even with dabs I found myself just putting the wax in $1 foil pipes and firing it constantly. I prefer smoking plant material in cig or rolled form. I just can't do the vapes. I have an herb vape that didn't arrive in time for my trip to Denver so I'll probably just sell it. Many folks have recommended juul but it seems like there's more nicotine in them and I already smoke a ton. I can see myself juuling and smoking and upping my intake. Back when I smoked a lot of pot I mixed tobacco in and was smoking more than I am now.

Fuck Juul never ever buy that shit product

yeah because bill is a eugenicist 

My point is, they disallowed their children from using technology.

Hell yes, I take Lions mane- that stuff is the bomb. I do eat meat though (all pasture raised)- I tend to follow the principles of the Weston Price diet. 

*It's ok for us to do it but you're just not responsible enough yet.*

Internet security is an illusion.

 

Eh yeah I feel you. I definitely felt the same about vaping. I do smoke way less now (measured by 1 Juul pod=~1 pack). If you ever decide to try down the road of quitting but can't quite yet, it's a viable option.

What is it like to vape CBD?

Didnt they have a patent for some kind of screen hypnotic technology?

bingo. 

Privacy for me, but not for thee

So if VPNs don't work why are so many companies still using them to access their internal networks from remote locations successfully? edit: you did'nt say why they dont work, so please give a direct reason they won't work in the situation I described

Obviously not. Nvm, thought you were trying to help. I'll do it later. 

Calming but it takes many hits by itself. Good for offsetting too much THC when mixed though.

yeah i think so .. something about how they can use it to manipulate the nervous system

r/technology

This is what's up now. If you research 5g, it's sinister af. Check it out in my comment.

thank you for the link. Haven't been to that sub yet

 

And spreading the word.

The solution that I've found is based on decentralization.  We need to break the monopoly of force nation states wield.  I hear all the time on this sub and others that corporations and money are the root of evil.  Well, I disagree with this statement.  Evil corporations are nothing without a state power structure propping them up.  Left to their own devices, most of these parasitical companies that exploit people and countries for profit would crumble to the ground if funds dried up.  That's impossible if our tax dollars continue to fund them.  If we really want to change the world for the better, we first have to break the monopoly of government, and stop funding our own demise and enslavement.Blockchain technology could be our saving grace in this new world.  It provides a base for immutable transactions and documentation.  Some of the things it can provide is documentation of property ownership, monetary transactions, vital records, and voting tallies.  Blockchain technology has the ability to make government centralized authority and record keeping obsolete.  In addition, it removes power from the banking system.If we really want a more peaceful and just world, I think we need to start finding alternatives and working together, independently.  Ignore the current system and start building your own.  We have the technology, now we just need the numbers.Using force to make people do things is not a solution.  Making people comply to your demands will only lead to resentment and conflict.  People should be free to make their own decisions and self-organize. People have the right to live their own lives.  One of the main problems that we have in this world is that other people believe they have the right to tell others what to do.You really want to change the world?  Stop trying to control people, and mind your own damn business.  Be the change you wish to see in the world, and live by the Non-aggression Principle. 

Step 1. Abolish the Federal ReserveStep 2. Create a bank democratically controlled by the people. Print a new fiat currency backed by gold and our natural resources.Step 3. Create a new court system to prosecute those who created the financial and environmental disasters of the last 100 years.Step 4. Use the wealth gained to create sustainable surpluses of food, housing, and energy. Methods such as vertical farming combined with solar and geothermal are realistic. Scarcity is a myth.Thats my 4 step plan. I hope you enjoyed it. For some more solutions, [Paul Stamets - 6 ways mushrooms can save the world](https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_stamets_on_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_world) is a must watch. Stamets is a real life hero. This quote by him is highly relevant‚ÄúWe are now fully engaged in the sixth Major Extinction (‚Äú6 X‚Äù) on planet Earth. Our biosphere is quickly changing, eroding the life support systems that have allowed humans to ascend. Unless we put into action policies and technologies that can cause a course correction in the very near future, species diversity will continue to plummet, with humans not only being the primary cause, but one of the victims. What can we do? Fungi, particularly mushrooms, offer some powerful, practical solutions, which can be put into practice now.‚Äù[The Corbett Report](https://www.corbettreport.com/tag/solutions/) is also a great solutions resource.

It's actually really simple: Be the change you want to see. 

We need to focus on ways of promoting empathy in children and basically breeding sociopathy out of our species. When it comes down to it, the root of all our worst problems is factthat sociopaths have an advantage in getting to positions of power and a greater desire for power. If we can somehow screen for it or eradicate it then everything would become so much easier to solve. Or bypass it somehow, by building a society in which decency honesty and kindness are prized above all else-fuck knows how to achieve that though!

The solution to poverty is simple.  End all foreign aid.  Failing financial systems, failing governments, overpopulation, etc are all problems that will correct for themselves if given the chance.  Foreign aid is not humanitarian, it is just couched in these terms to continue the vast profits and global influence so called charitable organisations make.They destabilize local farming and manufacturing.  No one can compete with free.  They then use this destabilization to lower the cost of future investment, taking over entire economies after destroying them.It sounds harsh, but these problems will solve themselves faster without intervention.

This is slightly off the original topic but upon pondering the question I thought of Parenting. If you have a child or have nieces, nephews, neighbors, etc, they need you in their life. They need trustworthy mentors in order to be emotionally stable, self-actualize and find meaning in the world. Having a positive impact in a kids life and really showing them how to have confidence, seek knowledge, respect the earth (im a farmer), think for themselves but also respect traditions and their elders are some of the most important things you can do with the breath in your lungs. I have friends with 3 or 4 kids that are well behaved and friendly and I just think how nice it is and how important it is for the future for people to take that responsibility seriously.

If humanity is going to survive and thrive on this planet, were going to have to learn to govern ourselves better and work together. Right now most governments in the world are oligarchic (like the United States) or straight-up authoritarian. We need to establish a more civil society, work through our differences to solve problems and preserve our freedoms, and end rule by elites. I'm reluctant to advocate for any particular group, so here's a page with lots of groups working on these types of issues. Some are nonpartisan, others progressive or conservative. Lots of important work happening. Throw them some support if you can. https://www.bridgealliance.us/ourmembers

to whomever it may concern, know this: the general public is intentionally being eased into a distrustful and a conspiratorial worldview. Questionable events are deliberately staged and made to appear suspicious, for the purpose that people will investigate, following bread crumb trails laid out in psyops on the internet and organizing around them. Those who follow the trails will eventually discover the occult, working together to illuminate themselves into higher spiritual consciousness, and overthrow the present system, replacing it with a new and spiritually enlightened world order. This is the true agenda of the demonic forces who pull the strings in the world, and it is an irreversible trap for every single person who is on board.

Cheers everybody.

The world has major economic woes. People struggle to get enough food, clean water, basic sanitation and medicine.To remedy this, we need to start by developing a space economy. u/FreedomIntensifies made an incredible comment about building a large satellite to harvest solar power that deserves to be read in its entirety, but the benefits are summarized as:> can be completed within 2-3 years (less than one term in office)> costs up to $30 trillion but generates $18 trillion in revenue per year upon completion (costs are very, very conservative high end estimates as you will see later and ~$5T is more reasonable but I don‚Äôt want to oversell)>   at the end of 4 years, you have a net profit of $6T plus $18T in revenue every year thereafterWe could also build something like an [orbital ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E) and attach a space elevator to it to dramatically lower launch costs, enable power to be transmitted to the surface using a wire instead of wirelessly (more efficient), and can be used as a high speed rail system for terrestrial transport, due to the almost nonexistant wind resistance in space.In addition to generating solar power in space, we would also open up the [$100 trillion](https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/09/the-potential-100-trillion-market-for-space-mining/) market for asteroid mining. This is the type of thing that could pay off the national debt with just a few missions, and dramatically lower the cost of many goods for everyone on earth.While fusion is being developed and may become a better alternative in the future, [thorum-based fission reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium-based_nuclear_power) are another option to dramatically lower human misery. They offer the ability to produce energy at a much lower cost than any conventional form of electricity generation with very little nuclear waste. In addition, they can be used for things like nuclear desalination of water, which will help reduce the millions of annual deaths because *many of our fellow human beings can't get water that doesn't have shit in it*.Finally, put the lawyers and the bankers in camps.

copy pasta from u/Jac0b777  but is really goodit's time to focus on the solutions. We have all the power in the world to turn the game around. Let's do it. (self.conspiracy)submitted 12 hours ago * by Jac0b777The vast majority of this community (as well as many outside it) are well aware of what is going on in the world. Even if we cannot pinpoint exactly what is the root cause of what's happening or the people behind the madness, we know that things cannot go on the way they are. Even people that are not open to the idea of the world's current state being the result of a conspiracy know we cannot keep doing what we are doing, as the end result will be the endless suffering of humanity in a dystopian nightmare and a ravaged planet with a destroyed biosphere.Spreading awareness is fantastic, but as awareness is spread about the world's ills, so too fear and hopelessness is spread with it, like a shadow that never leaves it. There are endless pieces of information and leaks coming out that show insane amounts of corruption and psychopathy among the tiny minority and the majority of "order followers" that go along with it, even if deep inside their heart is telling them to stop.But within all the leaks, the theories, the issues.... we rarely find calls for solutions. We rarely see any encouragement and call for action in what YOU can do in order to make this world better and humanity freer. Because do not kid yourself, the ultimate reason humanity is in the situation it is in is the result of the choices it has made. If there is a minority that is conspiring against the majority in order to gain all the wealth and power for themselves, it is because the majority have allowed this to happen, through their own passivity, ignorance and ultimately unconsciousness.But with new choices come new results. And we desperately need new choices, so new results can flourish. Ultimately, this needs to happen on the level of the individual. The individual needs to change their life and choices and the more individuals can do this, the more the fire will spread. One person can affect many, by his thoughts, actions and example. Those he affects in turn affect others....and so the fire spreads until it engulfs as all. Those that do not wish to participate and choose to selfishly turn a blind eye on the rest, will have themselves and their descendants engulfed in the suffering as humanity and this planet crumbles. In my opinion there is a definite light at the end of the tunnel. But movement towards it has to accelerate now, in no past or future is this possible.So what can we do on the level of the individual? Here are some of my ideas on the subject (feel free to add to this list in the comments, any more solutions would obviously be very useful):-Take care of your health. The only way you can make a change is if you take care of the body you are in. My suggestions on this: Exercise, eat healthy food, engage in breathing exercises (I heavily recommend breathing through your nose at all times, yes even during exercise - I recommend the book 'The Oxygen Advantage' by Patrick Mckeown for further details). What should you eat? Whatever your body truly wants. I will not recommend diets to you, only awareness. If you are aware when you eat, during, after and before eating, of your body and mind, you will notice what food makes you feel better, stronger, happier (yes food affects mood), makes your mind clearer.... Connect to your body, listen to it and you will know what to eat. This is how I cured my massive gastrointestinal issues. I could recommend my diet to you, but I won't, instead I'm recommending awareness, which will give you the optimal personalized diet for your body.-Take care of your mind and embrace what is beyond your thoughts. You may not agree and you do not have to, but in my experience, the root state of all being (beyond all the pain, the fog of suffering) is one of peace. I encourage you to engage in meditative and introspective practice and find this out for yourself. Meditate, write your thoughts down on a paper and destroy it, introspect, look within embrace your pain and let it go (maybe this practice can be of help ‚Äì Embracing & Dissolving Inner Suffering, it is something I wrote a while back)‚Ä¶the more of the inner fog you let go of and the more you focus on the present moment, as well as the inherent peace, freedom, love and gratitude that are present in it and root you inside it, the more you will become a beacon of light in this world that so desperately needs it. -Be aware of how you spend your money. Your money is your energy. By spending it you are supporting and giving energy to whatever it is that you are spending it on. Companies that act unlawfully, that are destroying the planet, killing and abusing, torturing animals (including for scientific experiments), enslaving people and bringing devastation to third world countries.... should be avoided whenever possible. Yes, I understand, sometimes this is not possible (for financial or other reasons). But if you just start to take that into account more as you buy things and spend your money, you will be making a difference, even if it's a small one. This can be done with food (where you support small farmers instead of big corporations, organic food instead of GMOs, companies that care about the environment and animals more than those that don't), it can be done with software (supporting open source software like Linux instead of Windows...with countless similar examples - I have just switched to Linux and I love it), it can be done with clothing (don't buy clothes you don't need, consider buying used clothes at times, check which companies support less suffering when it comes to the horrible conditions of manual labour in the east - many times you cannot avoid this fully, but you can mitigate it),......But also, don't buy things you don't need and if you have something extra that you don't need anymore, consider giving it away (or even selling it if you need the money).-Spread awareness on the issues that matter, but always add possible solutions to the table. As I said in the beginning, spreading awareness is crucial, but doing so with an energy of hopelessness and fear is detrimental. Show the world what needs to be seen, but always add the possibility of changing the situation around, think of solutions and avenues of action that can make said situation or event better. Expose the dark, but don't dwell in it - find ways to turn into the light.-Value your community. Friends and family are precious - in any world that is truly free, the impact of those that are closest to you will be heightened. The impact of those you care about as well as those that live near you is important. Be kind and generous to them, offer a helping hand if they need your assistance and you can give it. But above all, try to accept them as they are and see beyond their faults. If anyone close to you has hurt you, forgive them. Also remember, you do not need to have people in your life 

"Alternatives to current forms of government" That, my friend, is the most overlooked topic. And you cant discuss having a new political paradigm without discussing economics. Philosophically and in practice, the government by definition controls and "regulates" a naturally anarchistic free market economy.‚ÄãRule #1 for any new future government attempting to be in the peoples best interest:NO BAILOUTS.‚ÄãThat is probably the most important thing that is underestimated when it comes to the publics long term benefit.Our constitution has a lot of salvageable concepts as well such as freedom of speech, religion, and the press at its foundation. Not to mention the 2nd and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures which has been shit on soooo hard.‚ÄãThese things need to be looked at not as laws necessarily, but as creating the best environment for human success.Sure, the creators of this nation are not perfect and neither is the Constitution; Which may seem like a bold statement to some, but it's really not. (Even though I still believe it the best document written to limit government power and maintain human rights, to date)‚ÄãGovernment and politics should be a heavily scrutinized and evolving concept as it always has been. To feel that we are at the pinnacle of human organization is folly.

Breaking Free of the Overton WindowOne of the biggest Overton Windows is showing people that the government taxing people is not necessary.  Instead of the government generating its income from its citizens/businesses, it should look elsewhere to generate that income.  Solutions for generating income include(off the top of my head):* Tariffs* Space Elevator (Use this to deploy Solar Panels to sell energy to the rest of the world, Asteroid Mining, Space Farming, Space Manufacturing, etc)* NAWAPA* Nationwide Hyperloop Network (The government could build this and take a portion of the sales to fund itself)* Replacing the Fed with (Third Bank of the United States... similar to the Bank of North Dakota)* Thorium Nuclear Reactors (Meltdown proof, would lower current energy costs by 50%, used to desalinate/distill water)* If countries want our military presence for intervention, they should cut a check to Uncle SamIm sure there's more... if  some random noob on reddit can catalogue these, what are our politicians doing?&#x200B;

[Want Solutions? - Here You Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maq1L6gUKRI)

It‚Äôs may seem small, but I think supporting local organic farms could be an important first step in a direction we should want to go in.     

Fix your diet. Exercise a little. Dump your doctor. Decentralize healthcare.

The current regime in both worlds - this sub and this political epoch - expresses its intentions by posing them as solutions. But in nearly every case the original problem is in serious contention.We were told that Islamic extremism was the problem. We were told the population growth was the problem. We were told the burning of fossil fuels was the problem. The solutions imposed: continuous war, targeted depopulation, and the seizure of the atmosphere by geotechnology.Clearly the current power structure first manufactures the problem and then implements a predetermined solution. Interestingly, the problem is never the existing power structure and their transparent bogus problem-solution strategy.In my opinion the planet is entering a new phase and nobody really knows what metamorphosis is underway. We now need to think radically askew (non-orthogonal). Problems ARE solutions. Solutions ARE problems. Time can and must advance and return in all directions. We are each an infinitely dense gravity well connected with every other. 

The solution is Paul Wellstone, JFK, JFK Jr., RFK, MLK Jr., Malcolm X, Dennis Kucinich, Cynthia McKinney, Gary Webb, Mike Connell, Danny Casolaro, Gary Caradori, Pat Tillman, Dr. David Kelly, Barry Jennings, Dr. David Graham, Seth Rich.  The country would be different if these people were allowed to live.Foreign leaders such as Gaddafi, Hussein, Allende, etc would have also been solutions instead of the downfall their societies underwent after their murders.The solution is exposing these deaths, preventing more from happening in the future, and exposing the false flag operations that have haunted our development throughout history.

I've been collecting some potential solutions here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyActivism/wiki/indexAfter thinking about this for some time, I think the most effective way we can do anything meaningful is through boycott. A complete boycott of the military industrial complex. Boycott helped to turn South Africa around and is at the forefront of Israel criticism. The elites are all about harvesting cash from us, so why wouldn't we start there?We can all easily change whom we bank with, what our 401k retirement funds are supporting, and what we buy. But will you put your money where your mouth is and accept some inconvenience in order to stop funding the war machine?Also these guys are on it and are actually making a difference, with successful legislation passed in multiple states: https://represent.us/our-policy-platform/

Does anyone know how much 3d space  as in stacked dirt shelves or stack aqua or hydroponocs it takes to feed a single person.  How big would a system need to be to feed one person?Could it fit in every single apartment? Seems like getting those automated and in every apartment would do a lot to change the world.Obviously would need to be electrically powered for grow lights but that another issue.

Whatever system we make will only be sustainable if built around compassion and consent. 

We need to eliminate and destroy weather machines. Tax the wealthy globally and appropriately. Fund private investigators to determine who holds the profits from human trafficking. Eliminate all debt in the United States by discovering where the 21 trillion went. Eliminate any trade tariffs domestically and globally. Provide universal higher education and health insurance and legalize marijuana. Eliminate all GMOs and proven dangerous pesticides.

1. Stop taking loans, and work hard to repay individual debts, abolish taxes, destroy money(render money useless)2. Everyone knows and does everything themselves by sharing knowledge(from growing food to building houses) 3. Eliminate the police and army and let people defend themselves and their property by any means necessary4. Stop sending children to school, instead parents teach their kids(stop the viscious cycle of consumerism)5. Live by simple rules( Don't hurt/kill others, don't steal other's property)6. Property defined as amount of space a family can use to feed themselves and shelter themselves7. Be kind and helpful to neighbors and develop a sense of community and empathy among people living in close proximity

become the change you want for the world. Exersice more, eat healthy, stop consuming what you dont need, be mindfull of yourself and the people around you.  Reproduce and be a good parent. Have good kids and a nice family. If you and likeminded people keep this up somewere down the road there is going to be a critical mass of good people on earth, we can start turning things around then.

We need a "soulution"Someone probably said that already. But if not, yeah, free our minds spirits and those of others.Raise the new ones better.Obstain from bullshit pop culture, be conscious of how we "vote" by spending our money.Love others, hear them out and maybe be able to get a word in edgewise.Trying to change someone's mind in an aggressive manner can do more harm at times, although it's difficult with the world burning.Lead good lives and just spread the truth.We manifest reality to an extent, so just stay positive and chamge how we react to the negative things.I think Jesus is quoted(or an apostle) something along the lines of "Be in the world; not of it"Organize people to make positive changes. Exposing the snakes is good and all until you shoot yourself in the back of the head 3 times.If we evolve past needing them they won't have power over us.Let their corruption expose itself as we do what we can.No great revolt will make a difference if we are still sick in our souls.

The only viable solutions first require the self-organization of the working class, be it around alternative political movements, alternative currencies, alternative economic institutions, alternative media, or whatever. Unless that happens, any attempt to create a new system will inevitable be violently attacked, economically strangled, and vilified in the culture, as has happened to most such attempts throughout history. Without that organization too, even if some effort to resist TPTB succeeded, it‚Äôd only result in the changing of the figure heads atop the same old system.Read Murray Bookchin.

I am glad this went through, and I'd like to thank those that made it happen, and those that take an interest, because I fully believe we can make a difference.  I will be adding my 2 cents to the other comments shortly here, but for now I'd like to talk about exposure.  For those that haven't had a chance, I'd like you to read a couple posts, and for a short disclaimer, my short descriptions do these posts no justice, I believe these posts can save the world.:  **This post talks about our place in the world.**Community Service - In between the dust and the dust:  https://reddit.app.link/750gDNGmGP  **This post has a brilliant 30 day plan for ending poverty, and ultimately the entire plauge that we as humanity face.**  Let's Talk About Food:  https://reddit.app.link/ChdDwRQqGP  **This post talks about where we are at right now in humanity**You've changed humanity, and not for the better:  https://reddit.app.link/2Y8z7GSqGP  u/PieceOfChance I would like to hear your thoughts on this solutions round table.  Back to exposure, that is a problem we face, the "conspiracy theorist" lable is killing us, even though those that believe in the propoganda we are fed, are literal conspiracy theorists, example is russian collusion.  There is a grand conspiracy that is the reason for where this world is right now and in the past.  Just about everybody in the world, see's something they don't like, but they don't attribute these things to their main cause.  Divided we fall right? We need proper exposure, and for that we need to unite under all the problems.  Exposure, I'd like to see posts like the ones I've shared above, printed in mass, and littered throughout the cancer that is cities for all to see.  Internet trends....  Saddens me to fucking say this, but we need a fucking pound sign, or rather an octothorpe, I mean a hashed tag. A group name....  Ask yourself now, "what am I?"  Me personally, I am a human, born into this world with you and our problems. I think life has to be some sort of fucking game, this world is so fucked, what if you, I or we fuckin fixed it?  In our entire recorded.... Think about that, entire recorded history.... Humanity has been losing,  orwell explained it perfectly:  >Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.  The internet.... We can reach the entire world in seconds, let's trend.... We are the hashtag SomethingIsFuckingWrong party?   We need the technology that we have already, we need food(If you havn't read the let's talk about food post above, do it now), we need shelter, we need a means of exchange, world wide...  Things can be done differently though, a rich life could be gaurenteed for all of humanity.  Bickering will never work, fuck... I want to limit our speech... Something is fucking wrong with the entire world, that is our problem. We need to stress as our main cause, that something is wong, and we can rid life of these parasites in control.We are the only species on earth that can actually change it... Let's fucking do it.  Peace and love to you all.

I was asked to copy and paste this comment I made in a thread from r/C_S_T.I believe a basic universal income needs to be discussed and considered more. There are too many people that are struggling to survive, when the country has all the means to help. We will not be changing anything else about our economy, leaving the free market and workplace in place. Not much will change regarding these things. People tend to want more than food, shelter, and healthcare, so most will still work jobs and continue to start and continue careers. The argument that the people receiving this will not get jobs and will become miserable is simply ridiculous. People are living off of welfare as it is, these people will continue that whether it is implemented or not. The people who want more, will still get jobs, and still work to provide a better life for themselves and their families. This so why we need to keep the free market and capitalistic ideals we currently have. A universal income will allow peak innovation. More people who have ideas for products, businesses, and anything else that requires some risk and some money to attempt will do so, because they no longer need to worry about feeding, housing, and caring for themselves and their family. factof the matter is, most people will not take these risks, because it puts them in a place that can possibly endanger them and their family‚Äôs lively hoods. Implementing a basic universal income will allow them to take these risks while still knowing they will be okay if it doesn‚Äôt work out. There are many problems that come with it, as with ANY economical idea, and it is by no means a perfect system. Simply implementing it as is would be disastrous. That being said, there needs to be deeper discussion on it, and will need some manipulating and change for the idea to be a better fit for current society. 

How bout a pay system based on Energy level & Skilled Output, and not just the 'pay by the hour' half-measure? Money needs to be the motivation again, not just a single place where we spend all of our time. The current system in place works when everybody uses it correctly, but in the world of low profile pyramid schemes, obscure monopolies, and minimum wage normalities, your efforts are largly outstepped by just doing things 'not to get fired from here.' Profit and Potential is quelled by the black hole of the timeclock.

We need social media 2.0 like collaborative web2.0 where digital cooperative groups collaborate in their R&D efforts to make projects that help people. Physical Co-Ops could utilize the R&D, operating as a mentorship program to uplift participants. Could use proof of value cryptocurrency to incentivise participation, and then currency would only be made when members collaborate on a socially uplifting project together. This is the TLDR version of what I fucks with

Lots of people here are striking out at the bigger picture solutions and that's fucking awesome. Rather than go on and try to retread ground about Anarchism, decentralization, etc; I will go for some lower hanging fruit.Within the political system of the American Republic are two main Parties- currently inhabiting the 5th Party System. Through these two Parties virtually *all* US politicians and political ideas arise. Therefore, before we can change fundamentals about the Nation State or International relations, we must first gain control of our own system. Before we can reform voting and allow for even more Parties to be created, we first have to storm the existing ones.Taking a Party is far easier than many believe- and the knowledge of how to do so is kept intentionally obscure and irrelevant to most people. But the answers are there- publicly available.For an example, I will use the Democratic Party. The smallest organizational of the Dem Party is the Precinct. This is the smalles organizational structure of the entire US voting system- you vote by your precinct, which is determined when you register to vote. Any registered Democratic Party member can attend their Precinct meetings. Now the times and locations of these events are usually public information- until activists begin attending. Then, often, that information suddenly becomes harder to find- but not impossible. In fact, it's not legally possible at all to completely hide this information.At Precinct meetings, Precinct Chairs are chosen. This is an individual who is voted, by majority of those in attendance, to become the Precinct Chair for ~1 year. The Party organization scales upwards from here, reflecting the American electoral organization. There is a County Chair, and a State Chair, and a National Chair. The Precinct Chairs vote for the County Chairs, who vote for the State Chairs, who vote for the National Chairs. This is the fundamental bureaucratic structure of *both* Parties. All that is required is registered membership in that Party- a shitty thing to many here, I know- but a necessary evil if we want to begin the path to change. All that is required to take the Precinct Chairs is organization- Finding the meeting time/location, then getting enough registered members there and in agreement on who to vote for. Many of those running these Precinct meetings are aging local Party elders who are absolutely not expecting a surge or a fight for Precinct Chair.This is how we storm the Parties. This is how we force change *up*, from the grassroots. We can not put our faith in Presidents or Congressmen, when they are controlled and selected by a corrupt Party in the first place. We must *storm* the Parties first and foremost, and force them to bow to the Will of the People. 

it was said that we create peace through war...   we can just have one final world war and the winner, becomes the leader of the unified earth as one nation - not united nations, but like the US and all the others are just states. then we will have peace, many will die in this generation but how many generations to come will be free from war. 

Let‚Äôs do a first small step that‚Äôs achievable. Let‚Äôs remove money from the electoral process. Let‚Äôs set aside a small amount and once you can gather enough signatures you get your share of it. That‚Äôs the only amount that you‚Äôre allowed to spend. That‚Äôs it.Our politicians spend their days begging for money from the first day they enter office. Therefore they only represent the money. Once we have politicians that truly represent the people. Maybe then we will stand a chance. I don‚Äôt care if it takes a constitutional conference in all 50 states. This is the only path forwards that I see.

Money:Society::Blood:BodyBlood is no good if it isn't circulating. People hoarding dollars is no good, like an aneurysm waiting to burst. We won't progress, so long as accumulation of money is the driving goal.You could run the world off of a single dollar, if it circulated fast enough. I thought Bitcoin would usher in the age of plenty, but then you got all those investors trying to hoard wealth, and it all goes back down the shitter.

Rojava's system of Democratic Confederalism (based on the philosophies of Murray Bookchin) is as good of a solution as anything I've seen to the question 'So, what's next?'&#x200B;r/rojava 

Honestly, the best and most efficient government any kind of culture can have is Socialism. Hypothetically, in socialism the government completely dishes out it's resources and efforts back onto the people. If that socialistic government was GOOD, and actually FOR THE PEOPLE, no other system can even compete with Socialism. Unfortunately, in our world, the government will never be for the people, so socialism is actually bad.  Then you got Democracy, complete shit, and even Aristotle pointed this out over 2,000 years ago. The Democracy of people fighting over what they want, opinions are like assholes. The real solution to Democracy with more Democracy is to gather at the local level and establish community-based systems of trade, culture, etc. This will eventually effect the large scale to follow suit.

"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.‚Äô The second is this: ‚ÄòLove your neighbor as yourself.‚Äô There is no commandment greater than these.‚Äùr/Christianityhttps://voat.co/v/conspiracyr/Anarcho_Capitalismr/Libertarianr/btc

If you consider solutions to our ills, keep in mind the diverse nature of opinion on what a "better system" looks like. If you go to an AnCap, Revolutionary, or Libertarian board, you will hear the same disagreements over and over, and very little in the way of solutions.  At the end of the day, if 100 AnCaps cannot agree on whether abortion should be allowed in their society, there is NO HOPE for 30% liberals, 30% conservatives, and 40% moderates to come to an agreement on how we should change.  You can "fight the system" all day long, but if you do not have something better to replace it with, you're just wasting your energy. Voluntarism is a principle, it is not a prescription for a working system. If 20% of the population wants something close to Anarcho-Capitalism or Minarchism, and the other 80% do not agree, it is difficult to proceed. Also, you cannot get agreement even in that 20%, so what now?  Insanity  To try the same thing over and over, expecting different results... is madness. It is futile windbaggery that frustrates and divides. Neophytes with no conception of advanced game theory put forward "solutions" to our ills that almost always revolve around a "one size fits all" model of government.Anyone with any experience in social systems knows that socio-economic systems cannot be accurately modeled with any predictive power. Almost no natural or complex system can be modeled and predicted, period. It doesn't work for monetary theory, political theory, social choice theory or anything complex, whatsoever. The \[geek talk\] exponential complexity of the interactions make predictions almost useless.All you can do is to "test and check". The most advanced neural networks in the world use a repetitive guess and check algorithm that simply keeps guesses that come closer to the goal while throwing away guesses that do not converge on the solution. The is the SMARTEST POSSIBLE WAY to go about designing a complex system.&#x200B;SO...  We need a social model that embraces and perfects the guess and check paradigm, and no current solutions adequately take this into consideration. All due respect to Stephan Molyneux, but "practical anarchy" is prescriptive, and if any flaws exist in his complex system will doom it to failure.&#x200B;You could say, "Freedom" is the answer, and to some extent you are right. We need the freedom to try many different things, and the "market of ideas" will weed out the bad ideas and select the good ones. The best possible system to embrace is a system that allows this to occur, and to the layman just entering this intellectual space, and the intransigent veteran, that seems like Libertarianism, until you join a group of libertarians and listen to them battle about the inane. Then it seems like Anarcho-capitalism provides the necessary freedom and structure, and then you get into a group of AnCaps, and the same thing occurs. Finally, you embrace Anarchy and the non-aggression principle in its purest form, and your system gets distilled down to a single principle, with no supporting framework.&#x200B;I don't want to denigrate these systems, because they embrace a valid, natural set of principles, and I will concede that Anarchy might work if everyone embraced the spirit of it, and were willing to give it a try.  However, this is not the case. You can blame indoctrination. You can blame the diversity of culture or something bizarre, but it is simply not the case that the 300+ million people around you will embrace the "do it yourself" "radical self reliance" that anarchy requires.&#x200B;Also, anarchy is unorganized by its very nature. If you have two towns, and one is ruled by anarchy and the other is ruled by a despotic regime, the 10k in town A will be attacked by the 10k in town B on some pretense, real or imagined, once conflict over some resource comes into play. Towns C, D, and E will not be organized to help town A, because Anarchy.&#x200B;Anarchy is the natural state of almost every barbarian and native tribe before the monarchs and empires come knocking, and then they are simply vassels of the empire. The history of every region of the world shows this to be true, a thousand times over.  \--------------------------------------------ConstructiveThe solution to these problems is a proto-system tailored to embrace and exploit the guess and check paradigm inside a VERY loose framework of interdependence. "Constructive" is a system designed to allow a population of 10 or 10 billion to cooperate towards the efficient construction of a system which MAXIMIZES the amount of support among the population it is composed of. It does this in a very simple, rational way, and it is designed to be quickly modified as new information becomes available.  Constructive can be implemented with computers on a blockchain, but it is not dependent on technology to function. Some people don't want to be dependent in whole or even in part on some system of 1's and 0's they don't understand.  Any time you join a group in free association, there will be a set of rules/codes that define the benefits and responsibilities of members of that group. If you join a complex group, like /r/conspiracy, there are rules you follow, and you probably don't like all the rules. If you find a group where you agree with ALL the rules, that group almost certainly has one member... You.  For all real world groups, you will agree with some percentage of the rules, in order to receive the benefits, and in a very good group, that number is WAAAY over 50%, and your adherence to rules you disagree with is primarily performed for the good of the group and even more so for the expected benefits.  A really well functioning voluntary group will contain dozens of rules, not thousands, and you will be able to understand them all. In a great group, you will agree with 80% or 90% of the rules that you follow, and you will follow the other 10% or 20% because the benefits you gain are sufficient to make you voluntarily comply.  It stands to reason that if you make rules with the requirement that 51% of the people agree (by vote or something), then 49% of the people potentially disagree with every rule you make. This can result in a system where every rule you agree with is paired with one you disagree with, and that is a crap ratio. You will think that half the rules are stupid, unproductive, or immoral, and inconsistent with your guiding principles (voluntarism).   If I propose a competing system where the only change is that 75% of the people must agree before a rule is adopted, then at the very least, you can surmise that you will agree with 3 rules for every one you disagree with. At 90%, in all probability, you will agree with 9 rules for every rule you disagree with. This is the single biggest number that affects the power of the group over the individual, because there are LOTS AND LOTS of rules that 51% agree with, and VERY, VERY FEW that 90% agree with.  It matters less whether you pass rules by representation or direct vote, but this is still important. For this choice, I would prefer a "liquid democracy" model which is mixed representation/direct vote, but I would be okay with a pure direct vote, as long as the level of required consensus is high.  Everything I've written so far is dumb simple, but it cannot be overstated that it is the most important part of the foundation that the Constructive system is designed to decide.

YES! Decentralized Blockchain Co-Ops. I really really need help and advice about where to begin working on this idea I've had for a while about something similar....As concisely as I can put this, I believe the internet can utilize Collective Consciousness via the collaborative efforts of expert participants who are active members of a hi tech, open source cooperative with physical campuses which physically make and implement the designs of the Collective Consciousness of the Open Source Co-Op.A project example could be that a CIV BLD CO-OP could implement vertical, aquaponic growing systems within greenhouses to extend the growing season for much of the country year round. Permaculture should be all over these communities as well. A project could be Tiny Home Kit Construction for the Co-Op members themselves to "Glamp", going the more high-tech route, it could be liquid fluoride thorium reactors for advanced alt-nuclear sustainable power, setting up tidal power or solar systems. The experiences that could be gained are only limited by the creative and collaborative power of an organized and activist-oriented open source internet co-op.But wait, there's more... I'm interested in harnessing the incentivizing technology of Proof of Value (like backfeed.cc) or Proof of Cooperation (like faircoin) cryptocurrency to encourage voluntary participation of members to assist in the creation and Technical design of these hi tech, socially uplifting Co-Op projects. Blockchain technology is amazing, and I already have an open-source algorithm which could be used to log in user value which would just need a little work. Such a Proof of Value Cryptocurrency in this context could encourage the digital and physical collaboration of participants. POVC would essentially allow members to verify the value the others provide in their participation swith the Co-Op, which creates the currency based on the incremental value added to these socially uplifting projects. I believe that POVC would incentivize and multiply the collaborative power and influence of Co-Ops around the globe, incorporating technological methods of investment and asset growth to socially uplifting projects so that these members can actually gain wealth doing projects that help others. Members receive the increased value of their invested currency as more members participate.Co-Op Members could participate in collaborative research and project development using a social-media like interface, where Co-Op members can actively communicate and submit co-edited (something like) google-spreadsheets to work towards a predetermined and collaboratively specified goal for that work meeting. Think of this as like a google hangout meeting to work on a project, where verified members log their hours, corroborating, verifying, and rating the participation of their co-members. Physical Coop Campuses could be set up as emulation chambers, physically bringing manifest and LIFE to the designs and schematics of an international body of participating experts. We need to use the collaborative technologies of WIKI-style web 2.0 with Social Media that is absolutely conscious and directed to complete goals for the betterment of all of the Co-Op members.Cooperating with others is where you put your soul's work out there, putting your passion into doing work that uplifts those also working to help you. It is also very spiritually and mentally rewarding. I sincerely believe with all my heart that much of the welfare, drug abuse and mental health challenges hing on the lack of community that individuals placed in unfortunate economic situations are situated in. WE, as the Agora need to MAKE CIVILIZATION BUILDING CO-OPS so that individuals have a place to gain mentorship and valuable experience while also being sufficiently rewarded based on the value of that individual's merit and participation. I have a vision that Open Source, Campus Co-Ops can make greedy corporations and inept governments obsolete. Where do I begin? 

Wouldn‚Äôt taking the financial system away from people who know double entry bookkeeping and giving that power to people who know computer theory cause a relatively large group to be replaced by a relatively smaller group (based on the relatively simpler math involved)?I have some small acquaintance with computer programmers. Don‚Äôt do it.

You have a way with words, sir.  This is the most clearly and impactful ive seen the message written.I even felt a feeling of hope while reading your comment

It's no use. The Fed will shut down the blockchain if it gets too powerful. They already announced that they have the power to track down private key identities. It won't be too long now before we see Holodomor 2.0. The Federal Reserve does its best to exist in perpetuity, enslaving more and more while the two dominant gangs fight for quasi control to keep everyone distracted. Slavery too will be perpetual. It's no use to look for alternatives, we will die and our estates will be taxed and given to the Fed. 

Nom aggression principle for the win! Otherwise known as Natural Law, Golden Rule... etc. 

1) End Zionists.

> Step 1. Abolish the Federal ReserveThat's anti-Semitic!!!

> Step 3. Create a new court system to prosecute those who created the financial and environmental disasters of the last 100 years. Ex post facto bills of attainder are probably not the best way to kick off our new super society and they‚Äôre pointlessly vengeful. If you can just stop the pollution and the cheating there‚Äôs no need. Don‚Äôt punish people for participating in the last broken society if you‚Äôre making a new one- declare amnesty and move on. Only bad things can come from the deprivation of due process- witch hunts, civil conflict, systemic barbarism, etc. Your favorite scapegoat might not be mine so what happens when everyone is 2 steps away from punishable traitor? It‚Äôs easy to see a corrupt person with authority using that to remove whoever they want.

That was a great talk

Highly recommend the Public Banking Institute for anyone interested in reducing the power of Wall Street. 

We also need to get in there when the budding psychopath is a child, because at that point there is still a chance at some semblance of rehabilitation. When we try to rehabilitate fully grown psychopaths they only become all the more deviant, as if it's a game to them to see how well they can convince you that they've changed for the better while really going in the opposite direction.

I disagree.  Children have tons of empathy, but the system beats it out of you.  Today's money-driven world is all about putting yourself before others.  No one is gonna look out for you, so you're forced to look out for yourself.  Empathy isn't going to pay rent, put food on the table, or generate a livelihood in the world we live in.  Instead of hoping that empathy is going to change the world, we should focus on changing the system that rewards sociopathy and punishes empathy.  

What about encouraging kids to become politicians? It seems that politician is such a dirty word that sociopaths end up running rather than ethical working folks.

I think it‚Äôs materialism that does this. Humility has been a virtue in every successful society throughout history except those about to fall (Egypt/Rome/us). We lost our humility because we made it the ultimate good to have things. New is always better which leads to throwaway culture in relationships and politics as well as just possessions. Sociopathy is a manageable trait in most societies, there‚Äôs a reason we in particular struggle with it.

I think we have plenty of empathy these days to be honest. It's used as a political tactic to promote bad policies like gun control and open borders. A non-politically biased and non-postmodern education in history, economics and other subjects is absolutely essential in not growing up to be a resentful, angry, fact-less, skill-less person (source: am millennial. I managed to accomplish this but most of my generation has not.)

How to ‚Äòassemble‚Äô a computer.  You don‚Äôt want to manufacture a computer from scratch. FTFYUnless you meant the type that don‚Äôt use microchips and transoceanic cables. Those will be either extremely rare and expensive or practically worthless, as they are already proving to be even in such a discussion like this.We would do best using word of mouth and face to face for all the important stuff - just in case a fire. Note: if you‚Äôre prone to take that sentence seriously... it‚Äôs probably a fire. What would the pre-crime unit call it: conspiracy to commit conspiracy on a social network site called ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù?

Poverty is omni present. You cannot eradicate it.Not with humans atleast.

I think foreign aid in the form of cash might be beneficial. Poor people know what they need more than anyone else, and with cash in hand they can get it. Imagine what would have happened in Haiti if that half a billion dollars squandered by the Red Cross, had been put in envelopes and distributed directly to the people. I bet more than six houses would have been built. 

do you have any proof of this, or anything compelling to watch on the subject? Not questioning you, just intrigued

I wouldn't say completely end foreign aid, but certainly be *far* more discretionary with who we send it to, and with the type of aid that we send. This includes charity organizations as well.

Many people are poor for reasons that money can't fix.  If you've ever watched a schizophrenic homeless person brought into the hospital for the 50th time because they stopped taking their (free) meds and in acute psychosis, you would understand this.Many people are poor in ways that CAN be fixed, but we'll never completely eradicate poverty.Half the population has an IQ less than 100.  Many have an IQ less than 80.  Money doesn't fix this.

Foreign aid is a tiny fraction of a percent of the budget and is mostly used for political clout. For reasons completely separate from foreign aid, abject poverty is massively down and education is massively up. This just isn‚Äôt really an issue.

"respect the earth" Instant upvote from me! 

Except humans are flawed to the core.Doesn't matter how much parenting you do if your own beliefs are wrong in the first place.

While the democracies of the world accept political "donations", or allow outside parties to advertise for campaigns, it will never truly be free.We need politicians to be upright and for the people, and not for their own gains. Be it cash now, failing to do anything about out of control housing prices because they have investment properties,  giving favours to connected people or even leveraging their position for a job after office.The world has gotten so much worse since we became more greedy, and politicians are the worst as they are favouring money over people

FYI "progressive" is not synonymous with "liberal", and "liberal" and "conservative" are not parties (hence the term "nonpartisan" does not apply to them).

> to whomever it may concern, know this: the general public is intentionally being eased into a distrustful and a conspiratorial worldview. Questionable events are deliberately staged and made to appear suspicious, for the purpose that people will investigate, following bread crumb trails laid out in psyops on the internet and organizing around them. Wow. That is an interesting theory. The false flags have been especially sloppy lately, and they're finally getting some traction in places that normies will see them (Tucker Carlson on Las Vegas, for example).I'm not sure that I agree that it's all about bringing people into demonic occultism, at least not on a conscious level for the people that are exposing the false flags. Many of them are Christians, and the rest are mostly "light" occultists, who don't see themselves as consciously following demons, although they often are.

part 2simply because they are your relatives - if someone has hurt you forgive them, but if they continue with their unconsciousness, you do not need to keep them in your life. Free your own mind and improve your own life and you will slowly (or quickly) find new people and communities that resonate with your greater awareness (I can tell you this is true from my personal experience - it can take a while, but as you grow, some people will grow with you, while others will not and you will find others that you resonate with more in that moment/period of your life).-Create and give birth to something new. Creativity is crucial for a new Earth to flourish. In whatever way you feel moved to, create. Whether you enjoy writing, singing, dancing, painting, talking.... use your creative energy to make the world better, to bring light and awareness to various issues, to spread freedom, love and joy, as well as to express yourself and bring your own darkness to light.-Consider spending more time in nature. Reconnecting to nature will give you a greater love for this planet, for both humanity and the rest of the biosphere. You will feel yourself more a part of nature, rather than as a separate human trying to conquer it (the idea that has caused so much suffering to humanity).-Have compassion. One of the main reasons humanity is where it is, is a lack of compassion. There is a small group of individuals, that we could call psychopaths or sociopaths who do not have this empathy. This is a tiny minority, but most of these people are in the vast majority of positions of power. Thus the system is the way it is, because it is designed by those that lack compassion and THAT is reverberated throughout the whole society we live in. Practice looking at others with a perspective of compassion, empathy, looking at it through their eyes, noting how their intention might be different than their actions...practice compassion, primarily for yourself, then for those closest to you and ultimately for all living beings. You will be much happier and at peace with yourself and others, your relationships will be far better and more harmonious and you will be doing a great service to the whole of humanity. Accept yourself unconditionally, that is the doorway to self-compassion.-Be aware. It is from this that everything else stems from and it is in this that everything ends. If you become more aware of what is actually happening around you and focus less on the preconceived mental/emotional abstractions that color your world (and are often wrong), you will see things like never before. As they say in Zen, you will look at things with a beginner's mind. Becoming aware will make you intuitively discern things with far greater ease. When you are not trying to control your mind and your incessant thinking, you will find that your mind is far more lucid and cooperative. By moving your awareness beyond your limiting thoughts, you will find insights and truths, as well as inner peace and freedom you did not even imagine ever could exist. Being aware is the key. You are either entrapped in your thoughts or you are aware of them. You do not need to stop your limiting thoughts, all you need to is become aware of them. You do not need to stop your thinking, just become aware that you are constantly thinking. Awareness is the light that shines into the darkness and transforms it into itself. You just have to let it.-Consider that there might be more to life than the physical. Here I am delving into territory that might not be for all, as beliefs and convictions are strong in people‚Äôs minds when it comes to the topic of spirituality. When it comes to this, you should not believe a thing, but always test everything out and see what is true for you. Curiosity and a desire for freedom are the things that will make you inspect yourself and reality, closer than you have done so far. Although reading about this topic can be insightful, I strongly recommend the practical approach. Find a spiritual practice, a form of meditation, prayer, perhaps a chant, a form of introspection, that you resonate and resonates with you ‚Äì and see where it takes you. My perspective on this goes as follows - Fundamentally, you will notice that there is a freedom, a joy, a love, that stems from the silence, from the space, from the absolution of our reality. It is always here now, yet unnoticed. This beingness is the core of all there is and is the source of you as well. Become aware of the silence, the stillness and the emanation of even the faintest peace, love or joy in this very moment. This is incredibly simple, but not easy, as your mental programming will take your attention back to the inner fog. Embrace the stillness and it will grow. This, in my opinion, is the most important and fastest way to change yourself and the world. Embracing the freedom, the stillness and following its light will lead you to action and results that will be massively beneficial for yourself and the world.Trust in Life, it knows the way and it is ultimately not separate from who you are.________________________________________(if you want to know more of my perspective, especially on the points pertaining to inner peace, freedom and spirituality, you can also check out my blog ‚Äì embraceyourexperience.com) ________________________________________I wish you all a pleasant day and a wonderful life :)

Environment for human success but also the individual. So much is bunched up to help success but it is a fragile success. A difficult success by individuals is a more sound foundation for government or corporate governance. 

As per generating money from energy.... Money isn't even real, money is printed out of thin air by a select few, and distrubuted to slaves.

Excellent article/study. I've joked about this concept for years with my work friends.Also, this is a sad-funny image that describes the first part of this century perfectly:https://fineartamerica.com/featured/a-man-and-3-children-sit-around-a-fire-tom-toro.html

 

The Mayan calendar ending signaled an end to the old and a beginning of a new epoch

This is why the REAL problem is a lack of empathy. Empathy is the inbuilt tool that can save us if we can find a way to value it more than anything else and a way to ensure those without it (sociopaths) are never allowed power.

Finally something that isn't political parroting, thanks!

>The solution is exposing these deaths, preventing more from happening in the future, and exposing the false flag operations that have haunted our development throughout history.well said.

Yup. This.

Sounds a little like Barret Browns pursuance project. Co-ops do have huge potential, I think that's the non-corporate solution everyone is longing for.

>We need social media 2.0 like collaborative web2.0 where digital cooperative groups collaborate in their R&D efforts to make projects that help people.wouldn't hurt :)

Well... Good luck with all that.  You're trying to use the system to beat the system.  Even IF you win... It's still THE SYSTEM.  You haven't changed shit.  That's like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.If you still think you can vote yourself free, you haven't been paying attention.

I saw the gleam of a new Era get demolished by the need for wealth. I'm starting to think humans are incapable of peace. We might have a small portion of the population that is able to see how things can be better but a whole lot of people are drenched in the kool-aid, those born into old money and those that have succeeded with the help of already successful people. It's in us on a Fundamental level. 

Organized religion is the biggest tool of mental and spiritual enslavement in the history of mankind.  It's a problem, not a solution.

&#x200B;AnCap vs AnCom vs Anarchy - Constructive in action  1000 Anarchists land on a verdant desert island. 1/3 want anarchocapitalism, 1/3 want anarchy with limited personal property, and 1/3 want a purely anarchic system. If you go to an Anarchy group, you will see that these three subgroups definitely exist, and they almost never agree on some major points. What, then, to do?  The first and most pernicious problem is how to divide political control over the land. The best way to divide the land is clever, but simple. We will divide control over the land randomly among all one thousand Anarchists. Every man, woman and child gets a share, but this will result in some people "lucking out" and getting shoreline or high ground, and some unlucky people getting land in the swamp. In order to statistically even out the utility of all the land, we divide the land into 100-10,000 times as many parcels as there are people. Each person will get \~1000 different claims to random pieces of land. Every person will have 100 pieces of prime land, 800 pieces of average land, and 100 pieces of crappy swamp.  Land can be traded and leased for up to 100 years at a time, so people and groups can trade to consolidate areas to serve as commons, town centers, or other large utility districts, but only for 100 years, at which time all leases must be renegotiated. Title falls to next of kin, evenly divided in the same random fashion (but with a smaller number of splits or no splits). Payment for leases must be paid in a way that is amortized over the length of the contract. In this way, you cannot bring a person into the world without some claim to a piece of the Earth they inhabit. Similarly, if you have TONS of kids, they will enter this land with a smaller share than you had, so it provides an economic pressure to control population, naturally.  For pre-existing land with existing owners, land is divided in the same way, but the current owners get an automatic free lease for 25 years, and they can negotiate a 100 year lease with the new perpetual owners.  Land is the toughest part, and there are other ways to do this, but the manner here outlined is superior to all other mechanisms I have chanced on.  Next, groups declare their guiding principles, and accept members. Everything is voluntary, and you can live on the island without being a member of any group. If you have no group, then any disputes will be arbitrated customarily, depending on the customs/rules/norms of the person you have a dispute with.  The anarchist will have a group similar to this:  There are no rules. The guiding principle is voluntarism. Personal property is respected with regard to natural law and the voluntary principle. You can contract with people. You can do what you want on your own property. Arbitrate disputes as you see fit.The AnCaps will have something similar, but they will add a few things:  1. All defense and enforcement is funded by a single, simple 5% tax, which you are required to pay (like a consumption tax).  2. All expenditures from taxed funds are required to have the support of 80%+ of the payers of the tax. If you pay twice as much, you have twice as much say. If you pay no tax, you have no say.  3. All disputes are arbitrated by a double blind, random arbitration. 80% of the judgment jury must agree, without deliberation, to impose any remedy.   4. If called for jury duty, you must attend or you are penalized.  5. If you pollute, you have to pay the required effluent charge.  6. Any person may utilize our dispute arbitration process once per year for free, whether or not they are members of the group.  7. No member may have sex with a minor of more than three years age difference.  8. All enforcers are chosen by lottery for a one year term. No person can serve for two consecutive years. All interactions are recorded and are available to the parties interacted with. All enforcement happens in pairs, with pairs determined randomly for one week periods.9-25. Other small laws, concerning excessive noise, pets, biological engineering, excessive weapons stockpiling, nuclear energy and freedom of travel.  The AnComs will have similar rules, but in joining, you give a lease to your personal property to the group for the duration of your membership.  Constructive additionally has the rule:  If you violate a rule in a group, you are allowed to appeal any punishment by the group to the general population. If the population finds that the activity does not warrant punishment, the worst the group can do is expulsion from the group and exile from included property.  Groups can make agreements with each other (treaties), and can be inclusive or exclusive at the whim of the members.  TLDR, Constructive is a system by which you can choose the parameters of cooperation among people. It does not prescribe Anarchy or any flavor of Anarchy. It allows San Francisco to try a full communist system, while Sacramento embraces a direct democracy, with Texas operating as a republic, and it lays out the rules for interoperation between these groups. It allows "guess and check" in the purest form, and does not predict what will be successful.  If San Francisco succeeds, Communism will spread. When it fails, it will start to resemble a more decentralized system with private property (with limits, because San Francisco). Over time, it will result in 10,000 distinct systems with a means for them to peacefully interact.  This is LONG, but it is MUCH shorter than the book I wrote on the matter, if anyone is interested.  The system is as simple as possible, but no simpler. It can work in Iran, Israel, the Congo or Hawaii. Every aspect of this system is volutary. If anything involuntary is added, it is by the express will of a BIG majority of the participants. It recommends against simple majority rule (strongly) and representatives by election (strongly). It embraces approval voting, range approval voting, and proportional approval voting. It allows scored and ranked voting, and recommends against plurality voting. It is a set of questions that members must answer to form a cogent system, but it says nothing about what answers must be embraced. It always has a parachute clause to call a meeting to reconsider the whole system or parts of it. It can resolve the issue of whether abortion is murder for a particular population, while allowing a different population to select a different answer. I strongly believe I know the right answer for this issue, so I believe that over time, 90% of us will come down on the right side of this choice.  Fin

Congrats. You just got more than forty thousand worthless slips of paper that have enslaved humanity since 1913. 

Here's your problem, and our (the 'good' people) salvation.  The majority of people are 'good willed'.  Meaning that the majority of people (~ 70.5% - 85% of the American populace), according to a statement made by [Andrew Cuomo](https://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/aug/18/andrew-cuomo/yes-one-three-us-adults-have-criminal-record/), are not 'criminals'.  I would suggest that 'criminals' are people that violate the NAP for gain or out of negligence. > The Census Bureau lists the adult population in the United States at 249.4 million. That means the FBI considers about 29.5 percent of adults to have a criminal record.As the article concludes, 29.5% is an extremely biased number.  Are all crimes people are charged with really crimes?  And of these crimes committed, how many are fake, or inaccurate?  I would argue that most people, 85%, are 'good' natured people that are not inclined to want to harm others.I believe that the majority of people on this planet will aline with the Non-aggression Principle, once they are made aware of the idea of self ownership.  The Non-aggression Principle is incompatible with the existence of an assassination market.  Those that agree with the NAP have the legal and moral right to intervene with use of force, if they know it to exist.  If the 'good' people find it, you're the target... And we way out number you.  It's the natural checks and balances of society.  Those type of systems will rise, and we'll knock em the fuck down.

But what if your species really is better at ‚Äúmoral growth‚Äù than any other asset? Would the materially unsuccessful strategy of kindness linked to self-sacrifice be the most advanced weapon to use to preserve material existence in this or any related reality?

Removed. Advocating violence. 

Not sure why you're getting downvoted.  Might be that it's a bit too technical for most, it is a bit detailed, and people just gloss over.I gave you an upvote.  Don't really have a directed comment other than this... I mean, I am working on a project of my own.What kind of help do you need?  Your rocket ship looks massive!  How can I be of assistance?

I read your ideas with intent, and I definitely believe you are on a good path of thinking. This is the kind of stuff the elite DO NOT WANT US DOING OR EVEN CONCEIVING OF. Keep. It. Up. I believe if you wanted to make this happen for yourself- you may want to consider making an app that illustrates the vision in a simple and engaging manner, then you could allow people to sign in through the app, create forums about the topics; slowly crowdfunding the ideas- recruit small teams to build the proof of concept in select cities. Eventually, it could grow into a company/community/hub for events, infrastructure and eventually entire towns rendered by open-source technology, crowdfunding and engineering. I‚Äôd love to help any way that I can! I have an extensive background in marketing/social media video advertising, and I am currently obtaining my degree in electrical engineering. Send me a pm to chat! 

> I have some small acquaintance with computer programmers. Don‚Äôt do it.XD> Wouldn‚Äôt taking the financial system away from people who know double entry bookkeeping and giving that power to people who know computer theory cause a relatively large group to be replaced by a relatively smaller group (based on the relatively simpler math involved)?This is why open-source is so vitally important.  As society evolves, more people will join the ranks in knowledge.  The 'good' out number the bad, and I believe the natural checks and balances of society will prevail.  There's no putting that genie back into the bottle.

Maybe...I'll at least try.  Better odds.

Don't need to shut it down if they can control it.Blockchain as it is , is simply not the answer. 

I see your point. But this is a public safety issue. For the worst cases, we're talking people who have murdered not one person, not two, not 10 or 20, not 100, not 1000, not 10,000, but *hundreds of thousands of people.* MILLIONS, in some cases. Why? For money and power.If we gave em life in prison, they could bribe their way out. For sure. Then we have monsters on the loose again. Sorry, but there's only one way to solve this.

I think maybe they just mean a justice system that isn't already bought and paid for by the very people who would've been prosecuted already if in fact there was a true justice system

Plenty of sociopaths become very capable doctors and lawyers.  Sociopathy is not necessarily a problem, providing it is well controlled.

>  Children have tons of empathyNo they don't. Children are the true representation of our base desires and actions, not constrained by the rules and regulations of a modern society because they don't know about them yet. They'll form cliques and put down anybody that doesn't fit their little world view. I'm pretty sure getting bullied for the color of my skin wasn't because the system "beat it out of them". It's because it's human nature, and you can't legislate against it.

It's not just political power that they seek. They become CEOs, they join the military, they become police officers, they become teachers, they become medical practitioners... Any position in which a person can have power over other living beings is going to be a target for them.

Here's a post I made about a Manly P Hall lecture that talk's about this:  https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8d3gzw/a_new_world_order

 

Can you educate me?

why not :)

There are several proposals in this thread that are capable of ending poverty as a matter of economics. That is, we can produce enough for everyone to have plenty. Then it just becomes a matter of getting rid of the oligarchy seeking to maintain disparities of wealth with no basis in merit.

Poverty is easy to eradicate with money. Want to help poor people? Give them money so they're less poor! It's an easy and economically sound idea.

> Not questioning youYou should.  I don't have any proof.  It's just my theory.

Why do you think *some* foreign aid is advisable or necessary and if state and corporate charity was made illegal what portion of your income would you devote to these causes and why?I am just curious and I want to test my supposition.

>Money doesn't fix this.My point exactly.  So let's not send any.  At all.

Yay

So read, listen and better yourself so you're fit for such a task. Politely talk about philosophy and other deep ideas with people you know. There are so many options for broadening one's knowledge nowadays. You can't control other people or world events but you can control what you do and how people around you feel. 

It doesn't take perfection, it just takes respect and caring.Some years ago I was more or less regarded as a "child whisperer" in my extended family, able to get children to obey in situations where they were notoriously "difficult". My secret? I treated them like people.

I agree. A lot of the linked groups are working on that. 

Yes, I agree and generally use the words that way, but was quickly trying to express it in a way people would understand. Probably should have taken longer to think and write this. 

>As per generating money from energy....Would you understand the importance of u/5dreality's proposal better if you replaced 'money' with 'value'? Generating more value from more energy...?A higher energy throughput economy is a must if we want to make the world a better place.

Money is only a medium of exchange. But energy exists, and is a commodity with real value. If you increase your supply of energy, you increase the total wealth of your nation.Putting the energy to use can create more tangible wealth. Think of burning petroleum in a tractor to harvest food from a field. You're turning a source of energy into food (in an indirect sense).Nuclear power and fusion will also reduce the [volume of fuel](https://larouchepac.com/sites/default/files/EFD-chart-BLD_1.jpg) needed to do work. This is no small accomplishment, as the ages of humanity's progress can be measured by their harnessing progressively more advanced forms of energyDraft animals pulling plows freed enough labor for cities to form.Steam power enabled large quantities of goods to be carried more quickly than horses could pull them.The steam age enabled development of liquid fuels, which enabled many people to have a personal transportation system (car) capable of going carrying them at least 100 times faster than their legs, and enabled us to send rockets into space.Just imagine what we could do with nuclear rockets, cars powered by mini thorium reactors, and so on.

That'd be better than what we have now. But better still to have healthy bodies. Generally speaking, we can do this ourselves.

The Mayan calendar won't end for another 300 years.

> You're trying to use the system to beat the system. Even IF you win... It's still THE SYSTEM. You haven't changed shit. That's like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.You aren't going to suddenly change the system. Violence begets violence. There's no magic bullet that will solve all the woes we face- hard work, organization, that is the only thing that will save us.> If you still think you can vote yourself free, you haven't been paying attention.You yourself are buying into the lie. The vote was the great concession of the Elite's. The one thing they gave the Plebs, in full belief that they could manipulate the masses and even the vote. But the greatest flaw is mass action and organization- they can only stuff ballots so much. Through grassroots organization real change can happen.Everything else is just feel good words and platitudes while the Elite's still maintain power and we talk and talk and talk, accomplishing nothing. Why do you think they panic when we Primary them? Why do you think they try to hide the Precinct meeting dates? Not because voting is irrelevant, but because voting is *dangerous* to them when done in an organized fashion.

"All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but [they shared everything they had.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4&version=NRSVCE)  With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God‚Äôs grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales  and put it at the apostles‚Äô feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need."

 

 

Man those simple words of encouragement mean so much. DM incoming! 

I believe technology must become more human and less digital if it is to help the many instead of the few, but isn‚Äôt that possibility precluded by blockchain? It‚Äôs an extremely inelegant solution to the problem of knowing.

> Blockchain as it is , is simply not the answer.Which is why people are working at making it better.  Blockchain tech has been around for almost a decade and it is still in comparative infancy.  It was not a perfect-formed solution when it was created, and it is not perfect now.  However, as it grows and develops, it will become more of a solution to the problems of establishing trust relationships independent of government (thereby making the institution of government both redundant and unnecessary).

Blockchain is just another step in the grand Agenda of the Central Banks. If people really think that this form of currency can be truly *decentralized* I think those people are delusional.

Regardless you shouldn't go back and prosecute people for things you're just now making illegal, which is what they said.

You're both partially right. Some kids have excellent empathy, some kids are absolute nightmares. Barring any disorders, this difference is pretty much exclusively the result of their upbringing. The little shits learn to be awful from their parents, and then society rewards that behavior by making it easier to get ahead through stepping on others, further reinforcing it. The empathetic children are the ones getting stepped on, so they learn to put up a barrier around themselves and stop being so open-hearted.

> No they don't. Children are the true representation of our base desires and actions, not constrained by the rules and regulations of a modern society because they don't know about them yet. They'll form cliques and put down anybody that doesn't fit their little world view. I'm pretty sure getting bullied for the color of my skin wasn't because the system "beat it out of them". It's because it's human nature, and you can't legislate against it.You think there's no empathy within their little cliques?  Children develop contextual empathy because that is a necessary skill in our society.

The reverse is also true.  The sensation of power *produces sociopathic behavior* in otherwise-normal people.

>People's ability to truly imagine themselves in the position of others is way below what it should be.Says who, and how do you quantify what it should be?  I'd say that today the average person has more empathy for others than ever before.  I believe this is due in part to the advent of the internet.  In previous generations, people were only really concerned about their neighbors, family, and friends.  Basically, their immediate surroundings.  This was due to their lack of access to knowledge about other people half a world away.  Today, that knowledge is at their fingertips.People ignore the plight of others not because they lack empathy.  They ignore it because it hurts.  Empathy has a physical response, and seeing people suffer is not a pleasant feeling.  Caught up in their own lives, trials, and tribulations most people choose to ignore what they can't control and focus on what they can.‚ÄãThe problem stems from people not believing that their action, alone, can change anything.  It's the ole, "What can I do?  I'm just one person."‚Äã 

There always will be someone at the lowest.Sure more reseources would mean the minimum standard of living would go up.But people would still be poor.If you rank a grade of 50 students. There is always a lowest rank.Sure the entire class may have scored 95%+.

Except that doesn't really work in practice.For example, approximately 70% of lottery winners go broke in a few years, according to[ National Endowment for Financial Education](http://time.com/4176128/powerball-jackpot-lottery-winners/).> About 70 percent of people who suddenly receive a windfall of cash will lose it within a few years.Giving people money is not a solution to poverty.  Teaching people to be responsible with the money they have, and allowing people to keep their money (extinction of compulsory taxation) is a way better solution.

Its a fucking retarded idea.A train always has a last compartment.

Effective foreign aid should lower the number of migrants clamoring to enter wealthier nations, where they usually only exacerbate local poverty and crime. It's cost-inefficient to just keep sending them back where they came from, so the ideal thing is to help them improve their situation at home enough that they no longer feel the need to leave. It's a win/win so long as the aid offered is actually effective.How much I'd be willing to devote depends on the type of aid in question, but a combination of local and foreign aid could get a good 50% out of me if it seemed properly efficient.

That came out wrong :D

Nice,The best way to do it would be to some form of capped and audited public funding for campaigning. I would gladly give up a little bit extra from my pay packet if it meant political donations by individuals or businesses were now illegal.In the US you have a stuffed system I've seen figures where it cost Obama ~$1.04 billion to win, and Romney $994 million to lose. I just can't see where the money goes (apart from the trough), but that means there are a lot of favours that need cashing in...

His post is all about producing energy and selling it....  How bout, energy just becomes a basic need for all of humanity?

>Money is only a medium of exchange  I agree with that...  What I don't agree with is selling the energy.  Energy should be viewed as a basic human right, it comes from our home afterall.  Wether it be gas, electricity, thorium, whatever, money is not what brings any of that into existence.  There is 2 things I would like to see in our future, the first is a Universal Basic Income, and the second would be a Universal Basic Living.UBL would = food, power, shelter and education.  This is how we end poverty and suffering worldwide.

It ended in 2012

> Through grassroots organization real change can happen.You're absolutely correct, and in my opinion, you should build that rocket ship!  Meaning, work on your solution and build it to the greatest height you can achieve.  I personally believe it's foolish and fruitless, but who the fuck am I?I wish you well in your venture, it seems like a lot of work.  Meanwhile, I'll be ignoring all that BS and build my solution (rocket ship).  It's always good to have a plan B.Basically, there's no one way towards freedom.  It's going to take all of us doing what we can to free ourselves.  If you feel that you have to jump through all those ~~hopes~~ hoops (Freudian slip) to declare yourself free, have at it.I already know I own myself, and that's enough for me.

> But how does an intervention through application of force morally align itself with a principle of non-aggression ?The [NAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle), In contrast to pacifism, does not forbid forceful defense. If you violate the NAP, force is justified.  Assassinations violate the NAP, pretty simple.The rest are all great questions no one has the answers to.  Guess we gotta give a try to find out.

Your proposed future echoes previous attempts in recent history to throw off an elite few hierarchs by the many who hunger for more. It often turns mean. The centre cannot hold.

> but isn‚Äôt that possibility precluded by blockchain?I wouldn't say the possibility is precluded at all by blockchain tech.  In fact, I think it's a precursor to a Decentralized Autonomous Digital Organism.  Think of it, millions of computers working together to weave an intricate pattern to be used as independent personalities.  If processing power is the bottleneck today.  It won't be in 20 years.Blockchain tech has just learned to craw, give it some time to mature.  

Its not. It will always be controlled by the rich.Be it the government. Or rich "independent" entities who "donate" the most processing power.

Exactly.Banks will buy crypto out if it ever becomes relevant.Why destroy something if you can control it for your own needs

/u/WindCanBlowMe gets it. That is exactly my reasoning./u/Griff_Steeltower explain to me how redistribution of wealth to pay for free housing, food, and energy is, as you put it, "pointlessly vengeful"? Pollution is already illegal. There is a vast amount of proof they just get away with it. Banking criminals walk free openly admitting to the crimes. Im not making up new laws and cherry picking people. These extravagant psychopaths have to much wealth and no moral understanding of the power that comes with that wealth. Im not advocating violence ~~or even to lock them up.~~ The rest of us need some of that wealth to save the human race and eventually all life on Earth and this solar system.-edit I am advocating to lock them up

You should spend some time on twitter if you think the internet is making people more empathetic.

You are defining *poor*, differently than how it should be. The issue is, poverty as defined, means inferior in quality *or* insufficient amount of. They should not be mutually exclusive. There are many ways we can use technology to end insufficiencies in the world.  

> Teaching people to be responsible with the money they have, and allowing people to keep their money (extinction of compulsory taxation) is a way better solution.And if people literally have no money? In Haiti hundreds of thousands of people lost *everything*. They're not going to benefit from money management classes and a tax holiday. They need food, water, shelter, and enough dignity and hope to carry on. Also I think its offensive to suggest, for instance, that a mother with a flattened home and three hungry children can't figure out on her own how best to manage her resources. There seems to be a really paternalistic attitude in the west regarding poor people--as though the reason they're poor is because they're ignorant or stupid, and not for the real reasons like failed domestic political systems, interference from foreign governments, predatory multinationals etc. etc. 

If the last compartment contains people with enough food, clean water, shelter, and medical care to live long, healthy lives, then who gives a shit?There's always going to be people that are poor relative to others, but it doesn't mean their lives need be brutal, nasty, and short.

> It's cost-inefficient to just keep sending them back where they came fromYou can solve this fairly quickly by retracting our troops from losing wars and deploying them to protect our borders from invasion.  I think this is also a solution to:>Effective foreign aid should lower the number of migrants clamoring to enter wealthier nations, where they usually only exacerbate local poverty and crime.You don't have to let them in.>How much I'd be willing to devote depends on the type of aid in question, but a combination of local and foreign aid could get a good 50% out of me if it seemed properly efficient.I have a different value system I think.  I don't believe a single dime produced by my labor should be given in foreign aid whether through my tax dollars or my own volition until everyone I share my country with has the best possible quality of life.Further, I would say that it should be a localized hierarchy of recipients.  I will not give to the city until my neighbors are cared for, nor my state until my city is cared for, etc.I think this is the way to a better world. 

What did?

There was a study by the conservative / libertarian Cato Institute that said corporate welfare was costing each American taxpayer around $6000 a year. Rather that go to candidates and get rid of the crony capitalism. 

Ultimately, yes, but you gotta start somewhere.

I've explained the best way to dramatically increase the supply of energy on earth, which is the best way to create the surplus needed for the universal basic income you desire.

Poverty and suffering is a much more complicated issue than Money as a medium of exchange.  One of the biggest factors in poverty/suffering is the "Overton Window".  Its a mirage of what a certain person or groups of people want you to see.  Usually a small picture.You need a way to pay for UBL and UBI.  With a Space Elevator alone, you could use the surplus wealth to give every citizen 5k-50k a year UBI.  You need to be careful of money is bad meme.  The way our country prints money now is bad, moving to a fiat currency would solve alot of problems of quantitative easing that exists now with printing

That's by the new, false chronology. By the true chronology it won't end for another ~300 years. I believe in 2309, or close thereabouts.

> I already know I own myself, and that's enough for me.What you speak of here is a different sense of ownership. I am no slave, and I live my life in a way that I feel expresses that belief. However, I feel that if we are to make a better world, where *all* are free, then we must follow the steps I outlined- as far as this country is concerned.However, you are not wrong in working alternate paths- the one I highlight is just one among many. I wish you the best of luck on your own journey, fellow traveler. Stay safe out there. 

Watch the state shut it down. The evil state is perpetual, they will enslave every last person until everyone is a guilty prisoner. The Federal Reserve will consume anything in its path. Blockchain only provides an example of this, so I do support it, but be prepared to be hunted down. 

False.  It is already beyond the ability of governments to control.It is not the miners who control Bitcoin  Developers are also major stakeholders with controlling interests.  So are users.  There are at least three major controlling interests in Bitcoin, and if any of them fuck it up there are plenty of viable alternatives.

No I'm saying this was Their plan for a long time. With modern computing technology, rigging an economy has never been easier. 

> prosecute those who created the financial and environmental disasters of the last 100 years.Prosecute means criminally punish, not take money away. Maybe you meant sue. 

Half that shit is bots which can't feel empathy (yet) anyway.  Don't get your sociological cues from Twitter.

Do you really think the microcosm of Twitter represent the whole of the internet, and all that it's done to awaken people?  If so, you should seek to expand your horizon.Like attracts like. Edit: I'm willing to bet, on average (as a whole), humanity is more empathic due to knowledge of people's plight.  Thanks to the internet.  I mean, you care.  I care.  Most of us here on r/conspiracy care.  Most people on Reddit care.  Can't talk about Facebook, I don't use it, but I'm sure most people care there too.There are assholes all over the world, and at every point of human history.  Assholes are typically louder than most, but that doesn't mean there is a majority of them.  Or, even a very large minority of them.  It just means assholes are ... assholes.  They tend to scream, rant, and rage about things.  That's what makes them assholes.  They stick out to you because, you guessed it, they say dumbass, asshole-ish shit, and you remember it.  Most people, like 99% of humans, feel empathy to some degree.  Only about 1% of society has sociopathy. 

>  paternalistic attitude in the west regarding poor people--as though the reason they're poor is because they're ignorant or stupid, and not for the real reasons like failed domestic political systems, interference from foreign governments, predatory multinationals etc. etc. I completely understand that people/countries/ethnicities are being exploited and poverty is being forced upon them.  It's being forced upon them by governments.  This I completely understand, which brings me back to taxation.My solution was not just about education.  Which is not a 1st or 3rd world issue... ignorance of the financial/monetary system is global.  The second part of my solution plays a MASSIVE role in remedying the issues you've brought up.If people are left to self organize and spend their money, and most importantly time, on what they choose, anything is possible.  Taxation and government fuels the exploitation of the impoverished.  Don't get so caught up on semantics.  Education on how to manage money simply keeps you abundant.  The primary barrier to wealth on this planet is government (taxation). 

Its still would be brutal, nastier and shorter than guys ahead of them.Which makes them poor.

Unless you advocate shooting people, refusing entry is not free. It can cost thousands of dollars to process and deport each person depending on their method of entry, and you and I as taxpayers are the ones who usually end up footing the bill. It would be considerably cheaper in most cases to offer them aid to stay home instead of waiting to kick them out when they try to come. Solving the problem at its source is often the most cost efficient method.

And even then they have the nerve to use overseas tax havens to avoid paying tax. It's criminal that US internet providers took money to improve services but can't actually show where the improvement is. And that is not the only dodgy happening by a long shot.I've always believed that you make a profit in a country, a fair share should go to that country. And if you get funds for something, it should go into that thing, not diverted to other projects or worse shareholders . So much of what is going on doesn't pass the sniff test. But it is gotten away with because our elected officials are part of the problem (or in the pocket of corporation). Even foreign interests, whoever has money...Also, I'm Australian and we aren't better. Screw Rupert Murdoch, he has way too much influence here. We even had a federal politician so deeply indebted to the Chinese he had to stand down.

Start with a universal basic income, and a universal basic living plan.  Food, water, shelter and power should be provided to all.

>I've explained the best way to dramatically increase the supply of energy on earth, which is the best way to create the surplus needed for the universal basic income you desire.  What if we just created the surplus needed out of thin air, you know, kinda like how moneys printed now?

>You need a way to pay for UBL and UBI.  You simply print it, fiat.... Let it be....   It's really no different than it is now.

 

:-) And you as well.

How many people even know the code behind Bitcoin? Still only a very small %age of elite people.And the Users will get swayed by whatever coin has more propaganda money thrown in itself.

Ok you got me on that single detail. Oh wait. Prosecute synonyms: take to court, bring/institute legal proceedings against, bring an action against, take legal action against, **sue**, try, impeach, bring to trial, put on trial, put in the dock, bring a suit against, indict, arraignArguing semantics 101 A semantic dispute is a disagreement that arises if the parties involved disagree about the definition of a word or phrase, not because they disagree on material facts, but rather because they disagree on the definitions of a word

 

Deliberately missing the point I see.

You use force.  >It can cost thousands of dollars to process and deport each person depending on their method of entryEntry being the key word.  We prevent their entry.>It would be considerably cheaper in most cases to offer them aid to stay homeNo, it would only incentivize threatening our borders.

Prove to them that they cannot and you will solve the problem at the source.

An interesting vision. How would you go about it?

Good idea. How do you propose creating energy, food, clothing, shelter, and clean water for all of earth's inhabitants from thin air?

Well you could take it on yourself to learn the theory and the code and help distribute the knowledge but you won't.Inequality is a fact of life.  Only in death are we equal in opportunity and outcome.  If your criteria for a just monetary system is one that is owned totally equally by all, then you will simply never find it.

It's not the natural reading of the word in English and it's not what it sounded like in context, either. Synonyms =/= other definitions. Why are you so angry?

> Please don't make this political. How was I making it political?That was all you my friend.  You brought up politics and then told ME not to make it political... derp.Ok, I won't make this about politics.  Can you?

You sound like a libertarian.

First humanity unites, then we ignore the parasites out of existence, then we have work to do.  Absentee landlordship will be banned, freeing up millions apon millions of homes while bringing prices down.  It's a fact that our governments are the biggest drug traffickers in the world, so that ends, people won't have the chance to become addicts anymore.  Then scrap current monetary system, replace it with a time and energy based currency.  Money is printed out of thin air, and it always will be.  Fast food restaraunts will be banned, property seized and turned into farmland, whether indoor or outdoor, which will provide more jobs than the original fast food joints.  Education system scrapped, world politics will be taught first school year, real history and its corruption will be known to all.  Hardest part is uniting all of humanity, but it's coming.

Same way we do now, we work.

I suppose the reason I am being a cunt in this converastion, is because I want to stress how fucking easy money has been created.

It is still fiat as is, and it will be fiat when its done. Fiat is latin for "let it be", and that is exactly how money is printed today.

Even if I do, the problem still remains.You could just as well become a banker.Doesn't mean issues with banking gets solved

Childhood concussions are probably a major factor.However, that is not the point.

 

You clearly don't know what that word means.  Obviously I am suggesting violating the NAP.

Nothing wrong with creating money out of thin air if you print it at the rate your economy is growing (so you don't have a deflationary drag) and use it for righteous purposes, like alleviating human suffering.

Right, because inequality is baked into the natural world and therefore everything humans have ever done or ever will do.

Defensive?  How is questioning something that was confusing defensive?Nice job being passive-aggressive.

Wtf is an economy?  >and use it for righteous purposes, like alleviating human suffering.  The only "economy" I've ever known is filled with war, rape and sacrifice.  So why are you arguing with me? War, rape and sacrifice has been printed out of thin air for thousands of years....  

Tell me, why do you believe that the world is suddenly being changed by 1 guy who has ties to the fbi, the mafia, the jesuits and the black nobility? Ties to those that have enslaved the world for over 4000 years....  If I weren't smarter, I'd be actually be curious.  edit, suddenly being saved.......

> Tell me, why do you believe that the world is suddenly being changed by 1 guy who has ties to the fbi, the mafia, the jesuits and the black nobility?Personally, it's vecause of conversations I've had with people close to him.But there is plenty of publicly available information to confirm widespread turmoil among the ruling class. Media says nothing but bad things about Trump, British intelligence (the British Crown being one of the biggest power players on earth) opposes him, corrupt congress critters resigning, Trump attempting to pick [Mike Flynn](https://nypost.com/2016/07/05/this-brash-lieutenant-general-is-on-trumps-short-list-for-vp/) (a known anti-pedophile and whistleblower) as his VP, Mike Flynn's prosecution for trying to fight the pedo-state, the reversal in Saudi Arabia, tariffs to protect and rebuild American industry.And a lot of other things.

>Personally, it's vecause of conversations I've had with people close to him.  Makes sense...  >(the British Crown being one of the biggest power players on earth)   britain was signed over to rome in the early 1200's...  Thank's for clearing things up though, I love you.

I find it fascinating how all conspiracy theories are basically subsets of one major conspiracy.  Like this is absolutely true - if you look at institutional investors, the same companies own the industrial farm chemical manufacturers, the CPG companies that make and distribute the highly modified and processed foods, and the pharmaceutical companies to treat the chronic illnesses they cause.  And all of those largest stakeholders are banks.  Which basically leads us back to the major conspiracy which is that the world is run by a hidden group of banking elites who continuously pit different groups of humans against one another to suppress the realization of our true potential as a species and rise up.  The scientific community‚Äôs flaws are just another spoke in the big C Conspiracy wheel.

"For many years I have worked with researchers doing very careful work in [parapsychology], including a year that I spent full-time working on a classified project for the United States government, to see if we could use these abilities for intelligence gathering during the Cold War‚Ä¶. At the end of that project I wrote a report for Congress, stating what I still think is true. The data in support of precognition and possibly other related phenomena are quite strong statistically, and would be widely accepted if it pertained to something more mundane. Yet, most scientists reject the possible reality of these abilities without ever looking at data! And on the other extreme, there are true believers who base their beliefs solely on anecdotes and personal experience. I have asked the debunkers if there is any amount of data that would convince them, and they generally have responded by saying, ‚Äúprobably not.‚Äù I ask them what original research they have read, and they mostly admit that they haven‚Äôt read any. Now there is a definition of pseudo-science‚Äîbasing conclusions on belief, rather than data! When I have given talks on this topic to audiences of statisticians, I show lots of data. Then I ask the audience, which would be more convincing to you‚Äîlots more data, or one strong personal experience? Almost without fail, the response is one strong personal experience‚Ä¶. I think people are justifiably skeptical, because most people think that these abilities contradict what we know about science. They don‚Äôt, but that's the subject for a different talk!"-Jessica Utts, President of the American Statistical Association in 2016

I don't have much to add but I read a great post in /r/technology that highlighted how scientific papers get shoved behind a paywall whenever they're published in a scientific journal, having most of the money go to the journal editors while they pick and choose what gets the most publicity. This is essentially gatekeeping real advancements in science in the name of bullshit politics.  https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/9fgun1/scientific_publishing_is_a_ripoff_we_fund_the/  Then also there's factthat loads of scientific studies publish conclusions to non-reproducible experiments, leading people to false conclusions about things, and often these "predetermined" studies are funded by particular corporate interests (for example: studies funded by Monsanto that say glyphosate in roundup is safe and not a cancer risk).  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39054778

Oh man, I have a full broadside to unleash at the scientific establishment here. Science is fucked. And I know that sounds ignorant but you really have to look deeper into what science as an institution has become. It's no longer about using evidence to either prove or refute theories based on the validity of the premises like High-Priest Sagan would always preach, it's about financial influence, the defence of dogmatic ideals, and information gatekeeping.Currently in modern society, especially on communities like reddit, science is sacrosanct. People will refer to science as the be-all-end-all to an intellectual discussion/argument. Which in theory should be perfectly valid, but that's not the reality of the situation. The reality is that science has become twisted by interest groups, science journalism has descended into the realms of entertainment journalism and headline grabbing, and the university system long ago became a business. The problem with everyone's cry to science as an authority to how the cosmos works is that they no longer have a deeper understanding of the concepts they are being told about and just take the conclusions of science on blind faith, assuming that they are being told the truth. The tragically ironic part of this is that this is the exact attitude people have had to religion for centuries, something that would immediately set off the cognitive dissidence alarm in the minds of most 'rational' people. But unfortunately that's what it has become, science has taken on the ideals and attitudes of a religion, while ironically lambasting those very same ideals.But hey, I did say I had a full broadside of shit to unleash against science here so let's get to some sources. The first thing I want to strike at is science journals, the new bible for some of you. So many people cry to see proof in a respected peer reviewed journal as concrete evidence that a particular concept or theory is valid, but what if those sources are not legitimate. What if the integrity of the peer reviewed journal system long ago became compromised? [This post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9b936p/the_conspiracy_of_scientific_fraud_70_of/) has about a dozen links to respected sources which state that the peer review system has become corrupt and that false findings, skewed and cherry picked results, and straight up fraud are running rampant in scientific journals. But don't take my word for it, listen to former editors of respected publications flat out stating that *‚ÄúIt is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published"*. [See here](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf), [and here](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/). You want more sources? Check [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70qvx7/updated_list_of_proven_conspiracies_and_hidden/) and go down to the section on science. The whole system is cracked. And how about the influence of financial interests? Well there are sources [here](http://naturalsociety.com/monsanto-employee-admits-an-entire-department-exists-to-discredit-scientists/), [also here](https://www.mintpressnews.com/news-latest-headlines-facbook-twitter-googlepluse-0-shares-monsanto-faked-data-for-approvals-claims-its-ex-chief/213562/) that explain how companies such as Monsanto have entire departments whose job it is to either discredit research or skew studies. I won't even bother trying to find sources talking about the energy industry warping the perception of climate change and sciences because they are almost too numerous!! It doesn't end there, how about the very core of what our belief structures as a society are based on? What about sacred theories such as evolution? Which [hundreds of scientists](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2018/08/02/500-renowned-scientists-jointly-share-why-they-reject-darwins-theory-of-evolution/) no longer feel is valid in explaining the origins of life on earth. Or how about history, where the established idea of how civilisation has formed is no longer accurate based on geological evidence, studies such as [this](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180201173251.htm) which call into question the ancient history of mankind we are all told is true. Not to mention the work by men such as Graham Hancock and Robert Duval. If you want books you can read works such as *Worlds in Collision* by Immanuel Velikovsky and *Cataclysm: Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C* by D S Allan and J B Delair, which will completely change the way you think about ancient history. All results of a scientific establishment that has become dogmatic and rigid in what they will allow to be changed about established beliefs. This is just the tip of the iceberg. If you start digging you can find an enormous amount of testimonials from academics about how universities decide what they can and can't study, how fields like anthropology and astronomy will ruin the careers of those who go against the established belief structure. Fuck, if you really want to see evidence of how the university system is just a business you can look no further then the amount of student debt currently held by not only Americans but young people all around the world. University is a business, not a learning institution. What we believe about the world, the cosmos and ourselves is nothing more than lies and dogmatic beliefs that are no longer relevant or valid. We believe the lies of modern medicine and pharmaceuticals despite the constant stream of whistleblowers trying to scream at everyone not to believe them. We have an ideal about what we are as a species and where we have been as a civilisation that is wrong, flat out wrong. And yet it's how we live our lives and how we define ourselves as beings. It's so much bigger then just a few skewed research results, it's the ideals we base our whole lives and society around. If that well of knowledge has been poisoned then what is the ramifications for all of us if we continue to drink from it? 

I'm aware this isn't all of you (just a seeming majority), but can you please stop conflating evolution, evolution by natural selection, abiogenesis, and possibly the big bang theory under the umbrella term of "evolution"?If you really want a science conspiracy, maybe start with figuring out why a substantial portion of the population doesn't understand the difference between those terms; it's the biggest example of active disinformation in science in my opinion. It's easy to dismiss "evolution" when it's presented as, "basically everything is random and came out of an explosion and also god doesn't exist", but evolution is the simple fact that species change over time (observably, this isn't disputable unless you are an absolute moron). It isn't anything else. Natural selection is the concept that evolution can be directed by natural forces; if a change is detrimental to the reproduction of an organism, it tends to get passed on less than ones that are beneficial, thus over successive generations the beneficial traits tend to stick around while the detrimental ones tend to get weeded out. It isn't anything relating to abiogenesis, or the big bang, or even any specific claim about heritage. This is literally how we breed animals and plants, so it shouldn't be controversial either. If you want to dispute abiogenesis, or say that a specific claim about heritage is false, or even go for the absolute bullshit that is intelligent design (an idea that assumes the conclusion and sets out to find any way of supporting it that isn't immediately disprovable, only to fail literally every time), go right ahead, but please for the love of all that is good stop talking about the "myth of evolution"; each time you do, you are simply proving that humans are, in fact, dumb apes, and by virtue of failing to correctly use even the most basic terms of something you're making a claim to have insight on beyond that of the general population, you are ensuring that anyone with even a cursory understanding of the topic dismisses any and all claims you make immediately. 

I have something to add to this. Some of you may know me from my " what the hell happened in x " posts, which I will be updating soon enough.You may know that I do not find the Mainstream Scientific Community to be of much merit, while I do value their contributions to society. I especially find the Mainstream historical, biological and archaeological communities to be extraordinarily spiteful.I have gathered some examples of discoveries which could have overturned what are considered accepted facts, that were bitterly scorned, with their discoverers spurned by the global scientific elite. -In the early 1950s, [Thomas E. Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_E._Lee) of the National Museum of Canada found advanced stone tools in glacial deposits at [Sheguiandah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheguiandah), on Manitoulin Island in northern Lake Huron. Geologist [John Sanford of Wayne State University](http://www.geosociety.org/documents/gsa/memorials/v13/Sanford-JT.pdf) argued that the oldest Sheguiandah tools were [at least 65,000 years old and might be as much as 125,000 years old](https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/gpq/1986-v40-n3-gpq1924/032652ar.pdf). For those adhering to standard views on North American prehistory, such ages were unacceptable. Humans supposedly first entered North America from Siberia about 12,000 years ago. Thomas E. Lee [complained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_E._Lee#Career): "The site's discoverer [Lee] was hounded from his Civil Service position into prolonged unemployment; publication outlets were cut off; the evidence was misrepresented by several prominent authors . . .; the tons of artifacts vanished into storage bins of the National Museum of Canada; for refusing to fire the discoverer, the Director of the National Museum, who had proposed having a monograph on the site published, was himself fired and driven into exile; official positions of prestige and power were exercised in an effort to gain control over just six Sheguiandah specimens that had not gone under cover; and the site has been turned into a tourist resort. . . . Sheguiandah would have forced embarrassing admissions that the Brahmins did not know everything. It would have forced the rewriting of almost every book in the business. It had to be killed. It was killed.‚Äù -In 1880, [J. D. Whitney, the state geologist of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Whitney) published a lengthy review of advanced stone tools found in California gold mines. The implements, including spear points and stone mortars and pestles, were found deep in mine shafts, underneath thick, undisturbed layers of lava, in formations ranging from 9 million to over 55 million years old. W. H. Holmes of the Smithsonian Institution, one of the most vocal critics of California finds, [wrote: "Perhaps if Professor Whitney had fully appreciated the story of human evolution as it is understood today, he would have hesitated to announce the conclusions formulated [that humans existed in very ancient times in North America], notwithstanding the imposing array of testimony with which he was confronted." In other words, if the facts do not agree with the favored theory, then such facts, even an imposing array of them, must be discarded.](http://www.unmyst3.com/2011/06/neolithic-tools-from-california-gold.html)The sad thing is, Whitney was involved in his own cover ups, imploring that the Yosemite Valley had shrunk as opposed to being carved out by glaciers, and was posting redacted studied long afyer it was proven-Anton Mifsud, a noted archeologist who I have written about before, covers the Malta cover up, [including the deliberat destruction of wall carvings, wall paintings, skulls and fossils and acientific reports brilliantly here](https://grahamhancock.com/mifsuda2/)-Armand de Quatrefages, a member of the French Academy of Sciences and a professor at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, wrote in his book Hommes Fossiles et Hommes Sauvages (1884): "The objections made to the existence of humans in the Pliocene and Miocene periods seem to habitually be more related to theoretical considerations than to direct observation.‚Äù He wrote this in relation to the findings of another scientist, a J. Desnoyers at St.Prest, which had been dismissed despie ardent evidence.-Another recent example of challenging discoveries contradictive to the the views of the MSSC by dismissing them as false or fabrication, similar in fashion to that of the St. Prest discovery is the events surrounding the [bone fragments discovered by George Miller, curator of the [Imperial Valley College Museum in El Centro, California](https://www.anzaborregopaleo.org/cutmarks-on-bone.html). Miller, who died in 1989, reported that six mammoth bones excavated from the Anza-Borrego Desert bear scratches of the kind produced by stone tools. Uranium isotope dating carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey indicated that the bones are at least 300,000 years old, and paleo-magnetic dating and volcanic ash samples indicated an age of some 750,000 years. One established scholar said that Miller's claim is "as reasonable as the Loch Ness Monster or a living mammoth in Siberia," while Miller countered that "these people don't want to see man here because their careers would go down the drain.‚Äù -A good example of a controversial American early stone-tool industry reminiscent of the European eoliths is the one discovered by [George Carter in the 1950s at the Texas Street excavation in San Diego.](https://www.scahome.org/publications/proceedings/Proceedings.09Carter.pdf) At this site, Carter claimed to have found hearths and crude stone tools at levels corresponding to the last interglacial period, some 80,000-90,000 years ago. Critics scoffed at these claims, referring to Carter's alleged tools as products of nature, or "cartifacts," and Carter was later publicly defamed in a Harvard course on "Fantastic Archeology." However, Carter gave clear criteria for distinguishing between his tools and naturally broken rocks, and lithic experts such as [John Witthoft](https://www.scahome.org/publications/proceedings/Proceedings.09Carter.pdf) haD endorsed his claims. In 1973, Carter conducted more extensive excavations at Texas Street and invited numerous archeologists to come and view the site firsthand. Almost none responded. Carter stated: "San Diego State University adamantly refused to look at work in its own backyard." In 1960, an editor of Science, the journal of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science, asked Carter to submit an article about early humans in America. Carter did so, but when the editor sent the article out to two scholars for review, they rejected it. Upon being informed of this by the editor, Carter replied in a letter, dated February 2, 1960: "I must assume now that you had no idea of the intensity of feeling that reigns in the field. It is nearly hopeless to try to convey some idea of the status of the field of Early Man in America at the moment. But just for fun: I have a correspondent whose name I cannot use, for though he thinks that I am right, he could lose his job for saying so. I have another anonymous correspondent who as a graduate student found evidence that would tend to prove me right. He and his fellow student buried the evidence. They were certain that to bring it in would cost them their chance for their Ph.D.s. At a meeting, a young professional approached me to say, 'I hope you really pour it on them. I would say it if I dared, but it would cost me my job.' At another meeting, a young man sidled up to say, 'In dig x they found core tools like yours at the bottom but just didn't publish them.'" The inhibiting effect of negative propaganda on the evaluation of Carter's discoveries is described by archeologist Brian Reeves, who wrote with his coauthors in 1986: "Were actual artifacts uncovered at Texas Street, and is the site really Last Interglacial in age? . . . Because of the weight of critical 'evidence' presented by established archaeologists, the senior author [Reeves], like most other archaeologists, accepted the position of the skeptics uncritically, dismissing the sites and the objects as natural phenomena." But when he took the trouble to look at the evidence himself, Reeves changed his mind. He concluded that the objects were clearly tools of human manufacture and that the Texas Street site was as old as Carter had claimed.The point I wish to make here is how Carter was treated.Later dating proved him somewhat wrong and his critics somewhat right in that they were both off, its was older than what was accepted, but younger than what was claimed.

Prime example of Science being used as a tool for control: Medical Marijuana. Why hasn't the DEA re-scheduled? They still, to this day, have it classified as a Schedule 1 drug, which states that the drug has no medical use. 

Anyone also find it weird how people just say "Thats a scientific fact" to end a conversation.

we shouldn't forget that reddit is also contrived.everything we read everywhere, too.theres nothing like gathering your own evidence if you can

The problem that I have with science in the western world is that "science" is no longer about classification of knowledge and the activity of of breaking things down to understand them. Science has become the subjugation of truth and reality- and that is just... it really has taken a toll on people's minds I think, in the Western world.A lot of people equate science to truth. They think that science is about finding truth but it's not. You learn about the science *of* something.I think that science has pushed magics and things not easily explained or understood (including- but not limited to- concepts of a God, fixed or multiple realities, etc.) into something that seems "silly" or "archaic," and because of that I find myself shocked at the Western world and how everyone in it gets played like a fool and then wonders why.Those"elites" or "powerful people" or the "1%" or whoever else- **they believe in magic and practice it. They believe in the occult and they regularly practice it.** Why? You think because it's a fun activity? Because they're just "oh so evil" so they need to reflect images of that? No. Because the shit is real. And they're using magicks and occult practices on you people. Lemme just drop something here so you guys understand. "Magic"- from where I'm from- is seen as- the manipulation of reality, and people back in the day- back in our homeland- practiced witchcraft heavily. I have family who practiced witchcraft (Obeah). So when you start to manipulate reality- which we know is a construct of our minds (conscious and subconscious)- is when you start to perform magic.Telling a lie is the most normal thing here in the West, meanwhile- you would be exposed and branded elsewhere for something like that. You even have people out here talking about "white lies." And no one questions why? Nobody asks why there's "white lies" and "black/dark magic"? That they needed to differentiate to begin with??Imagine a world where people told the truth and lying was almost as bad as murder, imagine how straightfoward and honest people would be and how much trouble that would save you. Places like that exist. I've lived in places like that. My home country is like that.Science is great. But to me science is research- science is the constructions of a thing. You learn about the science of biology. The science of chemistry. The science of psychology. You don't learn the science of truth- because the truth is the truth- period. Let me end this with: "magic is magic until its science" is false. It's only through understanding the science of something that you can then perform magic.

If a scientific study is incorrect it should be able to proven so.

I would argue the biggest issue is the mis-connect of the public's perception of science and actual science. I find most pop-science articles to be crap, which often miss the point of the original paper or greatly expand the original conclusion beyond what the original paper was getting at. These funds often go to this considered "sexy" for the moment, so if you aren't doing "sexy" and "inpactful' research, good luck. This issue also comes from the public mis-understanding of science, since answering or exploring a question isn't seen as being important. To be a modern scientist, you need to be able to respond to the frequent questions of "what's the point?", "how will this impact my life?", among others. Another thing to consider is that big claims need lots of evidence to support the claim. A scientist will change their mind if you can show enough evidence to back your claim. One issue I have with claims of engines using water (for example), is that the builders of these engines usual are secretive about what happens in their engines, they ask for money first before showing the engine, and don't back up their claims with evidence. If you want be to believe you, show me things to support it. Otherwise, I don't care. You can say whatever you want, but if you don't back it up, I don't need to believe you. I don't think an individual will ever be blacklisted for these claims, but they won't be taken seriously if they continue to fail to support their claims.A third point to be aware of is that most science is done as a public service. Scientists PAY to publish and do peer reviews for FREE. Also, scientists are humans, so there are some biases and people with big egos in the mix. However, for the most part scientists will try to keep their biases and egos in check.And from my experience, the more I understand the world scientifically, the more in awe of it I become. I can look into an empty lot and be awed by the life growing and living there. I have seen that in death there is life. I have seen that for every question answered ten more arise. If you think we have discovered everything and no mysteries remain, your mind is already closed.

It's become fanatical, and has stifled progress.I think the only thing that's gonna make a difference is if a bunch of tenured researchers start open publishing everything.But then there's the heaven or hell, er I mean the publish or perish issue...

I'm always amazed by the level of anti-intellectual resistance and hysteria that my videos receive on YouTube, largely from people that share this perspective of science and automatically distrust and resent anyone who possess scientific knowledge and skill.  At this point I don't really care about educating them, I just enjoy owning them in debates and making them look like fools.  The hysteria over this month's double SDO eclipse (due to retrograde motion caused by SDO's orbit) and the resistance many had to its explanation has illuminated a great way forward for me.  I've set up a YouTube bot that will automatically predict all future SDO eclipses.  &#x200B;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJAoKCBmXcRY406OIBSo\_Jg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJAoKCBmXcRY406OIBSo_Jg)&#x200B;Now of course this bot does not get many subscribers or views, but that's fine with me.  When the next eclipse happens that causes the anti-intellectuals to start blaming Nibiru, Planet X, Hercolubus, or whatever else, I'll be there and ready with a video predicting it that has an upload date that pre-dates the event.  I will then enjoy the fights and argumentative beat downs that occur as we discuss how I'm a shill, paid by NASA, a secret government agent, a liar, etc.  And so the myth of "scientism" will continue and I will contribute to it.

 

Most of the "scientific" literature for which we base our medical decisions is bullshit. Favorable data gets published, unfavorable data does not.This presentation really opened my eyes to how the whole scientific literature system works. Everyone says "don't listen to one study, look at the whole. Look at meta- analyses." And while I still usually agree with that, there is a whole other part we need to look at.Industries flood the literature with an overwhelming number of studies, meta-analyses use the same data in a duplicate manner and don't realize it, using ghost writers is the norm even if they're from a pharmaceutical company, unfavorable data just doesn't make it to publication, etc.https://youtu.be/SZHyLODgUvs

>‚ÄúI want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you're being had.  Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.  There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period.‚Äù‚Äï **Michael Crichton** 

I prefer the term "scientism" and it is not only the corporate $ interests that hijack proper science it is the non-thinking cult followers that blindly salute anything published by left wing, PC approved scientists. Climate change, vaccines, medicine, evolution, psychology, etc. are examples of topics where the scientism adherents claim "the science is settled". 

We are in a metaphysical crisis. The previous sign regimes of the west, specifically Christianity embodied in the image of Christ, have been washed away and replaced with new symbols.  The emblem of the cross has been superseded by flashing electric images of advertisers and Hollywood showman.We are witnessing the dawning of a new religious order following the Nietzschean "death of god". The metaphysical crisis of our age was born well over one hundred years ago. We could place the pin at many events but these things happen in stages.The electric age as it evolved brought about both the death of god, and the dawning of a new faith. The scientist of today has much in common with the priest of the past. Similar vestments even. Religion always dawns out of who has the answers to critical questions about the movement of the stars. The first astrologers who could calculate a eclipse secured the power of that guild of star gazers for millennia. Today our scientists grapple with the same questions that priests and shamans grappled with. What is life? How is it formed? And how did the world come to be? When understood it this way the theories that attempt to define the world around us, specifically evolution and the big Bang Theory are nothing more than modern day creation myths. The flaws in the data of both theories are well known to the average scientist. In the big bang a failure to account for the possibility of a infinite universe leaves the realm of "empty space" beyond what our current telescopes can detect. Hense the recent claim of "multiple big bangs" to reconcile the time space differential. And to the theory of evolution betting on chance and lightning to form the first rna structures or preorganisms. To get around this they begin to use the claim that a meteor with some bacteria on it seeded life on earth. .It is easy to understand why science has become a "cult" when understood from a perspective of how the masses view people with critical information about the movement of the stars. Science didn't choose to become the new religion. The masses forced them into that role.

There is a question about the fundamental nature of reality that was glossed over early on and needs to be re-examined; is the basic substrata of the universe matter or thought? Physicalism or idealism? The scientific method can only ever address empirical questions. The (useful and necessary) requirements of observability and measurability, restrict the perview of scientific inquiry to physical phenomena. This does not mean that there only exists physical phenomena, simply that ideal or non physical phenomena are outside the realm of questions science can answer. I think now is a pertinent time to start asking this question again. From the rise of AI, Mandela effect and simulation theories to a potential awakening of consciousness through psychadelics, many fields of investigation are opening up the possibility that we've erroneously assumed a purely physical and mechanical universe, to the exclusion of any potential form of idealism. I am not saying that the universe is ideal. I am saying that when we deify 'Science' with a capital 'S' and pretend that the only answer to every question must be scientific, we shut off a space for questioning which is counter-productive in the open pursuit of knowledge in good faith. *edit*  original post was miles too long and rambling, the last two paragraphs were my end point. 

In science we believe everything has been proven. That is a huge misconception. They can't prove anything. The term theory means just that, a theory. Theory of evolution. Not provenTheory of gravity. Not proven Theory of relativity. Not provenCell theory. Not proven. They are at best a reasonable guess that explains a phenomenon. If we don't even know what molecules or cells are how can we say for sure that climate change is being cause by chemical reactions? Find one thing that science has proven. 

http://awakeningforums.com/thread/297/peer-reviewed-science-losing-credibilityScience today, in all fields, is plagued by corruption. Yet, more often than not, attempts to create awareness about scientific fraud ‚Äî an issue that few journalists have been willing to address ‚Äî are met with the response, ‚ÄúWell, is it peer-reviewed?‚ÄùAlthough good science should always be reviewed, using this label as a form of credibility can be dangerous, causing people to dismiss new information and research instantaneously if it doesn‚Äôt have it, particularly when that information counters long-held beliefs ingrained into human consciousness via mass marketing, education, and more.

Every religion needs an end of times scenario. Like heaven and hell or Armageddon. This fear generated creates a system where people are basically buying insurance for their soul. Science is absolutely the NWO religion. They even have Armageddon built in. What do they call that? Global warming or climate change. If you don't do what we say the world will end. Sounds like every other religion to me. 

No clue on the claims being made here, but got it from elsewhere and thought it would be interesting to add to the discussion and to hear what other people think.  Great debate how everything and anything can be corrupted and how it happens when its done.[Scientific Bullshit ‚Äì How ‚ÄòScience‚Äô is Used to Deceive the Public](https://www.wakingtimes.com/2018/09/20/scientific-bullsht-how-science-is-used-to-deceive-the-public/)September 20, 2018Previous discussions: [500+ Scientists Jointly Share Why They Reject Darwin‚Äôs Theory of Evolution](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/944h39/500_renowned_scientists_jointly_share_why_they/)James Corbett on this history: * https://www.corbettreport.com/episode-074-the-inbred-elites-million-year-plan/* https://www.corbettreport.com/episode-208-the-galton-institute-exposed/

Science should have thought us how reality works, but it has instead been used to simplify every aspect of reality to be written down and fit the scientific method, which was created within the Abrahamic simplification of reality.Psychedelics and research surrounding psychedelics has been thwarted because it is not possible to simplify the experience.If you cannot simplify the experience, then it is considered unscientific.The simplified science is "fat is bad, sugar is good because sugar industry can pay us money to say so and money to fund the next experiment is all we need".Real knowledge would be to understand something without the simplification of anything.

The bug makes it sound like the people who run reddit are trolling us. ‚ÄòYou know what would really freak them out?‚Äô*devious laughter*

Science is a cult for certain people 

Thanks for the response. I like your positivity, maybe you‚Äôre right and maybe if as many people as possible just live this way and spread information we can make somewhat of a difference.

After checking this all out, I did a lot of reading and all I have to say is "wow!"

When you can prove climate science is junk science with just two links, and people still call you crazy, you know immediately the Cult of $cience is real - and winning.Details on decades of weather modification. Climate is generally 30 years of weather- this is two to three climate cycles (varies by regions).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_seedingClimate science ignores all of this.https://youtu.be/V32iTBNoFuEClimate scientists, in their quest to understand climate change, literally ignore all the data regarding humans actually changing the climate.This is junk science. 

Want to see gatekeeping? HI GUYS, ITS THE MORGELLONS GUY. (no I do not give people morgellons, don't hurt me)https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8kegem/history_of_morgellons_disease_from_delusion_to/?st=jmrmcib2&sh=57ff7146This was removed for no real reason and I classified it under medicine or biology, I forget.**If your lazy, TL;DR:**Submission statement (I will be using the conclusion of the article): "Conclusion"The history of MD has taught us that scientific evidence must be carefully considered before a disease is written off as a purely psychiatric disorder. Delusional disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires clinical judgment, and all underlying causes for delusional symptoms need to be ruled out before jumping to erroneous conclusions. Medical practitioners continue to consider MD a delusional disorder, although studies have shown that MD is strongly associated with spirochetal infection. According to the best-available scientific evidence, MD should be considered a dermopathy associated with tick-borne disease. Further study of the genetics, pathogenesis, and treatment of MD is warranted."Morgellons disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi present within the epidermis, Borrelia burgdorferi, the same bacteria that causes Lyme disease, is the culprit. The presence of the borrelia spirochetes causes keratinocytes, fibroblasts and melanocytes to activate causing filaments of keratin and collagen with pigmentation occurring to form on a microscopic level.**BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER** I swear someone edited and changed my comment to sound grammatically and verbally incorrect, go read what I copied and pasted (and had to edit?) on the original thread, it reads like someone edited it to sound... idk?**Going on**Where did my hunt begin? 2016 at the start of the new year.Why did you hunt? Came across a youtube video of some jacknugget with hair taped to a lamp shade with the light on with the hair moving saying how the hairs are alive/etc, was kind of fucked up but I had remembered it back in the day being the "delusional/bug disorder", and from 2013-2016 my understanding of biochem, etc just got better (self taught, no certificates or degrees, I suck) at reading peer reviewed articles and determining garbage method/something, etc etc. Something about that video, at that time sparked a sudden desire to research it, and then I came across something sexy in my opinion, it turned me on sexually and mentally. THE ORIGINAL STUDY: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257881/2011 folks, its one of the sexiest peer reviewed studies I have ever layed eyes on, it legit gave me a hard one. "In BDD, keratinocytes have been shown to activate cytokine production and influence inflammatory markers.8 Morgellons patients also demonstrate inflammatory markers that indicate cytokine release.""In chronic BDD infection, there is evidence that spirochetes damage keratinocytes, resulting in the formation of unusual keratin fibers.15,16 Spirochetes have been shown to activate cytokines and other inflammatory markers.86 Keratinocytes influence inflammatory cell movement and retention in the epidermis via cytokine release.87,88 Tissue damage is aggravated by neutrophil infiltration, inflammatory mediators, and cytokines.15,16 Epidermal proliferation, hyperplasia, and influx of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes result in damage to keratinocytes and production of abnormal keratin filaments. The production of keratinolytic toxins by treponemes has been proposed8 and B. burgdorferi has been shown to stimulate inflammatory chemokine secretion."This got me thinking, if bovine digital dermatitis is caused by a spirochetal infection, and theoretically, based upon this peer reviewed article, is also the cause of Morgellons, wouldn't keratin like filaments and cytokine release in the skin cause itching/bug feeling? Wouldn't it feel like microscopic needles of keratin and collagen (Yes, fibroblasts are being activated) inbetween/inside cells/in your skin?This got me digging. Most of my end research comes here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/83kg0q/is_lyme_disease_the_new_aids_what_you_need_to_know/dviqurf/?st=jmrmwxwt&sh=0a08a7d7It was 100% manufactured unintentionally, for all those wanting to ask this question, I name the bacteria that causes it, it was released ACCIDENTALLY AND UNKNOWINGLY, and happened to be quite the little mutator/evolver. None of that matters now, AT ALL, what matters is stopping it, figuring out how to fuck its shit. First comment, is in regards to Morgellons, there are many more comments to come folks, c:**EDIT: Want to point out the reason I was pretending to get all sexual with this study, was because I forgot to mention that Lyme disease is considered a Spirochaetae, which means it can be sexually transmitted, theoretically, morgellons can be sexually transmitted as well as its causative agent is the same bacteria that causes Lyme disease. 

THE SECOND COMMENT IS HERE FOLKS, AND THIS ONE IS WAY FACKING DIFFERENT.ACROLEIN FOLKS, your probably thinking "What the fuck is this guy going on about, what is this chemical, google tells me its nothing important, its fuck all, why you talking about some random fucking chemical dude on reddit?"The reason I am talking about this chemical today is because glycerol is added to cigarettes, do you know what happens when glycerol dehydrates, and also when plant matter improperly combusts? It creates acrolein, acrolein hates humans, it fucking hates us, but its pretty damn silent about its hate, it does its damage in the long run. When you smoke a cigarette there is added glycerol, that added glycerol breaks down into acrolein, that acrolein then bonds with an adduct bond to your glutathione, which is the main antioxidant of the body, and is pretty helpful for preventing cellular aging. But it gets worse, acrolein, hates humans soo much, that when it comes contact with glutathione, it turns glutathione against humans, the adduct bond creates glutathionylpropionaldehyde, this also depletes the glutathione, I will give an example:Acrolein fucking hates humans, meets glutathione, it loves humans, but acrolein fucks glutathione and gets stuck in glutathione creating a whole new human hating fucking monster through DBZ fusion. Glutathionylpropionaldehyde.Before I go any further, I have to explain what Acrolein does exactly, want to find out? ""The biological effects of acrolein are a consequence of its reactivity towards biological nucleophiles such as guanine in DNA and cysteine, lysine, histidine, and arginine residues in critical regions of nuclear factors, proteases, and other proteins. Acrolein adduction disrupts the function of these biomacromolecules which may result in mutations, altered gene transcription, and modulation of apoptosis." Which is from [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mnfr.200700412).That leads to cancers, and organ failures, and likely some fucked up diseases, but this is just acrolein...Glutathionylpropionaldehyde.It fucking hates us even more. So Acrolein also has the ability to create ROS or free radicals, which are bad, and numerous, but what is really bad, is when acrolein FUCKS THE SHIT out of glutathione and once again DBZ fuses into the hate monster of hell. But then comes along Glutathionylpropionaldehyde.[So the following information is from this peer reviewed article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0891584993900583)""factthat glutathionylpropionaldehyde is a more potent stimulator of oxygen radical formation than acrolein indicates that glutathionylpropionaldehyde is a toxic metabolite of acrolein and may be responsible for some of the in vivo toxicity of acrolein.""Anyone know what an anti-oxidant is?, it donates electrons to free radicals, to you know, calm them the FUCK DOWN, like little fucking hyper Caillou's everywhere. Everyone fucking HATES THOSE CANCER CAUSING FUCKERS. Anyway, glutathione is an antioxidant, the most important antioxidant, not just your regular vitamin C, glutathione is that antioxidant king, its like, the Don of the antioxidants. This is also a true statement, but other antioxidants will actually work better in the presence of this antioxidant, its just that fucking good (Not really, most antioxidants are actually meant to be taken together, like think of a tomato, you got lycopene, vitamin C, and vitamin A, and thats all I can think of, those are all considered antioxidants, and eating 2 tomatoes will actually have more antioxidant effect vs avoiding antioxidants and taking a 400mg or whatever vitamin C chewable. Basically, smoking is very bad, the addition of glycerol in cigarettes accelerates the negative effects. The negative in-depth effects are caused by acrolein depleting glutathione in the body producing glutathionylpropionaldehyde and creating more ROS/free radicals (damaging hyper fuckers who want to be fed some electrons, think hyper over-active Caillous).

Third, this one is a little less sciency and a bit more theoretical and fun discussion.So this is just a random comment, I don't have many peer reviewed articles on these topics, but I am sure if you dug, you would find something. Some are also theoretical, and some have also been tested and had secondary issues preventing them being used sufficiently. I am going to talk about cancer cures. Now with the new immunotherapy they have out, there really is no excuse not to perfect cancer prevention and reverse cancer growth. But 2-3 years ago, this comment would have been all the rage.EMF generator. During mitosis, little spindles come forward to pull the parents duplicate chromosomes apart to pull one set of the duplicate pair to the daughter cell, so well, you know, replicate, and as long as they both get one full half of the chromosomes, they can repair the other side, and continue splitting/growing, like a tumor, or you know, like your butthole or something. Their is a polarity that occurs during this time, and using a generator that creates a small EMF field during growth stages (lets say they know how to "stimulate" or cause the tumor/cancer to "grow/etc"), which would cause the duplicate chromosomes to not split correctly, causing the daughter cell to go into apoptosis basically immediately, and following that, apoptosis occurs in the parent cell, leading to a reduction in the original size of a tumor. This has been used before on some Swedish Bicyclist or something. Monoclonal antibodies. As per google: "Monoclonal antibodies (mAb or moAb) are antibodies that are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Monoclonal antibodies can have monovalent affinity, in that they bind to the same epitope (the part of an antigen that is recognized by the antibody)."What this means is that it can directly target cancers with radioactive isotopes or with cancer medication. Now, this one is sketchy, but its called sodium dichloroacetate. It is known to cause mitochondria within tumors to awaken, the mitochondria immediately recognize the cell is compromised and they go into apoptosis (cell death), leading to a cell/a part of the cancer/tumor, being destroyed. Now, on my fourth comment, I will get into explaining how marijuana/THC has been proven to cure some forms of cancer, specifically glioma cells. Look out for the fourth comment folks. 

HEY KID, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM? HOW MANY FUCKWITS HAVE TRIED TO TELL YOU RANDOM SHIT? DO YOU REMEMBER THOSE MYLELIN SHEATH'S THAT COVER YOUR NERVES, PROTECTING THEM? REMEMEBER THOSE FUCKING PHOSPHOLIPID BILAYERS AND SHIT FROM HIGH SCHOOL? Well apparently their not just structural, we found out that there is basically a secondary fatty acid signalling system, and that is what the endocannabinoid system is, yuh. (As per google/wikipedia on endocannabinoid system: The endocannabinoid system is involved in regulating a variety of physiological and cognitive processes including fertility,[1] pregnancy,[2] during pre- and postnatal development,[3] appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory)http://www.jbc.org/content/271/32/19251.short"Altogether, these data strongly suggest for the first time that activation of the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway may play a pivotal role in the oxLDL-induced SMC proliferation and atherogenesis. "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15958274"Sustained ceramide accumulation in tumor cells mediates cannabinoid-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by in vitro and in vivo studies. This effect seems to be due to the impact of ceramide on key cell signalling systems such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade and the Akt pathway."https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12531545"This enzyme is regulated by several mechanisms, including the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated protein FAN (for factor associated with N-SMase activation) and oxidative stress. "https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0300_313"Œî9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, the main active component of marijuana, induces apoptosis of transformed neural cells in culture."" intratumoral administration of Œî9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212-2 induced a considerable regression of malignant gliomas in Wistar rats and in mice deficient in recombination activating gene 2. Cannabinoid treatment did not produce any substantial neurotoxic effect in the conditions used. ""Experiments with two subclones of C6 glioma cells in culture showed that cannabinoids signal apoptosis by a pathway involving cannabinoid receptors, sustained ceramide accumulation and Raf1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation."**TL;DR: THC or CBD oil intake increases ceramide levels, generated by hydrolysis of the membrane sphingophospholipid sphingomyelin (SM) through the action of a sphingomyelinase, and the increase ceramide levels control programmed cell death, and much more that we are still learning.**

This is my fifth comment and its in regards to the nature of the thread.In regards to this threads direction, science is not flawed, its that corporate interests sway outcomes, especially when a dozen researchers realize its either lie and get an extra 500k to live for a few years and add more research under your belt, or tell the truth, have the corporation back away from that research group, they lose funding, now people have to move, etc, some may have to go back to other countries if they can't find work in a reasonable time, etc. This is the sad state of society, not of science itself. I am a big theorist, I will sit here and tell you I believe we are all Yahweh, an enlightened/higher frequency being lowered his frequency to come and aide us, we corrupted them, and now I believe everyone is in limbo and no one has true power. I can also tell you there is no god and we are inside a black hole, the event horizon of a black hole holds all the information/data, it is always gathering, if specific data hasn't been received yet/something hasn't been sucked in yet that is not present within the event horizon, theoretically, that thing is impossible until it collects the necessary information, outside our black hole is another universe, with another event horizon, and you can imagine it infinitely, like a cell dividing, and gathering the necessary resources to mature or some shit. I can also theorize we are all electromagnetic beings who are being reincarnated repeatedly by frequency vampires who lack souls, but possess the ability to persist through another means beyond light, which theoretically, our souls are said to be comprised of. I can add to my first crazy theory and say reincarnation is a process of preservation, if the soul doesn't ascend, they are reincarnated and once again given the chance to do what they are supposed to do/their mission/whatever. When it comes to science though, its there, its just it requires thorough navigating and anyone who has their body in the room has to follow the rules or they are removed, me being an outsider peering in through multiple windows, one outside the room in the hallway, and one with a view in the room, basically, if it is their bread and butter, it is necessary to make sacrifices in order to survive in certain circumstances, either literally by putting food in your mouth or academically by submitting papers and continuing research to show off and try to get more research funds/etc. *I have no hate when I say this, its a true generalization*People are smarter, they can process things faster this day and age, but people lack understanding multiple concepts/sciences, so I can read through papers pertaining to diseases, biology, biochem, and I can verify if its a good paper(In my opinion, based upon method, setup, depth of study, if its been cited by a newer study, if it refers to good, older studies, etc), but you give me physics papers and I won't be able to tell you SHIT. Its not that people are dumb.The biggest problem that will be presented in this thread will be corporate interests, I dotted in other things that will likely be ignored, as well as my four other comments. EDIT: Problems that will be outlined in this thread: Corporate interests and its persisting effects, necessity staying relevant within academia, lack of understanding of multiple topics, or ignorance. 

Business interests have always compromised just about any innovation. Either in an attempt to maintain an older technology or to hold fast and monopolize another etc. That is unchanged for a long time as given example by Vespasian and Titus deciding to not accept a steam engine because it would upset the slave trade.the peer review system used for gatekeeping is a little harder to get to, but the absence of peer review is quite apparent and that can support gatekeeping for certain. There simply is not a lot of peer review that goes on because of the sheer amount of research being done.Incorrect premises are corrected all the time through the scientific method. Galileo was doing it too.I think there are a greater amount of people who simply cannot grasp the basics of a given science and so, in their ignorance they adopt a suspicious attitude. God forbid they should actually recognize their own ignorance and try to overcome it. Funny thing how ego works and the more ignorant a person is and combined with age, the less likely you are to explain much of anything. The ignorance is so deeply ingrained it becomes hopeless. There is a lot of this going on. As populations grow, there will be even more, because the heart of it seems to be that no matter the change, it stays the same as there are particular dictates of our own human nature that we cannot by that very same nature break free of.

The virtues of true science are conflated for the hyper-compartmentalized, infinitely specialized, and prohibitively costly endeavor currently called "Science" and then promoted and held high in society, schools, culture as the former.  The scientific method has fairly little to do with how the majority of people conceptualize and interpret "Science".

Lest we forget the revolving door of alphabet agencies deceiving the populous via this "science" which is harming people and society as a whole. It's such bs that people listen to, for example, the EPA regarding water privatization. Dafaq outta here. FCC and power companies with smart grid. Weaponized panopticon. CDC and vax, bill gates, wtf subjugation through vaccination. In fact, it's the scientists who are facilitating the fuckery. Causation. X is damaged because y.

Does this mean earth is flat?

Well damn.  Back to Christianity it is then.

This video does a nice job explaining a little bit how scientists have altered photos of places like Antarctica. It's more shocking how scientists at NASA have been editing photos of other planets for decades. All the planets in our system are hollow. The north and south poles have openings from which light emanates. However, the powers that be don't want you to know this. https://youtu.be/237F1_aLXZ8

The ‚ÄúTHEORY‚Äù that everything in the Universe will cease to exist is so stupendously inaccurate is highlights the ignorance that has befallen humanity!The Stars are not giant balls of gas, the Universe will not shrivel and wither into nothing, black holes are not single points of infinity that sit there doing nothing but leaking Hawking Radiation, withering into nothingness‚Ä¶Science, mainstream academic science is so fundamentally flawed it is literally stupefying!If you were to ask yourself, why is modern, ‚Äúpublic domain‚Äù science so inaccurate and flawed, the true answer would actually be way beyond your ability to fathom, accept or even contemplate, so I will not tell you ‚Äúwhy‚Äù science in mainstream academia is distortedWhat I will say, is that mainstream public domain science is being deliberately altered and aberrated for the purpose of suppressing knowledge and advancement in many fields, especially the fields of space travel.The ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù that ‚ÄúEnergy can neither be created or destroyed‚Äù is not true. In-fact, all the laws of physics are completely wrong - period!As an example, to say a body in motion will remain in motion until acted upon by an external force, this is wrong! I can not breakdown the dynamics of the Universe without literally writing a book, but I will tell you very simply that; If there is something preventing Matter/Energy from moving faster than the speed of light, then that ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is going to have an effect on all Matter/Energy in the Universe!To keep things simple, say you are in the Void - you are between the Galaxies. Okay, you are there with a bow and arrow - you pull back the string and shoot your arrow in the direction of the nearest Galaxy, it is 5 million light years away, and there is NOTHING between you and that Galaxy. - Will your Arrow continue moving at the same speed and direction towards the Galaxy? Mainstream science will say it will. even if it is on its journey for billions of years, it will continue on its path until acted upon by a force‚Ä¶ This is FALSIFIED! If there is ‚Äúsomething‚Äù that prevents matter or energy from moving faster than light, then that something will have an effect on all matter in the Universe and this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù will have an effect on the arrow. It will travel at the same speed for a very very very very very very long time, but eventually it will start to slow down. The Higgs Field (also known as the ‚ÄúDark Energy Field,‚Äù the very field that gives Matter its Mass will slow the arrow downEnergy cannot be created or destroyed is also inaccurate.I will keep it VERY simple and tell you that there are ways to use Time Manipulation and generate an excess of energy - NEW ENERGY can be created, and I will tell you that Black Holes are creating NEW ENERGY all the time.The Universe will not shrivel into nothingness. Stars are not giant balls of gas, Black Holes aren‚Äôt simply points of infinity sitting in space doing nothing but eating Galaxies! Black Holes, especially Supermassive Black Holes GROW Galaxies!Black Holes are actually Crystal Core Quantum Computers and they literally create Universes inside themselves and if the Universe inside the Black Hole is growing, the Black Hole can actually generate an excess of energy and spit that excess energy up and grow a Galaxy around itself!

I use to think this was crazy.  Recently I have become interested in Plato and his political theories.  I think these theories have formed the foundation for western political science. In one of Plato's books, called The Republic, he suggests that the reproduction of the cities population be controlled by the ruling elite.  Since the population would rebel against such control, Plato suggests using a lottery where two people would be chosen at "random" to have sex.  Of course the rulers would be making the choices.The city he is describing is not a republic.  The people think its a republic, but it is really an oligarchy.I think with the increase in communication, and the increased access to education, people are starting to see that **modern day republics are oligarchies also**.

The One Major Conspiracy above all others and which all roads eventually lead to is this: We are inside a Simulated Reality. It is a Holographic Matrix blocked off from the actual Real Free Universe. The Global Elite herd the masses for their brutally cruel and deranged Alien Masters: The Archons. Humanity is used as economic and ultimately as Energetic Slaves. The eventual goal of this Psychotic Cabal is transhumanism and the merger of computers/robotics with the human soul. These bodies have already been developed in the Deep Underground Bases. Upon insertion into these bodies the lack of free will is astounding. The Archons have chosen to remain here blocked off from The Source. Unfortunately they want their human prey to remain here enslaved forever...

Are these elites living a different life compared to us in terms of true potential? Do they have access to things that unlock their potential or are they just rich and living better with materialistic shit? 

I honestly think a lot of conspiracies can be explained with 'capitalism working as intended'.

Some have termed it the Satanic Global Control System 

as someone who works as a trader at arguably the most powerful bank, i can assure you that institutional investors/banks almost never hold a controlling stake in the companies you mentioned, and that their objective is simply to create value for shareholders and clients. our decisions are influenced entirely by numbers. it‚Äôs not like metlife is in fucking cahoots with bayers monsanto making sure enough people are getting sick so their other client pfizer can continue making profitable drugs. to thoroughly believe this is the case is ignorant and a complete disregard for how financial companies operateit‚Äôs true that there are inherent conflicts of interest in pharmaceutical companies, but there is nothing stopping a small competitor company from creating a cure to cancer (if one existed), for example, and releasing it to the public.sure powerful bankers exist, but they‚Äôre almost always in direct competition with one another and most of their time (at work and out of it) is allocated toward creating financial value for themselves and investors.

Dean Radin has this quote in his book "Real Magic"

According to Hyman "the overwhelming amount of data generated by the viewers is vague, general, and way off target. The few apparent hits are just what we would expect if nothing other than reasonable guessing and subjective validation are operating."

One of the best hedges quotes.

Evolution was never about explaining the origin of life, teachers and professors always teach students to refrain from using concrete words like "fact" and "proof" when describing scientific evidence, and the rest of that article was pretty much crap.

Skepticism of any institution is valid, and none are perfect. That said, just because science is flawed as you succinctly point out doesn't mean its all invalid or useless. 

My honest question to this is its great that we have all this knowledge, but we can we as individuals do about it? I would love to make a difference if possible but don‚Äôt even know where to start. I feel like being informed isn‚Äôt enough if I‚Äôm only one in a handful of people that knows the ‚Äútruth‚Äù whatever that may be. 

Goddamn exactly! And its pretty crazy as to HOW wrong we've gotten it... In terms of evolution, theres now strong evidence for directed panspermia causing the cambrian explosion (I can gladly point you to the source). So if you consider that, it would mean that theres been something watching for a while, what does that mean for evolution? What if you can tweak evolution by changing what viruses fall on earth?That's just the tip of the iceberg, the problem is these ideas used to be able to be considered by the community, now with blind faith anything that fundamentally challenges is met with a veracity and emotional response that causes productive discussion to be impossible. Many do it with good intentions, to prevent "wrong" thoughts to be accepted by the public. Problem is if you're unwilling to consider anything different you will forever be stuck with the understanding you have. This isnt only true of biology and evolution, but also physics, psychiatry, etc, many fields find themselves in a place where the leaders are so deeply entrenched in faith they become enraged and unable to listen, it's really rough trying to go beyond this response.

Well said.

PART 2-Danny Hilman Natawidjaja [was not able to carry out excavations of the suspected pyramid of Gunung Padang, because senior archaeologists from Indonesia were lobbying the government in Jakarta to prevent him from doing any further work on it](https://www.amazon.com/PLATO-NEVER-LIED-ATLANTIS-INDONESIA-ebook/dp/B00I3SIFRQ), on the grounds that they ‚Äú know‚Äù the site is less than three thousand years old and see no justification for disturbing it. After the presidential intervention in 2014, Danny was able to excavate, and in the expected time to reach the deeper layers, proved that a pyramid did indeed exist under the original site of Gunung padang, as well as buried structures and chamber. More importantly, very ancient dates for all of the above, The three chambers discovered are so rectilinear in form that they are most unlikely to be natural. The largest of these lies at a depth of between 21.3 and 27.4 meters (70 to 90 feet) and measures approximately 5.5 meters (18 feet) high, 13.7 meters (45 feet) long and 9.1 meters (30 feet) wide -In 1923, J Harlan Bretz proposed that the scablands, as well as the Grand coulee, Moses Coulee and the Quincy basin, were all formed as a result of one gigantic flood erupting from the melting of the ‚Äú spokane flood ‚Äú which was referred to as such due to the town of Spokane, and the iceberg was referred to as the ‚Äúspokane iceberg‚Äù, although it is today known as a part of the much larger Cordilleran ice sheets. The reaction of the geological establishment was one of stunned, embarrassed silence. To have strayed so far from the doctrine of uniformitarianism could only mean that Bretz must have gone mad. David Alt, Professor Emeritus of Geology at the University of Montana, describes one of the lectures that Bretz gave in which he expounded on the ideas in his 1923 paper: ‚Äú The geologists ‚Ä¶ were aghast in the same way that a roomful of physicists would be upon hearing a colleague explain how he had made a perpetual motion machine out of old popsicle sticks.‚Äù Alt describes an old professor of his own undergraduate days who had been a student sitting in the audience when Bretz read his 1923 paper. It seems the professor did a hilarious impersonation of Bretz ‚Äúpounding on the podium with both fists and stomping on the floor as he used vivid language and gestures to convey his idea of a catastrophic flood to his horrified audience.‚Äù Quite apart from the theatricals, the geologists were shocked to hear Bretz invoke: "a sudden catastrophe to explain the Scablands of eastern Washington. In their view, this was a reversion to the unscientific thinking of some 125 years before. To this day, most geologists consider it nothing less than heresy to invoke a catastrophic explanation for a geologic event. So Bretz stepped off the edge of a very long limb when he suggested that a great flood had eroded the Scablands ‚Ä¶ [It made] him a pariah among geologists, an outcast from the politer precincts of society". The outcast did not give up, however. On the contrary, he doggedly continued with his research, bringing down ever more controversy on his head in the process but believing that facts, ultimately, would vindicate him. The crunch came on January 12, 1927 when Bretz was ambushed by a lynch mob of his colleagues at a lecture he‚Äôd been invited to give to the Geological Society of Washington in the Cosmos Club, Washington DC. He believed that large parts of the ‚Äúspokane iceberg " must have melted with extraordinary rapidity, because ‚Äúthe volume of water was very great, almost incredibly great ‚Ä¶ In spite of high gradients to draw it off, the pre-existing valleys first entered were inadequate to carry it all, and the flood spread widely in a complicated group of anastomosing routes.-Bretz was not an exception. Alfred Wegener, who first proposed the notion of continental drift‚Äî plate tectonics‚Äîwas similarly pilloried, as, subsequently, were Luis and Walter Alvarez (the Chicxulub, ‚ÄúK-T‚Äù impact), Steven J. Gould (punctuated equilibrium), Victor Clube and Bill Napier (coherent catastrophism), and James Lovelock, Sherwood Rowland, Mario Molina and Lynn Margulis for their contributions to geophysiology and the Gaia theory. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that Richard Firestone, Allen West, James Kennett and others who have followed the evidence and stuck their necks out to suggest that a comet impact caused the Younger Dryas haD also come under sustained and bitter attack.

Private prisons and cops lobby hard against it. Their numbers would plummet if they couldn't put people in prison on marijuana charges. They run the circus and the rest of us just dance.

The DEA is pretty far from a scientific body.

Science says...Science shows us...Science allows us to...It's almost like they've picked some new, disembodied deity to attach their philosophies to.

Do you have good links to share about the science/occult ties ? I'm really interested by this matter 

Yes.  But if all of the scientific study and evaluation for Product A comes from the manufacturer and the federal agency that's supposed to regulate it--and those agency's directors are previous board members of said manufacturer....Who is going to fund and investigate the claims?

One thing that I've bumped into is that there are things that many Scientists as they're currently taught are simply unable to consider. If certain fundamental "truths" are questioned the mode of thinking instantly switches to emotional and irrationally skeptical, at that point many scientists will use a skill many have, being able to cherry pick something small to validate what you believe and wash away the rest.One example I've been using to bring this out is a spinning bicycle wheel on a pole, when you spin it up and move it around it feels heavier right? Could this same effect explain isotopes in the way of electrons spinning up instead of adding neutrons? How come E=mc^2 doesn't have a velocity term? Many many quantum physicists literally become enraged, as if your insulting a religion than trying to figure out what's going on... it's insane.Unfortunately I think this guttural reaction has been leveraged to prevent any huge fundamental leaps in progress, limiting all progress to incremental small steps

If someone could post some examples of toxic incentives derailing worthwhile findings, it would really drive this point home.

So this will be a discussion where we can simply make grand and sweeping allegations without providing any evidence at all?

I think its important to make a distinction between the current embodiment of Science and it's institutions and scientists working within much of it.I think vast majority of the scientists working in this system actually really really want to do good, they want to make real progress happen. But the incentives are toxic, and those who fulfill them rise up in the chain while those who stick up for their morals are reprimanded as such.The human will is there, its a matter of bringing it out. We currently don't understand how powerful we are, but that the time for that to change is coming. Not in any like woo woo we can learn to fly with our brains sort of thing, but in the way that once we understand the underlying structure of our universe the power to imagine and bring thought to reality takes a whole new meaning.Computers can't imagine, and our system does not incentivize imagination in any way shape or form, part of the toxic system that currently is in place. But people want to imagine, we just need to bring it out.

> Almost each and every peer reviewed study in the community has edited data to conform to a predetermined hypothesis to keep the funding rolling in.Can you explain what you mean by this? Peer review is specifically important so different programs under different funding can confirm or debunk a study. Peer study is exactly the process used to eliminate "edited data to conform to a predetermined hypothesis." 

You nailed it. I am heavy into anthropology/archaeology and the like... anyone who steps out of line in this field and reports findings that don't fit a narrow view has their "careers" ruined in an instant and are mocked... even if they are coming from a completely "scientific" place with hard facts and well thought out theories. In the long run so many of these forward thinkers have been proven right. It's the same in any field that relies on funding from corporations, universities, etc... all highly political atmospheres where truth doesn't really matter. The status quo does because it's obviously working damn well for them.So yeah... never underestimate what a person will do when their meal ticket or fragile ego is at stake.

Spot on. The best budding scientist in the country won't succeed if they can't write a good grant application.  A negative result used to be a GOOD thing. The science of the next golden age will be open source. 

When you are aware of things like this, it makes trying to live within the world almost unbearable. It's like the whole world is rigged to only benefit a select few, and we all just get fucked.People sure can be evil all in the name of money and power.

Can you answer my question?

I think the point of science is to explain the world we observe in the using the fewest number of rules. Many people, especially those currently in power, have forgone that driving goal for the prioritization of order over progress. There's no reason to upset the status quo if it continues to maintain order. It's appealing and easy, but often times the simple path is the hard path.But I do say, there are a LOT of very smart, especially young, scientists who want to work outside the bounds of the current rotted system. The question is how do you empower those people? 

Lol whose down voting me?

You start out with very insightful knowledge:>In science we believe everything has been proven. That is a huge misconception. They can't prove anything.But you're incorrect to expect anything more than this. Turns out, the only things you can "prove" in the technical sense are to be found in "closed, logical systems" like math and formal logic. Those systems deal with deductive logic: if truth goes into valid arguments, you can guarantee truth as a product.Science, forensics, fraud investigations, applied maths, all the other forms of "figuring things out" or "verifying theories" that exist deal in *inductive* logic.Inductive logic cannot guarantee the truth of the product **even if the inputs are true.** That's why science can't "prove" anything, however, it can *demonstrate* theories. And it's the system of figuring things out that we depend upon the most.For example, if you mix vinegar and baking soda 10,000 times, and each time it does the same thing, you still cannot guarantee the reaction on the 10,001st time. But science can answer one question with certainty: is this theory false? The answers come in 3 varieties: * 1. Yes* 2. Not yet* 3. The theory is meaninglessThat's all we can get from science.To sum up, most people don't understand a goddamned thing about science or evidence, yet they're ready to take a shit on all the products of scientific investigation regardless of methods employed to reach various conclusions. In order to tell if results are being manipulated, one must actually read the study and look for ways for the data to get flubbed. I'd bet my testicles not a single "science denier" has the patience or wherewithall to do that. 

Or measles and a new plague but hey- all vaccines are created equal, are perfect the moment somebody even conceptualizes it and its ready to go to every baby in the world.  Im not saying don't vaccinate, im saying there is clear fear mogering ti anyone who chooses anything less than **blindly accepting all vaccines**, like if you choose to delay, space out, or swap mmr for singles, all of these are viavblr and the CDC says the only reason they pump so many at once is to ensure everyone is fullyis vaccinated.  If you dont get the flu ahot you're a baby killing monster and you will be witch hunted by the ~~cult~~ science fanboys even if you have all other vaccines.

I disagree that science requires simplification.  What it requires, to fit the existing paradigm of the scientific method, is specificity.  Popular understanding of science ultimately results in over-simplification and subsequent misunderstanding, but science itself does not.

I think that science tries to explain the observable with the fewest numbers of rules, the "simplest" way. But this doesn't preclude the idea of consciousness and metaphysics etc, it just means we don't really understand it yet from its simplest principles. The issue in science's inability to interpret consciousness from the bottom up comes from a few places i think, including our misinterpretation on the shape of planck's unit and our rudimentary understanding of how the brain processes information. We still don't really understand how overlapping EMF waves, brain waves, produce a conscient being, much less a deeply spiritual one. If one begins to consider consciousness as spinning overlapping EMF waves performing quantum computation using geometry, our definition of "where" they could live might change as well, could spinning EMF waves live in the ionospheres of planets? Could the Schumann resonances fulfill this role?

Exactly if it's not empirical it's not science. That's the reason the big bang and evolution are closer to myth than true science

especially so when certain "popularizers" like neil degrasse tyson and his ilk decide to speak ex cathedra on matters they simply cannot have any information about. i like science, but science cannot say anything about what might be beyond death or operating outside the confines of our perceptible universe. i understand that believing in other things is not scientific, i wish the scientists would stick to what they know and can prove.the "cult" of science is especially noticeable when one is confronted by someone educated by these popularizers. i was recently told about how information flows along the surface of a blackhole or something by a guy who read something by stephen hawking. 

I think theres one cancer cure that none is considering because it's too crazy... essentially I believe that Eukaryotic cells also have their own CRISPR. What if you could reprogram the system that determines self vs non self, reprogramming innate immunity of individual cells, could you then decide to turn on any transcriptional program in a local manner?

The hyper compartmentilisation combined with specialization as a response to increasingly complicated theories is both a coping mechanism (cant learn everything) but also gives a convenient scapegoat when you're given something that doesn't jibe with your scientific world view. You can simply say, that's out of my field of expertise.

Plato was a bad person and philosopher. You are correct. There's been a push and pull away and toward his type of philosophy for millennia.

That is stupid wishful thinking.Granted, it is entirely possible we are in a simulation, *but* that means we are also *part* of the simulation... a successful attempt at developing emergent artificial intelligence.But that isn‚Äôt any different than religion is it?  The exact same ancient thought with modernized names for things.  Still means that *a creator* made us and our world for a purpose; what is the real difference between ‚ÄúGod created the world in his image‚Äù and ‚Äúa programmer created a simulated reality to generate true artificial intelligence that passed the Turing test‚Äù?The reason *your take* on it is stupid is because rather than accept that our world being a simulation means nothing of consequence, you craft some Hollywood cliche of an idea that we are ‚Äúreal‚Äù but our world is not which implies that we could escape it.  That is just a false hope of and childish thinking; like supposing you could break open a computer and remove a video game character from *its* simulated reality.Edit:  of course, this is probably wasted, Scientologist are too brainwashed to drop your grand archon space opera nonsense... without Star Trek and the matrix, you lot wouldn‚Äôt even have a religion.

See- what is unlocking your potential? Because you can do that today, right now.&#x200B;That's what a lot of people don't like to admit in this sub. The powerful people, I'm not even gonna start on them- but you see how they put their hand in their coats- that's a signal that they're hiding information. That's their goal. To hide information from the masses in order to keep the system- and those in it- in check. You can perform magic spells on both yourself and others and construct your own reality- but you need to first do it in the mind- "as above so below".&#x200B;Everything you see is constructed around the system, and when you start to think about succeeding outside the system and unlocking your potential *outside the system* \- you've already taken a step towards that.&#x200B;The rich and the elite cast spells on our consciousness every day. Through music, media, advertising- its an attack and a tax on our subconscious... in order to make up the group think- to keep that system going, if you follow.&#x200B;Be aware of magic- understand the *true* definition of magic. It's one thing to know who's doing what- but if we deny the power they have which is not just material- but *spiritual* as well- we've already lost. You don't bring a knife to a gun fight. Anyway...

the simple difference between the movers and shakers and the general mass of people is quite simple.the busy people are busy, they don't pontificate for a year about a subject, they just do. legal or illegal. they don't care so long as profit and not being caught or spotlighted.they succeed or they fail, then they try again. they may be stopped by a competito or cops, legally or otherwise.we still argue about 9/11, that was over and done with sixteen years ago. they moved onto the GWOT, then they moved onto Shock Doctrine and extracting profit from Iraq and elsewhere.we are still arguing about thermite and dancing Israelis. this is why Noam Chomsky says 9/11 doesn't matter (after the fact), its ancient criminal history, it was treason , they got away with it, they 100% own the legal system..

You work for the Bank for International Settlements? Or the International Monetary Fund? The Bank of England? The Federal Reserve? If it's not one of those then no one is arguing you work for the most powerful banks. 

Short answer: black magic. 

 

I mean I think the real answer is simply that we don't know.  If you believe the history we learned in elementary through high school to be true, then it points to the Napoleonic wars as when the Rothschild family seized control of world central banks.  But that's kind of the point.  What we're taught in 'history class' may be completely false.  How would anyone know?  I mean if someone came up to you tomorrow and said everything you've ever known about world history is false, how could you prove them wrong?  It's fascinating to think about.

They located a downed plane via remote viewing.For some reason, I don't think throwing darts at a map is going to work quite the same way.It's like "priming", where instead of "I think I can...", you use terms like, "I know I can...", you're basically setting yourself up to succeed, rather than just *thinking* you can succeed.It's hard to put a data value on humans, our conciousness and what we're capable of, especially when we don't really know how the human mind works.

Studies say that? Holy shit! Inject me with everything they have, please! 

fuck the bots

Michael Moore just had a segment in his documentary where their was public pressure put on officials to falsify the results of lead tests in Flint, MI children.  The girl who was supposed to fudge the numbers actually resigned over the ordeal.  Good segment of a good and worthwhile movie in my opinion.

Thanks very much for your post and the links.

But I thought chocolate both cured and caused my cancer

I think a lot of this derives from the way these studies are funded. A lot of the funding for academic or scientific studies comes from private industry, governments or special interests.

Depends on what your motivation was for getting the degree.  Maybe you already knew this and wanting to change it.  Maybe the money and prestige will be enough.  Maybe you don't believe it at all.  What are you imagining?

Of course you're gonna find creationists on this shitty conspiracy subreddit lol

Part of the problem is a disconnect between the realities of science and how it is practiced and regular people who consume information. Scientists deal with evidence but the laity deal with interpretations. Over time those interpretations become cemented as facts with help from educators and the media. 

The process is what matters and each person needs to apply the processes and methods to their own decoding of reality. But the results that were told about all need to be taken with serious grains of salt. And that comes from both mainstream science and alternative models. And most importantly, ask yourself Cui Bono? We have to look past what's being said and see the intent of the heart of the person saying it. Only then will we have the right frame of reference with which to view their statements. 

Certain branches most assuredly are nearly all invalid or useless. The first leaked climategate emails should have ended a dozen careers, instead the institutions doubled down and the entire system is still just as corrupt as ever.

Honestly man I'm not sure. The best solution I have come up with is to be the change you want to see in the world. One person isn't going to be able to drastically change anything, but as an individual we can contribute to greater change. I almost feel like having to think we personally must be the ones to stop things is just another ego trap. In terms of what we can do about this issue, just talk about it with people. If you talk about these issues, talk about how what we think of science has become something else it contributes to the greater collective conversation between everyone. The more people that talk about it, the more the issue is brought into the spotlight, the more we can begin to work on rectifying what has happened to science as a discipline. 

Could you point to the source for Panspermia etc... &#x200B;

What does veracity mean? "That's just the tip of the iceberg, the problem is these ideas used to be able to be considered by the community, now with blind faith anything that fundamentally challenges is met with a veracity and emotional response that causes productive discussion to be impossible."

PART 3-Early in his career, Louis Leakey, who later became famous for his discoveries at [Olduvai Gorge in Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olduvai_Gorge),  began to have radical ideas about the antiquity of humans in America. At that time, scientists thought the entry date for the Siberian hunters was no greater than 5,000 years ago. [Leakey recalled](https://plus.google.com/+ChrisReeveOnlineScientificDiscourseIsBroken/posts/JtRaDex3d5V) "Back in 1929-1930 when I was teaching students at the University of Cambridge . . . I began to tell my students that man must have been in the New World at least 15,000 years. I shall never forget when Ales Hrdlicka, that great man from the Smithsonian Institution, happened to be at Cambridge, and he was told by my professor (I was only a student supervisor) that Dr. Leakey was telling students that man must have been in America 15,000 or more years ago. He burst into my rooms‚Äîhe didn't even wait to shake hands." Hrdlicka said, "Leakey, what's this I hear? Are you preaching heresy?" "No, Sir!" said Leakey. Hrdlicka replied, "You are! You are telling students that man was in America 15,000 years ago. What evidence have you?" Leakey answered, "No positive evidence. Purely circumstantial evidence. But wa ith a man from Alaska to Cape Horn, with many different languages and at least two civilizations, it is not possible that he was present only the few thousands of years that you at present allow." Leakey continued to harbor unorthodox views on this matter, and in 1964 he made an effort to collect some definite evidence at the Calico site in the Mojave Desert of California. This site is situated near the shore of now-vanished Pleistocene Lake Manix. Over a period of eighteen years of excavation under the direction of Ruth D. Simpson, 11,400 eolith-like artifacts were recovered from a number of levels. The oldest artifactbearing level has been given an age of 200,000 years by the uranium series method. However, as happened with Texas Street, mainstream archeologists rejected the artifacts discovered at Calico as products of nature, and the Calico site is passed over in silence in popular accounts of archeology. Leakey's biographer Sonia Cole said, "For many colleagues who felt admiration and affection for Louis and his family, the Calico years were an embarrassment and a sadness." Yet the artifacts of Calico also have their defenders, who give elaborate arguments showing that they were human artifacts, not geofacts resulting from natural processes. Phillip Tobias, the well-known associate of Raymond Dart, discoverer of Australopithecus, declared in 1979: "When Dr. Leakey first showed me a small collection of pieces from Calico . . . I was at once convinced that some, though not all, of the small samples showed unequivocal signs of human authorship." Ruth D. Simpson stated in 1986: "It would be difficult for nature to produce many specimens resembling man-made unifacial tools, with completely unidirectional edge retouch done in a uniform, directed manner. The Calico site has yielded many completely unifacial stone tools with uniform edge retouch. These include end scrapers, side scrapers, and gravers." Flake tools with unifacial, unidirectional chipping, like those found at Calico, are typical of the European eoliths. Examples are also found among the Oldowan industries of East Africa. Among the best tools that turned up at Calico was an excellent beaked graver. Bola stones have also been reported. In general, however, the Calico discoveries have met with silence, ridicule, and opposition in the ranks of mainstream paleoanthropology. Ruth Simpson nevertheless stated: "The database for very early man in the New World is growing rapidly, and can no longer simply be ignored, because it does not fit current models of prehistory in the New World. . . . there is a need for flexibility in thinking to assure unbiased peer reviews.‚Äù Support for the authenticity of the Calico tools has come from a find in Brazil. In 1982, Maria Beltrao found a series of caves with wall paintings in the state of Bahia. In 1985, a trench was cut in the Toca da Esperansa (Cave of Hope), and excavations in 1986 and 1987 yielded crude stone tools associated with Pleistocene mammals. When the bones were tested by the uranium series method, ages in excess of 200,000 years were obtained. The maximum age was 295,000 years. The discovery was reported to the scientific world by Henry de Lumley, a famous French archeologist. The tools were fashioned from quartz pebbles and were somewhat like those from Olduvai Gorge. The nearest source of quartz pebbles is about 10 kilometers from the cave site. De Lumley and his coworkers said in their report: "The evidence seems to indicate that Early Man entered into the American continent much before previously thought." They went on to say: "In light of the discoveries at the Toca da Esperansa, it is much easier to interpret the lithic industry of the Calico site, in the Mojave Desert, near Yermo, San Bernardino County, California, which is dated at between 150,000 and 200,000 years." According to de Lumley and his associates, humans and human ancestors entered the Americas from northern Asia several times during the Pleistocene. The early migrants, who manufactured the tools in the Brazilian cave, were, they said, Homo erectus. While this view is in harmony with the consensus on human evolution, there is no reason why the tools in the Toca da Esperansa could not have been made by anatomically-modern humans. As we have several times mentioned, such tools are still being manufactured by humans in various parts of the world.

The talk was taken out of circulation, placed in a corner and given a warning label. 

That was just the title of the Youtube video.

We won that one.(blows smoke off the barrel of his Colt .45)

Scientific bodies are pretty far from science so that isn't saying much.

Well there are a lot of independent sources and have so far reaffirmed most studies.For instance even though sugar is often promoted by coco-cola supported studies , the counter studies proved coco-cola wrong.&#x200B;

They become enraged because it‚Äôs nonsense. First off, in e = mc^2, c is the velocity term. Second, the way an electron ‚Äúspins‚Äù is fundamentally different from a bicycle wheel, they just chose to use the same word. Third, science is all about building models of the world. When your model makes a prediction that matches measurement, you roll with that model until you observe something that doesn‚Äôt match. If you want to replace neutrons with an ‚Äúup‚Äù spin, go ahead, but then you have to consider what new predictions that model would make. If you treat it mathematically the same, then it doesn‚Äôt matter which model you use, nothing changes. If on the other hand your ‚Äúup‚Äù spin model changes predictions about how particles behave, then you have to check which of the two models match observation better. The current model which includes neutrons matches observations incredibly well, so there‚Äôs no need to change it. 

>  How come E=mc2 doesn't have a velocity term?That equation is only valid at rest. The full equation from relativity is E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 , where p is the momentum which is related to velocity. When the velocity is zero so is the momentum, and so it reduces to E=mc^2 . I don't think any physicists would be enraged by that question but you could also look up the answer yourself.

I think you have a point here. Scientists work very hard and sacrifice being able to live truly free so they can complete their experiments. When someone suggests their entire effort is based on false premises, it causes cognitive dissonance. An easy way to get around the dissonance is to cherry pick an easy argument.A good example is people who work with GMO crops. They will laugh in the lab at how ‚Äústupid‚Äù people are for being afraid of GMO crops, citing that transgenic foods have been proven safe to consume. This is cherry picking and missing the entire point. The point that their work with GMO crops is 95% going to propping up a massively unsustainable food system consisting of monocultures and agrigiants.. 

Oh quite the contrary; in the process of debunking this nonsense I learn a huge deal.  I become better at science by it, and I always follow the evidence no matter how unpopular it makes me.  Yes, the end result is a massive intellectual beatdown of the ignorant idiots who chide me for being a scientist.  I doubt they learn anything in the end, but that's not my problem.

 

Any large time consuming discovery is put on the back burner for what's instant. That over time leads to a cycle, you start subconsciously prioritizing "safe" ideas.Its hard to give an idea of what might have been, but I think the general state of the field, with huge amounts of complexity and productivity but little creativity points to this type of thinking having been happening for a while

It's money over progress

*raises hand*

People are told how to think in Abrahamic societies. Popular science and overt simplifications of reality for profit is why life in the west is so strange and riddled with problems ranging from poor nutrition to pollution 

 

If we try to make sense of a simplification of reality, the results will be contorted to fit that reality. 

You really think so? You believe that millions of scientists and artist and all of NASA and the world are in some huge secret to release the truth to us? I‚Äôm curious. I work as an intel analyst and work with sat√©lites, space etc.. in curious in your opinion. all respect of course

>Plato was a bad person?????

Cast some Spells. Sounds legit.

The simple difference between the wise and the naive is quite simple too: there is no "they" or "we" there is only "us" and "ourselves". We are all One and we are all responsible. 

Exactly. Anyone who doubts the global banking elite are up to nefarious shit needs to watch the interview with Dutch banker Ronald Bernard. 

really? because sales and trading is the only division that faces institutional investors... who the fuck do you think does all of this supposed plotting? has anyone ever in history been as intelligent as they must for this supposed conspiracy to be possible? have inter company relations ever been conducive to this supposed behavior? has a (proven...)conspiracy ever been half as large and as quiet as this? the answer to all of these questions is...no. a simple understand of the financial industry renders most of the claims in your initial post...well...unfounded.

sure... controlling interest refers to ownership of a business >50%. creating value refers to financial value (ie earning a return for the bank and providing liquidity to the market)

at least for the fed, id argue that private sector banks have more autonomy, greater scope, and have a greater ability to ‚Äúcontrol the public‚Äù if they so chose. 

Perhaps the heart is just a heart. If I show you a head you might know it as Bob or George, but a heart is just an anonymous muscle. It's more of a force than a personality. Maybe you could call it evil. Just a thought.

The top of the pyramid. 

And this this is great. And people that say we live in a society to discredit this don‚Äôt realize the actual points

>Maybe the money and prestige will be enoughIf you want to pursue one of the hardest degrees available for money and prestige, you wont finish it. And I say this with personal experience, having talked to med students and myself pursuing it.

*crickets*

Biologist here. Most likely he's full of shit.

As in perceiving themselves to be fighting for truth. It's interesting I think, because the same sort of thing I've seen pop up with people who are defending really strong religious truths. I feel like it often comes from a good place, but it can cause you to be too focused and miss stuff.

It‚Äôs a serious question. How do we combine human resources to understand the universe and physical world better? Have everyone reproduce/verify all knowledge for themselves? What a joke and a cop out. Who do YOU trust. At some point your ‚ÄúI do my own research‚Äù answer breaks down into the BS that it is.

>placed in a corner and given a warning label.What does this even mean?

Okay, so I looked into it on my own, and it appears the talk is not listed on TED.com.That would have been such an easier answer.

Easy Batman joke setup but I like this angle even more 

Go an ask almost anyone studying a particular field how many journal articles they read but also try to replicate. 

for how long were coco-cola supported studies considered to be truth before first independent study proved them wrong.

This is a Hasty Generalization.  You have not studied or provided enough examples for such a conclusion.

Exactly, the reason why its a special case is because it considers all of the mass of a particle as a 2D wave, this is only true of 2D things, waves, bosons, photons, 3D matter on the other hand behaves differently, with the analogy of a spinning bicycle wheel becoming relevant. Currently there is no distinction between mass (2D) and matter (3D) which leads to a lot of confusion by interpreting bosons/photons as particles.It coincidentally turns out that electrons kinda are bicycle wheels spinning w/ in the proton/neutron nuclei, most of their "mass" stored in their momentum which is also their negative charge. We perceive the electron's presence in the manner akin to throwing charged tennis ball particles and observing where they land, because of that we see them as clouds. Because vast majority of their energy is "stored" in their clouds treating them as 2D waves in our equations actually proves extremely accurate, but its an equilibrium simplification, in reality these are moving, interacting, objects.

That's the current explanation yes, the assumption that the velocity of light does not change, w/ c being a constant. The E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4  comes from our misenterpretation of the shape of planck's constant (equilateral triangle vs square triangle), because this is how we currently interpret "square" numbers.

Care to explain why?

Interesting, i'll give these some reading. I'm aware of the work by Marcello Barbieri, personally there are clearly a few codes w/ in biology which show intelligent order, thereby being able to create far more complexity than the sum of their parts. A key concept i've bumped into consistently is that of the generation of controlled complexity through the use of hierarchically organized combinations of building blocks. A few obvious analogies are the transcription factor system that controls our DNA-->RNA, signalling cascades involving GPCRs, immune signaling w/ TLRs, etc.There definitely is an intelligent signal [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103513000791) and its interpretation imo makes directed panspermia something to consider.. 

Implying what? All good answers are unnecessarily complex?I don't quite follow.

Thats like saying you believe millions of soldiers are in on the conspiracy to steal oil from Iraq after 9/11? all respect of course

 

Plato believed in castes, that means he believed that some people were better than others just by the social status into which they were born. I mean " he suggests that the reproduction of the cities population be controlled by the ruling elite" isnt enough to see what a douche he was? And he had socrates to teach him but still....

It is metaphorical for a process that is no less insidious, seductive, or captivating than if magic were real and it were indeed a spell.You can get hung up on the nouns, or you can recognize the truth of what is being spoken.Are there lizard people in human skins making the rules? No. But functionally, there are people who are operating on the reptilian brain who are constructing society in such a way that it may as well be true.It is a metaphor.

Are you a teenager? Do you want to know an easy way to "cast a spell" to generate money without having to get a job?I will tell you the process (or I could even say- the science) of this spell.First, think about wanting the money to materialize. Imagine the money materializing between your fingertips. What you would spend the money on if you had it. Just think about the money. If you do not do this first step, the money will never materialize.Now that you've found your vibration- we're going to cast a spell by creating an illusion in order to materialize the money.Our illusion will not be grand, it won't take a lot (if any) of physical work, you won't have to make a blood sacrifice- all you have to do is think of a reason you should get this money. Whether it be a road trip, school trip, party, present for a friend or otherwise- let the reason be anything but the truth (which is that you just want to get your hands on some money; and I will tell you why later).Now that you have a reason, fortify it with an emotion. If you don't go on this road trip- will you be sad and disappointed that your friends are going on a life-changing journey without you? Will you be angry if you don't receive the money because it might impact your academic progress (school trip)?Once you're done those three steps- once you've aligned with a vibration (money), you've laid the groundwork for the illusion (the lie) and you've charged it with an energy (emotion), now it is time to cast the spell.All three points must be in a balance of power. The greater amount of money you seek, the greater the groundwork for the illusion must be, and the greater the energy associated with the spell must be.Go to your parents and ask them for money, give your reason, and then utilize your body (eyes, voice, behavior) to display emotion to charge your reason. Remember, everything must be in balance; You cannot make a fuss over five dollars, as you cannot ask for five-thousand haphazardly. Once you've finished asking them- leave all the extra work to the Universe.If your spell worked, your parents should be back with some money. If your spell failed, you should reexamine your spell, or find ways to fortify your illusion in order to materialize the money.To sum this up- through the lie (deceit through symbols spoken), you have created an illusion in the material world (the world of senses), and have began to manipulate reality through vibrations.The breakdown of the casting of the spell to materialization.Something manifesting in your consciousness -> Something said by Spoken Language -> Something fortified by Energy -> Something heard by Your Parents' ears -> Something manifesting in their consciousness -> Something materializing in realityIf any step is not thought out or fails in execution, the spell's success rate drops significantly. The illusion *must* carry enough power to pass through each step.Our Universe is the truth, the basis of "reality," of order and balance, and your lie is not; because there are always agents of truth (or "karma") seeking to maintain balance and working against your illusion, you will need to utilize other agents (such as emotion- "energy in motion," i.e. desperation, disappointment, sadness, anger) to fortify the power of your lie/spell.If you are very in-tune with your body and connected to your consciousness, you will be able to command your body to behave in a way as if you were telling the truth to add power to the spell. This is why Western society associates "pathological liars" as socially dangerous.However, after all this I must say, if You tell the truth from the beginning- You will not have upset the balance of nature. When the pendulum swings one way- it also swings the other. When we call upon forces to manifest illusions- we're disrupting reality, which rests on Universal Balance (which is a whole other discussion for another day).As soon as you tell a lie and upset the balance- that is the second the Universe starts going in motion to work against it- the more grandeur the lie, the more grand the consequence when the truth becomes realized ("the bigger you are, the harder you fall").If you are wondering the reason why I call lies "illusions"- is because a lie by spoken word is exactly that. An illusion is not materializing "something out of nothing," you are materializing something by utilizing *consciousness.* Our consciousness is connected to our senses. It only takes a split second to deceive someone's eyes. Whether it be by a puff of smoke, or sleight of hand- that split-second of energy and motion, in which the eyes cannot truly see or the ears cannot truly hear- that is the window of opportunity to create new consciousness.You create images of reality in someone else's consciousness to materialize something you couldn't create by yourself. Therefore when I use science to "bend water," or "float while sitting," I'm materializing the power of my 'divinity' or 'supernatural ability' not just in my consciousness- but in *our* consciousness. However, like I said, though chaos energy exists and is everywhere, the universe favors balance.Magic aligned with the truth- the force/balance/nature of the Universe, will always prevail and be more powerful over magic manifested by that chaos which is against the truth, against balance and against nature. This is constant, and it is the way of our universe- it cannot be denied.In our modern age- illusions are powerful ways to cast spells and is the *most common* practice of magic today, in my opinion. One of which is lying, which is heavily accepted in the West, and is even circumstantially dubbed "White Lies," (even though it is still chaos energy). In other places of the world, lying is recognized as a form of chaos energy, or evil, and is not tolerated *at all.*Can you think of ways (other than lying) that illusion spells are cast in modern Western society?Anyway. I don't know why I wrote something this long. Maybe I will create a new thread and leave it there.God bless you and have a good day.

i just looked into it. ronald bernard was never a banker. his entire background does not appear credible at all, and it looks like he‚Äôs an anti semite with strange alt right affiliations. even people that have worked at his ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù have written articles about his strange history and behavior. if you guys want to accept this one strange mans interview prima facie as gospel, be my guest. but elite santanist jews sacrificing children and plotting world domination? im not sure i‚Äôm on board.

So by your logic you, and employees like you, can claim personal responsibility for the sub prime mortgage crisis that resulted in billions of taxpayer money being used to bail out irresponsible financial managers. Because hey, you had to be in the know right? You weren't in the dark about these sorts of things so you claim.

Well you're wrong and the LIBOR scandal proves the entire market is fixed and the FED controls the entire money supply and thus controls all markets. And if you want to be willfully ignorant and not see the big picture that's your prerogative bro.

I knew the quote before going in.  The money and prestige are not the goals for me.I'm here to help people check out of the system.  Come off your meds, use food as medicine, and reclaim your soul.If you look, there are plenty of doctors doing the same.

That‚Äôs why more than 1/2 the docs are there

I can see you're trying to engage me but I'm feeling good today so sorry man, no flame war for you. I would suggest that your 'I can't do this so neither can you' attitude might have to change at some point in your life. I don't trust any particular source or institution over another, what I don't do is continue believing something I've found to be either wrong or contradictory purely because it's easier to keep believing it.The way to do this is to start living a completely different society, because whether or not you accept this, humanity is far older then we think it is and we had all this knowledge previously. Humans haven't become super smart over the last 200 years, we've just been hoodwinked into thinking we have. 

Censorship.

His speach along with graham Hancock were originally banned from ted. But since they managed get a lot of support from the scientific community and the general public, and his 'banned' ted talk got millions of views from other small channels, they were re-instated.

I see what you mean. Sorry if I came off as a little rude in my above post. I am not a particle physicist so I will not try and debate you, but I am involved in scientific research so I will just say that if you want people to listen to you, you can't convince anyone by simply suggesting a conceptual change to the model and saying that it makes more sense. You have to identify a problem that your model solves that can't be solved by the standard model, and then people will pay attention. &#x200B;That's how it was for Einstein and all of the major model changes throughout history. Einstein wasn't just sitting on his couch thinking "hmm what if time is an illusion and it's all relative to each individual observer?" No, physicists were conducting experiments to figure out the speed of light, and they came up with the strange result that it always had the same speed, no matter what speed you're moving at. It's not relative to anything. It's like every observer is standing still, even when they're not, and light was unique in this kind of response. Everyday objects behaved as expected. So there was a crisis in the field and everyone was trying to figure out how their measurements might be wrong, whereas Einstein just said "hmm let's just stop assuming that time is universal and instead everyone has local time that can be altered by their own speed relative to light." And THEN when he put that thought down in terms of basic math equations, his equations predicted all of the data that physicists were stumped by, and it predicted some non-intuitive results from experiments that had not been done yet, which were later confirmed.&#x200B;Sorry for the history lesson if you already know all of that, but my point is if you want to convince people that they're wrong, you have to show how your model can explain things that are currently inexplicable with existing models. 

Because you do not understand the fundamental differences between science and religion, which is self-critique. Scientists publish findings, and other scientists work to disprove or replicate those findings. This check is how we maintain some standards. There are no checks in religion. There is a doctrine, and no one within the structure may challenge it. 

No, if you can simplify it and call it complex, then that is what it is simplified.I'm not sure how reality can be understood, but needing to simplify it doesn't seem to make sense... why, just because it's perceived as easier in our current way of thinking?How much got misunderstood by simplifying reality to conduct a "scientific experiment"?

That doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all. Can you please explain what you mean? Soldiers stealing oil? What?

Ja, du riechst mogen schwein pinkeln 

>Plato believed in castes, that means he believed that some people were better than others just by the social status into which they were born. Concepts of civil rights and equality hadn't been invented yet. There were slaves and indentured servants and starving people in Plato's day. He wrote what he knew of the world in his time, when city development and civic life was still in a very early stage. I think you may be judging him too harshly. He was a writer, not freaking Spartacus.

Yeah, and "Jesus" did not repudiate slavery, what a horrible person. Or we can look at how the world and norms at the time shaped them, and choose not to indict them for not living up to the moral standards of the 21st century western world...

Ok so if I'm not legitimately casting a spell, what am I doing? What's the correct action I need to take? Your whole post is confusing and indirect. We need directions instructions. Nothing vague and metaphorical. 

You can float? This I gotta see.....

no i don‚Äôt believe traders are personally responsible for the financial crisis lol, and to hold that belief is misinformed. there are a lot of market forces that resulted in the crisis. be sure though- traders being over-exposed to real estate risk is one of themi believe the organizations that incorrectly rated clos and cmbs are at fault. it‚Äôs not illegal to sell a financial product and there‚Äôs always risk involved. the rating of the products is a barometer for risk, so when they are not fitting, it‚Äôs easy for banks to become over exposed. mainly i blame irresponsible borrowers and lenders though (low rates). they‚Äôre sort of the root cause of the crisis.and as much as you guys would like to believe that the bailouts were simply because banks are buddy-buddy with the government, it was more to prevent total financial collapse. after all, banks (were, and still are) the backbone of any capitalist regime

interesting read. i would hesitate to take the word of one anonymous money manager from some anonymous hedge fund as gospel though although there is an ever increasing trend towards passive investing (at least for now) as its lower cost and tends to counter intuitively beat active investing.i would be more interested though if you could point me to a single red flag company, that despite lacking the merits or fit into an index, it remains on the index. this could indicate better something malicious. if all the companies on the index well, belong on the index, then there‚Äôs really no substantial argument.

logic bro.. the libor scandal doesn‚Äôt prove the ‚Äúentire market is fixed‚Äù... it proves that banks at one time were willing to increase or decrease libor to profit on specific trade positions..  why wouldn‚Äôt they lol. they are the ones who determine libor. this isn‚Äôt some deep malicious conspiracy. and, this particular scandal proves private sector bank control (like jpm or gs) lmao not the fed or any of the government banks you mentioned. you‚Äôre right in that fed controls money supply, but in reality they just infrequently raise or lower rates a small fraction of a percent (in response to current market conditions) in efforts to control growth. it‚Äôs quite an overstatement to say they control ‚Äúall markets‚Äù lol. i‚Äôm not being willfully ignorant, i‚Äôm being realistic and pragmatic. in reality it‚Äôs you being willfully ignorant, succumbing to confirmation biases based on false pretense. if you want to debate any of these points though, i welcome it

Not sure what scientific journals you‚Äôre reading, but no anthropologist thinks human intelligence changed like you‚Äôre describing in the last hundreds of years.

*quietly re-instated 

No problem! Trust me I've experienced much much more rudeness from others in the science field.My field is specifically genomics, because of that I needed to understand the 3d structure of the genome from the bottom up in order to understand [this](https://youtu.be/Tn5qgEqWgW8) kind of thing, I stumbled on the only way to build large structures from the bottom up, a unified theory of physics (not my own!) Due to my expertise it made sense to take a structural, biological take on seeing if a new theory can explain something simply that was very complex before. So I decided to build DNA and the amino acids from the bottom up, in 3D, and the pieces all yielded 3d building blocks that look just like lewis structures but 3D, very hard to ignore.The thing is we live at an interesting time, where almost everything CAN be explained and has been using complicated theories. What a new theory will do is not necessarily explain all the unknown, but it will explain what other theories can (observables), and then some, using a smaller number of rules.

Ah, you actually don't understand how a society formulates a creation myth based off of the best available knowledge. Creation myths are true according to the information of the time.Just because it's a "scientific theory" doesn't mean it doesn't take the role of creation myth.

What was the Vatican council? That wasn't self critique?

That's what the point of this thread is about. Science is becoming a religion. The peer-review process is being abused. Corporate interests are steering studies for desired results. The gate-keeping of information is preventing real innovation from occurring. 

You can only be said to know what you are talking about when you can understand and explain a complex phenomena in simple terms...Understanding something and being able to explain it doesn't effect the truth of the explanation. It actually makes it better.

lol thats the point brother, you used a weak ass strawman so I gave an equivalent on a different conspiracy 

No doubt, they didn‚Äôt have a chance to live up to modern moral standards *because they were literally inventing them at that time*...

Your questions are legitimate...but the answers you want to hear aren't the ones you will get. There is no "magical" answer to these.What it takes is a journey of one's self to discover one's self. It is such a personal journey that it is not the same for each individual. What I found helpful was to start researching spiritual alchemy...The process of changing one from the inside out. First you must be able to identify who you truly are and what you truly believe. Ask yourself...Why do I believe the things that I think are so. Is it because my parents told this to me? I was taught them in school? I went to church as a kid and that's why I believe them? You have to be able to identify the programs that are running in your subconscious that affects the way you look at the world and interpret it. Then you need to be able to destroy those...then and only then, can you start to reshape the way that reality can appear to you.A word of warning...If your committed to this process, it can be scary, daunting and lead to a total revolution of you as a person. But oh so liberating and freeing once you start to see personal progress.

There is no map to enlightenment.  Religions have been trying to do exactly this for thousands of years, largely without success./u/3rdeyenotblind has some excellent advice.It is a personal journal, and it is different for each person.  The first thing to do is to investigate the source of your thoughts and beliefs and attempt to determine whether these thoughts are actually yours.  If not, where do they come from?  Do you want to choose to continue to believe them?  If so, why (or why not)?A meditative practice is an excellent tool for exploring.  It does not matter whether you practice yoga, keep a daily sit spot, practice mindfulness with a mobile phone app, or whatever, so long as you do practice.  Faith is the guide.  Find your faith, and you will find your map.

Okay. So that person is being super vague under the guise of trying to help. He is talking about *Magick*."Spells" aren't supernatural. The whole thing is basically about finding a way to associate things to keep you dedicated to imposing your will on either yourself or others.I have a necklace. It was gifted to me by my brother. One day I just decided "this is going to relax me". Now when I wear it and get flustered, I can feel it under my shirt and it helps me not get pissed. Just the gravity of it. That's a spell. You could very well just call "spells" "decisions" Just make associations that relate to you. 

I think one part of the confusion is OP has misspelled 'magick'. Speaking of which what is 'spelling' and why don't we call putting letters together to make words, lettering or wording? Also consider we call the most negative or forbidden words "curse" words. So curses and spells.. sounds a bit like Harry Potter but afaik we can't make things levitate or fly on brooms.  Magick is defined as "the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will"The reason we speak is so that people **hear** and **respond** to what we are saying. If a parent were to say to their child "Go to the store and buy me some milk." and 30 minutes later the child is walking back into the house milk in hand; The parent has just effectively used magick. Had they not uttered those spells and in that order they would still be milk-less. We know that sounds and vibrations have an effect on human physiology. Everyday we listen to music that has an effect on our mood or even cause us to dance. Now imagine how powerful a technology like radio or television could be in using words or spells to manipulate people into ['conforming with your will'.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blYD_o9uQn8)  

Seek direction from yourself by inquiring into the true nature of yourself and reality. Don't look for direction externally. Ask yourself a million times and in a million ways "what am I".

You can downplay the significance of LIBOR all you want but the IBS and IMF are certainly in on the fix and made public declarations there wasn't fixing but there was. We are talking about 350$ trillion in derivatives, student loans, pensions, etc. that are manipulated. The fed controls the money supply and could induce bull or bear markets at will and has in the past. In a perfect world we would have rational efficient markets and no bad actors but let's be real here it's all a crock of shit if you dig deep enough.

And are you an anthropologist? 

That's top-down level directing. You don't need to be in a position of power to be a scientist critical of another scientist's work. 

If you need to simply something, then you maybe only understood that you could not understand it in its complete

I didn‚Äôt. You say the earth is flat but you‚Äôre not a scientist lol. I have empirical evidence because I work in that field. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm lying to people lol.What I meant is do you think all he images and videos from space are fake? Also studies etc etc. Sat√©lites etc.? Again, no disrespect. I‚Äôve never had a real discussion with flat earth people. They usually go from that to anti vaccine, etc etc

Correct. People don't understand the innate value of the journey itself. Understanding will elude those who do not become the answer they seek. To become the answer, to find the knowledge, to be the thing which knows what it didn't before, it's all about the journey. It's a becoming, not a knowing. That's at the root at pretty much all occult systems. The big answers are ones nobody can provide for you.People like the one you're responding to are even close to asking the questions. They're still fetuses asleep in the womb. The womb being this matrix.

Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism offer pretty clear maps to enlightenment. The Council of Nicea fucked that up for Christianity. 

Finally someone who uses plain English and a clear explanation of how to do a thing. Thank you. 

Yes... Aleister Crowley's differentiation. He did understand language as symbols and symbols tied to consciousness- but the little I've read from him didn't address Universal balance. I responded to the skeptical user and addressed that. While I wouldn't necessarily agree with that example, because we cannot exist without interaction- interaction is not without cause and effect, and the effect doesn't always change consciousness, (in this case, because obedience would already be a part of the state of consciousness in a relationship between parent and child).God bless.

Is this a strawman argument you‚Äôre trying to setup? Try to answer my original question. What authority do you trust more than science if it‚Äôs so flawed? Religion? Government? Media? By nature you have to trust other people in order to learn in this complex world, and I stand firm scientific theory is the best shot we have at knowledge as a human race. 

You don't? A PhD has the same respect as you and I in the peer review system?

Well I guess start providing me some evidence if you are a scientist. 

or ^ :D

It was a clear statement to begin with

>By nature you have to trust other people in order to learn in this complex worldYour premise is incorrect and implies a requirement for an intellectual authority. Personally I trust spirituality and spiritual teachings. They can be verified by an individual, it could be argued they are only verifiable by individuals and not groups.That 'best shot' at knowledge was just shown by myself and numerous other people in this thread to be corrupted to the core by interest groups. Not wanting to accept that is called cognitive dissidence. Refer to my well analogy. 

Never said I was a scientist . I‚Äôm an intelligence analyst as I mentioned and I work with sat√©lites and MQ-9. Do you work with anything space related or just get info form conspiracy websites? If the earth was flat that all of that would fall right out of window which would mean my eyes and other thousands of people in the world are going crazy and seeing things that aren‚Äôt there. I give you plenty of proofIf the earth were flat Russia wouldn‚Äôt just be able to fly from there country around to our California borders and our ships wouldn‚Äôt be able to leave from our ports and port in China through the pacific. This isn‚Äôt smart stuff just common sense. I know pilots who flew ant√°rtica missions and heavy bombers who flew long missions around the world. They do it all the time. Why haven‚Äôt they fallen off the earth? I debriefed these pilots.https://sites.eveyo.com/news/world-news/146624-blitzed-by-remote-control-from-a-desk-thousands-of-miles-away-how-u-s-and-british-spies-targeted-jihadi-john-with-a-laser-guided-missile-fired-from-a-drone-after-months-of-painstaking-surveillance.htmlHow do you prove the earth is flat? How come no one has fallen off the earth or hit big walls of ice? Just curious if you can send me some info that would be awesome.I can never get real answers and the dudes are usually crazy af. Educate me.The less educated always seem to fall into these crazy conspiracies like Gucci mane being cloned and stupid shit like that lol. Always the same dudes.

master yourself.once you have zero addictions , the fittest you can be, and have conquered materialism... you will know the answer.i'm not even halfway there yet... but it feels right.

I guess the thought process is that the earth is flat and motionless by all accounts of my personal experience and I have come to find the ball earth evidence insufficient for my personal belief. Part of the mind fuck is that you have to prove the earth is flat based on the axiom the earth is a ball.Look up the history of Jesuit spread of ball earth theory in the 17th century, China thought the earth was flat until 1600s when a Jesuit priest gained favor in the Imperial court. They must be crazy af in China yo. History of Antarctica, like how it wasn't discovered until 1820 and the Operations there with Admiral Byrd and his infamous TV interview. Ancient cultures and the belief in flat earth and a firmament, extra credit for Werhner von Braun's tombstone bible verse. See Operation Domino, Fishbowl, Starfish. That's a good chunk of stuff to start with. 

Very interesting bro I‚Äôll start right now. Sounds and cool not gonna lie. I‚Äôll get back to you on my opinion. Thanks man 

No problem, a lot people write flat earth off without doing their homework first.Like pretty much anyone I thought flat earth was retarded before "looking into it".If you are being intellectually honest you should come away from flat earth theory with at least some cool history lessons.

 

Glad to see this discussion. I think small changes could yield big results. I don't see one solution or fix or answer to how the sub should run, what it should look like and what should be at the top. imo there's no magic bullet due to the nature of the subject, namely- Conspiracies are based on disagreement, no? discussing, researching, thinking about them... isn't it all built on seeking some truth, understanding, information or popular consensus that should be addressed/accepted but is not-- because people disagree. on events, on motive, on sources and evidence, etc. And I'm just talking about folks participating in good faith here; I don't think it's an exaggeration to say it'd be hard to find... 3 people in this sub who believe the same truths behind all the most debated conspiracies. There's gonna be one mystery where 3 smart people agree 9 times, get to the 10th, look at the same info and see 3 totally different things. That seems inseparable from a conspiracy community to me. It's not convenient in terms of, you know, subreddit tranquility, but hey it's a unique place. most subreddits like I dunno fucking... /r/ITookAPicture- aren't based on people passionately debating controversial issues and trying to convince or exchange information with people, who are probably like-minded except for all the stuff they passionately disagree about. Even the debate-oriented subs like whatever /r/asksomefella  aren't remotely similar. imo this sub is unique and will always have disagreement on everything from posts to moderation. honest arguments. legit bafflement at how someone could believe this but not that. For the same reasons there's probably just gonna be friction or misunderstanding between the community and the mods. so again l think it's more fruitful to look for progress than solutions. I mean, would you want to be a moderator here? really? you want to deal with the notoriously combative and antagonistic CelineHagbard? jkbut really, think about the (volunteer) job description. there's 4,000 people here atm and you have to clean up and make judgement calls about what breaks which rules while thousands of anons argue over the missing sum when something don't add up. and you're constantly insulted. and there's like admins that pop in occasionally. In return you get some power and responsibility for a subject and community you care about and want to affect, even though your job is mostly dealing with its worst parts. I don't want to meet the person who spends substantial time modding here and doesn't get pissed off on occasion. I'm not saying this in defense of the mods, they can defend themselves and they make mistakes. cause humans do that. so do those shifty robot mods. But I'd sure as hell defend the mods over some other 19 redditors who think they wouldn't quit after a week. (just no one tell them there's a public modlog though. if I was trying to pull one over i'd get rid of that thing stat.Anyway, as someone who has never contributed anything of value to the sub, or regularly participated, or done anything to earn trust here, I'm sure my opinion carries a great deal of weight. For the sub's future I see plenty of opportunities for general, can-live-with-it improvements. Possibilities: clarifying rules and consquences, communication, transparency, what's politics vs what's a good topic that is also political. post limits? tags/filters?. Poke the admins with a stick? (sue them? ~~make the sub private until you solve a riddle~~  that's dumb I was thinking about trolls, like under a bridge. But hey, I bet anything yall could write an article a decent site would frontpagerize. for real, fucking no one likes the popular media these days. they're desperate for something that critical 15-65 demographic finds interesting. cause it turns out selling your data isn't a lucrative longterm strategy. and then the media moguls see a kid on patreon making $15,000 a month $3 at a time because they're fucking engaging. and they're like wtf why won't they pay $15 a month for my newspaper. we're running out of moguls man, they keep jum Last, on the past of this sub- can only speak for myself but my memory's a rascal. I find it really worthwhile to check out rconspiracy 2,3, 5 whatever years ago once in a while (via archive for instance). Obviously some things change and some things don't, but it's never the things I expect. and personally seeing old front pages and old discussions adds a little perspective to the present discussions.

 

I am an extremely casual user for this subreddit. I don't post here often at all, I mostly just lurk now and then. That probably makes me look more then a little suspicious what with current going ons, but I wanted to throw out my two cents here.This place, being under constant brigade attack as it is, is simply unusable. The core community is to small to generate momentum to overrule the obvious brigading. That's how bigger subs like r/PCMasterrace dealt with this crap, it was so big and has so much momentum that it just brushed it aside.I honestly don't know if there is a solution to this. The r/politics and other subreddit hiveminds have decided we are their blood enemy now, and those types will not stop unless utterly and completely shut down. I honestly don't know how you would go about doing that while preserving the ideals of free speech this place is built on in the first place.

What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty and democracy? ~Mahatma Gandhi

I'm almost certain this will get buried, but that's fine.What this sub needs most is the "No Meta" rule active *all the time*. If you want to talk about users of this sub make a self post, or take it to one of the litany of subs dedicated to talking about the users here. It's the most ridiculous and disrupting nonsense in every single thread we have users with "you guys are nuts" or "this place is full of t_D people" or some other such non-relevant disruption.

As long as there's no mod accountability process, no transparent election process, no term limits, then Reddit is a stacked deck.

I propose sub wide contest mode until November 7th. Vote counts can influence a voters decision and by hiding them we can make sure no one on this sub is directly exposed to astroturfed propaganda.

Could we have a requirement that in every submission statement the poster has to reference the conspiracy they are addressing?

This post so far: how to keep users and mods happy when they clash.What we want: how mods can help us to be able to focus on conspiracy in a damn conspiracy sub!EDIT: totally downvote out of the gate. Does that mean someone with votepower wants:To help us NOT focus on conspiracy?To focus instead on problem-user-mods?Hmmm this may be a clue to what‚Äôs going on. Vote scratch the messenger...

Do the mods here use alts, and if so, why?

this is just a trick to get me banned again. I just got reinstated, keeping quiet for now. I'll just read the comments.

I think its hilarious the sheer amount of turnover of mods, the propensity for sub mods to be suspended BY ADMINS,  hell even the top mod has gotten some nice Admin approved vacation, the total political slant to one side thus making this sub an echo chamber for a certain type, and the persistent effort to do things secretly and with no consideration for sub user bases wishes. Why the rule for account age requirements when the mods go through and approve and allow brand new accounts to participate. Hell, when that rule was made suddenly there was a flurry of perfectly aged accounts ready rearing to participate. But yet again only from one political viewpointWhile mod log helps. They clearly are communicating elsewhere. Likely on discord. How about the sub mods tamp down the blatant preferential treatment of certain users and posts that are clearly from a single standpoint. This sub has been a joke since the election. And it warrants the ostracism it receives.   

Does anyone want to meet up?  Big r/conspiracy party?

Is there any sort of review process for bans?I mainly ask because u/Aleister  went on a banning spree which you guys have defended as only removing "bad actors" and such. However, one of those banned was an ex-moderator for "brown nosing," and the ban was only lifted about a week later because Aleister caught an admin ban and you needed someone to fill the hole. Presumably they are not a "bad actor" since you guys have since given them mod privileges, so it looks like Aleister was just acting on personal grudges which throws the rest of that ban wave into question, if not all of his actions.This suggests that there's not any sort of process to ensure that your mods are actually banning bad actors and not just carrying out personal grievances. How many of those Aleister banned were not actually warranted, he just didn't like them for whatever reason? People point at the mod log as an example of the mods here being "transparent, " but it's frankly useless because any suspicious bannings (and there are many) are hand waved by the mods as "bad actors" (and citing the mod log often catches users a ban for Rule 10). There's just a major trust issue between the users and mods, and if the mods want it to be fixed they're going to have to go above and beyond in showing why a ban is deserved, or why a problem user has had their ban rescinded.

Show me how this whole discussion is going to be different than any other post AP puts a sticky on.It's literally all that ever ends up getting discussed imo.Title should be "How to bait a brigade"...because that's exactly what's going to happen.Am I wrong?The past - Is permanently irretrievable.The present - According to users who get the most upvotes in most discussion threads on the front page (especially anything to do with MSM narratives regarding current conspiracies that have anything to do with politics) this sub is T_D 2.0. According to users who get downvoted into oblivion in those threads..it's not. You do the math.The future - Partisan shit slinging, blatant inorganic vote manipulation of front page posts that cover anything to do with current political events, continued anonymous vote suppression of conspiracy speculations that don't follow the MSM narrative and more cries of victim-hood by users who for the most part received a ban for generally being toxic asshats and really don't believe in most conspiracy theories and don't take part in discussions that don't involve politics.More brigades...lots more brigades. I'm sure the admins of reddit are working really hard to curtail this phenomenon that only seems to be observed by the genuine users of r/conspiracy. (I guess we all have our tinfoil hats screwed on a little to tight)Continued attacks on mods because we all know that until this sub is completely taken over by users that believe the truth can only be presented by the MSM nothing is going to change. I'm just a ray of fuckin sunshine...but am I wrong? Let me know when this comment hits -150. Oh...almost forgot...you're going to ask me to focus on what can be done to make r/conspiracy a better sub now aren't you? Why spend time whining about how things are...right?You know what's funny...I guarantee you, the top comment of this post...will be whining about how shitty this sub is because of how it's modded...guaranteed.Because that's what they're really after isn't it? Mods that parrot the MSM narrative.Edit: I was surprised to see my comment made it to +8....that's obviously changing now. I'm sure no one is having a discussion on discord right now regarding the formation of the incoming brigade. Or maybe they just hit a notification that alerts their "circle of friends"...I always thought that was a pretty obvious tool designed specifically for brigading. Zuckerberg would be proud.

I would absolutely love to see a full-time implementation of Contest Mode, for all posts. 

What will keep this sub from getting quarantined like /r/911truth ? Is anyone worried about the long term survival of this sub? Reddit continues to March toward their IPO.

We need to create a "gentlemen's guide to TMOR disruption tactics" and allow users to post sections of it whenever a TMOR shill shows up ie. without ban repercussions.

Thank you mods for enabling a user-level discussion aimed at the mod-level and higher levels of oversight!I wish there was some way to completely defuse the issue of political ideologies at least for the duration of this discussion. It is clear that part of the problem users are fighting to overcome is the overwhelming turn of this sub from a conspiracy focus to a partisan focus.Everyone with any sense knows that conspiracy involves politics. What was JFK - a political assasination. However that assasination would never have become a conspiracy without the growing awareness of massive evidence indicating foul play, being covered up at the highest level.What we see now on this subreddit is purely politics with no assasination, no evidence, no coverup, no high level interventions, and not even the time required to assess these factors that lead to a true conspiracy subject.In short, we have political forces hijacking our discussions in order to achieve immediate short term results in the non-conspiracy world of partisan politics.In my mind, we asked mods to stop it. That didn‚Äôt happen. Why?EDIT: here is an analogy for what I‚Äôm trying to get at: let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm a geologist. As a geologist I am involved with drilling. Every once and a while I go somewhere and drill to find out what I need to understand geology better. Then one day the drilling company shows up at my house and starts drilling a bunch of holes in my front yard. I have to explain that I‚Äôm interested in drilling but I‚Äôm not a driller myself and I certainly don‚Äôt want someone to come to my home and ruin it by drilling a bunch of holes. It‚Äôs not appropriate and it shouldn‚Äôt be legal. Mods - you should be on my side, not theirs.

Conspiracy of 3-4 years ago basically won the culture war.People quit believing in MSM fairytales, the people who once populated this place are now winning battles and the alternative media is now more popular in views/engagement than the MSM.The MSM now is trying to "occupy" alt-media like YouTube, Reddit etc etc and working with big tech they are trying to shut down the alt-media or rather to just make YouTube/Reddit ECT ECT the new way people watch CNN and company.The aftermath is all the good conversation we had here years ago is moving to other platforms like minds.com gab.ai etc etc.  No hard feelings, it's like watching Myspace slowly die when Facebook showed up.  If your frustrated with this decline then it's just because you're a late-adopter. Everyone who matters has already migrated, a few of us still comment here to torture ourselves or out of morbid curiosity watching this site die.Look at politics right now, the headlines and comments are so fucking insane and hyperbolic that it looks like an Alex Jones fever dream.We won folks.  You know who you are, we just kicked the ever living shit out of the globalist and everything happening here that says otherwise is an attempted salvage operation by the globalist.To all of those who fought here with us years ago in the age of conspiratard, thanks for your service and support.  I hope you find the new venues of free speech out there, we'll be there waiting for you.

One thing that I have noticed recently is that some of you ask where does the community go if r/conspiracy is lost? I personally doubt that there would be a replacement. Sure, you could find new forums to speak in and share information but they will be constructed for you, not by you. These echo chambers will be populated by the splintered communities of the past and curated in a way to control the conversation.R/conspiracy needs to be a place people can feel free to share their opinions and information. Follow the rules, practice proper etiquette, and give other‚Äôs opinions the respect they deserve. I understand that there is now a flood of fake/controlled users, but that is something we will just have to accept and work around.

On Gab.Gab shouldn't have been shut down, because Gab shouldn't have existed in the first place. Those people and views shouldn't have been intellectually quarantined; because toxic and stupid opinions aren't contagious. Anyone going over to Gab would have been indoctrinated because there was no intellectual inner check to that community, not an inner check provide by the platform(forced censorship) but by other users (natural and organic logical objection). To cut those people and views off from the rest of society, is to normalize their opinions amongst themselves. The Pittsburgh shooter thought his views were right, cause his whole community said it was. I'd argue if that community hadn't of been intellectually segregated from Twitter in the first place he wouldn't have felt as confident and assured in his views. All opinions can and should be expressed, most importantly, the views and opinions from others about those views. To cut these people off from the rest of Twitter, is to cut bad views and urges off from a person‚Äôs rational inner check or conscience. What happens to the urges they get unleashed with devastating harmful effects to all.This is a political opinion, and it shouldn't be here, it should be over on mainstream reddit

Is there any way that you can prevent raiders from easily censoring comments? It's ridiculous that all these people need to do is to organize into little groups, get 5 down votes per user, and spam propaganda to pretty much hijack and destroy a discussion.

I'm not exactly sure, what we should be talking about in this round table, lol...

Questions for Mods:1. What data can you see that an ordinary user cannot?2. Do you have tools to help you to identify bots and shills?3. Are there policies that limit the number of puppet accounts you can use?4. Can a single mod with multiple accounts vote on the same post or comment?5. Do mods combine with each other and nonplayers to vote and is that considered ethical in the reddit system?

Are there any left of center mods?

This is an important Round Table. To preface ill start with an Alan Watts quote.Camus said there is only really one serious philosophical question, which is whether or not to commit suicide. I think there are four or five serious philosophical questions.1. Who started it?  2. Are we gonna make it?  3. Where are we gonna put it?  4. Who's gonna clean up?  5. Is it serious?  No you should not kill yourself. One absolute truth is everything constantly changes, even truth. The reason or reasons you want to kill yourself will change. The rest of us need you even if it doesn't seem like it. As the african word Ubuntu translates  **‚ÄúI am what I am because of who we all are.‚Äù**Now im going to apply those 5 philosophical question to this discussion.1. Steve Huffman, Aaron Swartz and Alexis Ohanian. 2. Reddit has been an obvious success. Despite the negative sides (trolls/shills/bots/corporate influence/ect). Millions of positive ideas, pictures, and videos have rippled through humanity because it exists. We make it happen! We already made it! And we will continue to make it!  3. We put it on https://www.reddit.com and that has worked for years now. Jumping back to the negative side. With corporations, private entities, bad mods censoring our ideas, pictures, and videos. It has become apparent we need to put it elsewhere. I propose a new website be created which replicates reddits medium and layout. Or at very least a new website that replicates reddits medium and layout for the purpose of being an uncensored(to an extent), anti-corporate, bot resistant version of /r/conspiracy. I think this is of fundamental importance.  4. That would be us. How we do it is still on the table. Can we do it? Of course we can.  5. It is very serious. Without a place to share important information those in power will continue to divide and conquer. I just crunched the numbers for the geometic mean of death tolls from War from 1899 till now from Wikipedia(I know its not accurate) an estimated 150,573,368 peope have died. That is the definition of serious. We need UNITY and PEACE not death tolls in the hundreds of millions.

To everyone that went thru the first day of this circus: everything is upside down in the reality the power posters control. The top comments have the least real impact on the status of the sub. Their plan was to make this about power mods and power users - the kind of users that think they own the place - the kind of people who play games and can jigger the votes so everybody thinks they have all the answers.&#x200B;Well somebody has to call them out. The whole reason for this round table was to get the mods to own up as to why the sub has changed so drastically - to the point where real conspiracy theorists cannot find a decent discussion amongst all the imported background noise.&#x200B;That hasn‚Äôt happened and it won‚Äôt happen until the rest of us make a lot more waves. Something is rotten in this sub and in this post. Every sensible person can see that the first comments got 18 votes and 12 and 8 and then vote shaped the discussion with slides and alts so it looks like its just about bad actors (whose side are they really on and why do they act so wild?) and good mods doing their job. &#x200B;I think the most productive move would be to ask all mods to voluntarily step aside to assure the regular users that they are not being played or manipulated by insiders who would like this sub to self destruct.&#x200B;I‚Äùm not calling any user or mod out. We all know enough - good or not - to see we have an honesty problem.

Why is an Auto-Moderator comment stickied to the top of every thread and why are the vote counts hidden here for a period of time?

I would recommend a unified strategy to combat trolls, brigading, and shilling. Mods have no power to ban these people, and admins refuse to do anything in spite of overwhelming evidence, so we should consider ways to combat them within the rules of engagement established.Many would like to see rule 10 removed, so that we can have an open discussion on shills. I see the mods' point that this will make the community more toxic, because the newer members (i.e. people who don't know how to spot [shilling techniques](http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/)) will just leave the community because they don't have the discernment to decide who is making correct accusations, and who is just poisoning the well.An interesting idea would be a rule requiring comments to contain substance. Most of the shilling involves shouting down ideas they want to suppress, because it tricks a few people and it divides the rest. A rule requiring you to explain your reasons for disagreeing with another user would kill the majority of the shilling activity off.We could even consider bans on a few common forms of logical fallacies. But that runs the risk of getting a lot of the newer people (i.e. those we actually want to reach) because they lack the skills to avoid these fallacies.In any case, continuing to focus on the shilling *behavior* is going to be the key. It doesn't matter if someone is paid to be here, if they are *acting* like a shill by bringing in logical fallacies and divisiveness instead of substantive discussion, they should be confronted about their behavior. You don't have to call someone a shill to note that their argument is fallacious and divisive, even to the point of calling out the specific tactic they are using.

If the modlog is our only way to see how the mods are spending their time here.. then where is it?  Somebody link to that baby. The screenshots show how mods aren't doing their job, their playing games with their friends, like where's the tagging of MSM we've been asking for the last two years?  Instead they spend their time and authority gatekeeping according to a very obvious political agenda.  Just pathetic.  

This place is kind of fucked honestly, enough that I have considered abandoning efforts here and moving on to something else. It's become a war of attrition as trolls and shills degrade the conversation and drive sensible people away. As a self-described sensible person I would feel remorse jumping ship, but we're a-goin' down.\*"Is it just me? Or is the world... rising?"\*Where is the line, for each of us? Researching criminal and cult control of the levers of power is a thankless job. While I don't want David Brock and his pedo buddies to win in any way shape or form, it would be dishonest to pretend their bot and shill army is ineffective. Like we can admit news shows lie and people believe the lies without endorsing their foul tactics. We gotta live in reality. I might not be fooled as often as some but I get drawn into debates and arguments with phonies. It takes a toll emotionally.They want us to give up. We won't. But unless there are some serious changes it's going to become as self-defeating as criticizing Facebook while on Facebook as a user. Kind of a double bind here, to leave reddit or stay, neither option is all that attractive considering the circumstances. I'm thinking about a new format, maybe a website with organized articles and moderated comments. Dissent would never be deleted, but you could give warnings or bans for personal attacks. There is no justification to call someone an idiot or crazy for having a different opinion anyways.One could argue for the natural born right to stir shit, gaslight, and post divisive, disingenuous nonsense. I have had my fill of reading it.It's obvious the admins are complicit. Them deleting pizzagate was the stimulus that made me dive deeper and discover most of the accusations were true. TMOR is the admin's sociopath harassment club, they need to call someone dumb to feel smart and crazy to feel sane. I shake my head.Some of my serious research posts with lists of sources have 1,000s of views and like 10 net upvotes. That's not natural.So long and thanks for all the toxic fish. I may or may not be around as a commenter. If I post less and drift away it's not to give up on research and awareness but to find a new venue. The nature of reddit's structure is easily manipulated and too transitory.

Do not understand a word! What does "going full on meta" mean? What "this one"? Does anyone clarify it for a non-native speaker?

Can we get the mods to start removing random opinion articles getting posted here? If the author is trying to use it to support a *conspiracy* theory, that's fine, but there is just so much spill over from r/politics and r/news - most of it obviously political - and it's getting annoying.

Maybe the heavily brigaded  ## ["Please shut down the Manipulative Down-Voting" Petition](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9t9fbk/please_shut_down_the_manipulative_downvoting/)could be considered by the mods, either?

Why isn't the "send replies to my inbox" option not a one click question in preferences rather than something we need to deal with and click every time we make a submission?

Unban CNN articles from being posted?  

Honestly just get rid of the sub, it‚Äôs turned into r/politics 

If I was the benevolent dictator of r/conspiracy, I would go to approved commenters only. Each person who wants to participate has to fill out an application.In order to participate, the applicant has to be "conspiracy-positive". Debates over individual conspiracies would be very welcome but anyone who is skeptical of conspiracies *in general* would not be allowed to post or comment.The application would also weed out racists.Acceptance that politics is nothing more than the entertainment wing of the shadow government is necessary Attached to the application must be an OC post, to demonstrate the applicants commitment to thinking critically about a subject and to share it with others.Accepted applicants would have their OC displayed in a stickied megathread.For a little bit of time participation would fall off a cliff and it would be hundreds of hours of work for the mods but this is my dream. 

[removed]

i feel like we could use more pretending to be a open free speech forum.there are far too many people actually trying to learn whats going on, and wanting to make the world a better place, we could quickly stamp out this unwanted behavior with more shadow banning!

I've said a few things here and there, but [this is all I really want to say today.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMDdXdguo_4)

Lets talk about the bird‚Äôs and the bee‚Äôs

The issue in implementing tags here [Politics], [Reptilians], [etc] is everything can be defined as politics if you try hard enough.We have been discussing this idea of trialing tags for months.I think we should at least try to implement it when we all decide what to do when this thread is done.

Why not a political conspiracy sub?

>What are we going to do with the umpteen daily political posts that is basically drowning actual, proper conspiracy theories?Limit political posts to one or two days a week, perhaps?What about politics only on the weekends (which are quieter anyway)?

Thanks a million. You could own your own reddit if you wanted to.

Can you check if some top "contributers" always post around the same. Maybe by binning short time windows and doing a pearson correlation analysis?

Could you tell us who the top 3 banned users are and the top 3 users with the most comments removed?Edit: users replies were deleted, but they showed rmfn with over 200 comments removed. The next closest non-bot that wasn't mass removed was 60-something. It also showed him and putinlovescats with 5-6 bans each. 

 

Lets hunt for some shills. Give us the top 5 user names that down vote the most and terms that appear in those threads and/or comments.Or how about trends that either massively upvote or downvote a thread/comment within minutes. For example, If someone posts a thread about Monsanto causing cancer, then you see a wave of downvotes, who were those users? Or a comment arguing against the claim, then all of a sudden it gets +20 upvotes, who were those users?

What about me? Boxers or briefs?

Good intent but imho impossible to make the cut: some news outlet somewhere has mentioned 9-11 or UFOs in the last 2 hrs let alone what‚Äôs been blathered the last 2 months.Possibly could work if we only allowed mods to ‚Äújudiciously‚Äù cross post r/news worldnews politics to keep us informed but then absolutely ban topics being actively covered in those subs

Or MSM

This is a really good observation, thanks!

You are absolutely correct!  Reddit's design for moderation is complete bullshit and honestly fucked up.  I will at the least say this, the mods here offer a mod log, which speaks volumes for the amount of shit they receive for continuing to offer it. Can anyone else show me a similar sub this large, that offers the same transparency as here?

Are there any subreddits that vote on mods that have term limits?  

I'd like to expand on this and ask why some users are given so much more leeway than others? There are a couple of prominent users who have been banned and unbanned dozens of times but still keep coming back somehow. What do these users offer to this sub that outweighs all of the rules they constantly break? Why should any user be given that much leniency when they clearly aren't changing their behavior after each ban? 

Just seen this buisness here tooUser was banned by ambiguously yesterday for what looks like rule 10, same user unbanned by axolotl today What is also odd is ambiguously banned the guy but approved his rule breaking comment. The rules seem to depend on which mod sees the report and which phase the moon is inhttps://imgur.com/a/bEWvW1OIt was [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9r00ij/potential_explosive_devices_sent_to_hillary/e8de4v4?context=3)

Aleister and RecoveringGrace both had their accounts suspended. As far as I've seen, the official explanation is that Aleister manually approved a comment that provided real life information on someone, aka doxxing. I'm not sure if there was more to it than that, but it is kind of weird how we still haven't had a mod post about this.RecoveringGrace is a bit more convoluted, so someone please correct me if I have any details wrong. I think they got in an argument with some TMOR user and threatened to doxx them. They were given a temporary suspension for this, and then proceeded to message the user with an alt account, aka ban evading. That's when they were given the permanent suspension.Either way, that's two of the five newest mods who are now suspended. A third had resigned at one point but is now back. 3/5 is not a very high success rate, so again I want to bring up how flawed this secret vote process seems to be. Edit: To address some of the other mods, creq and IntellisaurDinoAlien haven't been active in 3 months. Amos_quito hasn't been active in 9 months. I have no clue what is going on in their real lives, but it sorta seems like the mods are dropping like flies around here. 

Admin banned them! Also, happy cake day!

To be fair, it is listed under the criteria of a Submission Statement - but I've never seen it enforced.

There is no rule that requires every post here to have a uniquely identifiable conspiracy.[Please see my response here](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9rb012/rconspiracy_round_table_18_the_past_present/e8gcc86/).

Completely agree. There's very inorganic activity on certain topics where even considering a conspiracy theory as possible gets you downvoted to oblivion. It's obvious and ridiculous, and we need more ways to combat it. 

What if the default postings here were flaired as [No Meta], meaning that comments in a specific thread are restricted to the topic posted and anything else (shitting on users, mods, the sub, etc) would be removed?/u/CelineHagbard has made quite a few posts of that nature.

The admins encourage the mods of big subs to use alts.

I'm curious which side of the political spectrum do you think it shifted to? Because I hear claims it shifted to the far right, but find that certain topics are heavily manipulated by mainstream left-wing viewpoints. 

>I think its hilarious the sheer amount of turnover of mods, the propensity for sub mods to be suspended BY ADMINS,  hell even the top mod has gotten some nice Admin approved vacation, the total political slant to one side thus making this sub an echo chamber for a certain type, and the persistent effort to do things secretly and with no consideration for sub user bases wishes. APs issue with reddit was not a disciplinary action but a connection issue where *they* did not like how he was connecting to the site (Tor nodes IIRC).>Why the rule for account age requirements when the mods go through and approve and allow brand new accounts to participate. New accounts will occassionally message the mods to have a newer account approved,  and they are granted on a case by case basis after they explain the reasoning and let us know their other account. You don't see any of this.>Hell, when that rule was made suddenly there was a flurry of perfectly aged accounts ready rearing to participate. But yet again only from one political viewpoint[Citation required here]>While mod log helps. They clearly are communicating elsewhere. Likely on discord. Who is communicating on discord? New accounts?>How about the sub mods tamp down the blatant preferential treatment of certain users and posts that are clearly from a single standpoint. AP already addressed this.>This sub has been a joke since the election. And it warrants the ostracism it receives.   Then why are you here?

Yep. 

No thanks fbi

 

You are not wrong. The pattern of manipulation is very obvious to any honest, long-term, organic user. 

I think we need some mod elections. Aleister, Grace and the others were downed and a lot of mods are inactive so, a new group is needed.Nice to see you around here dude!

>but am I wrong? Probably not. This is definitely a last ditch. But it‚Äôs a stand at least and not a roll over and accept it

Every once and a while I go somewhere and drill to find out what I need to understand geology better. Then one day the drilling company shows up at my house and starts drilling a bunch of holes in my front yard. I have to explain that I‚Äôm interested in drilling but I‚Äôm not a driller myself and I certainly don‚Äôt want someone to come to my home and ruin it by drilling a bunch of holes. It‚Äôs not appropriate and it shouldn‚Äôt be legal. Mods - you should be on my side, not theirs.Shouldn't the analogy be that people invaded not your home, but the third-party location where you also go to dig?

>In short, we have political forces hijacking our discussions in order to achieve immediate short term results in the non-conspiracy world of partisan politics.Exactly this. Hope we can find a solution, or at least a way to mitigate it.

Yes!And FTR I consider myself to be somewhat of a political atheist despite *incessant* claims to the contrary.

>That would be us. How we do it is still on the table. Can we do it? Of course we can.Yeah, we take them out with a class action labor lawsuit.  

I disagree. First, backing down and running from such a well known conspiracy forum sends the wrong message. Second, if we did successfully move to a new platform we would face the same obstacles we have already.EDIT: Third, from everything I can sense about the weird recent changes in the sub, it is likely that the power structure wants this sub gone, broken, crippled, not to come back and fix itself in an honest effort to remain who we authentically are - conspiracy theorists.

> The whole reason for this round table was to get the mods to own up as to why the sub has changed so drastically - to the point where real conspiracy theorists cannot find a decent discussion amongst all the imported background noise.Why do you think the mods are responsible for this?Why do you think the mods have control over this?>I think the most productive move would be to ask all mods to voluntarily step aside to assure the regular users that they are not being played or manipulated by insiders who would like this sub to self destruct.With all due respect, that's quite the leap to make.This sub would be nuked by the admins in an instant without a dedicated team of mods to make sure content here strictly adheres to the rules of reddit.At the very least we need *additions* to the current team.

I think the vote count hiding is either a Reddit thing, or at the least, a sub-specific setting. IIRC, a sub can set the amount of time votes are hidden for (or it just defaults to an hour or something).

>Many would like to see rule 10 removed, so that we can have an open discussion on shills.I was always under the impression that we were allowed to do this as long it was an actual detailed post that points out facts and isn't just someone calling another user a shill because they disagree. I've seen several comments and posts over the years where someone will point out an account that only posts from one domain, or has a history that matches up with a bunch of banned accounts, or stuff like that. I guess now might be a good time to get the mods to weigh in on this. 

Shills are a real challenge. It‚Äôs like keeping troublemakers out of a public street party. They have to get really obnoxious before anyone can try to eject them.One shill aspect is that often they come not to discuss conspiracy but to deny it even exists. Ok - we know some conspiracies are on the edge - but why would someone go to the trouble to come to the sub just to deny something most ordinary people don‚Äôt even know much about. Those are the ones I think have to be on a payroll. But again how do you control that?

https://snew.github.io/r/conspiracy/about/logIt's on the sidebar. Look for "r/conspiracy mod log" 

Why even ask? If the mod running this roundtable isn't the worst offender, he's certainly the most transparent and prolific. The haircut's troll army of propagandists and shuteyes infested this sub and now call those of us who point out their bullshit "shills."  Our sub has been weaponized, and not by Soros or CTR. I'd like to see it saved, but expect instead to watch its users march lockstep wherever the orange pied Piper leads them.

Meta just means we are discussing the subreddit as a whole not a single conspiracy such as 9-11This one refers to the discussion itselfBoth of these are reflexive wordings

They will be unbanned when thet retract the threat they made against a redditor.

>The application would also weed out racists.And here is where you go off topic.  Weeding out racists requires someone to define what type of comments are motivated by racism and which ones are acceptable.  This is why you can talk shit about white people on Twitter with the most vile racist language imaginable and get away with it but one comment about planet of the apes taken out of context will get you banned.When will people learn that hate speech and free speech can't both exist at the same time?>Acceptance that politics is nothing more than the entertainment wing of the shadow government is necessaryHow do you suggest that democracies advertise people who want to run for elected office?  Politics is a necessary function of democracy.

I like the idea of tags and would love to see them. Sure everything can boil down to certain things like politics. But the people that take time to bitch about an occasional (assuming occasional otherwise poster may be trill) reptilian post mark politics is either bored or an asshole. No system implemented will be full proof and there will be detractors regardless. But the tags will solve a lot of the gripes I hear about this sub. I personally won‚Äôt care and laugh at all the people on a counter culture sub not getting along etc and getting serious about it. That sort of stuff is the nature of us, we are always skeptical so duh we dont get along.

Maybe a time/date limit? Like 1-2 years back gets thrown into politics and the rest is ok? I'm just spitballing here.

Sounds like that old right wing line.. "if you don't like freedom leave the country."

 

 

That's it then. Rename the sub to r/PractitionersOfModernWitchcraft

>Also, voting on mods would just guarantee that we end up with shills for mods, since the shills, bots & brigaders have made it clear that they can always outvote us by a huge margin if they want to.Just throwing an idea out there, but you could just have public voting. Don't base it on upvotes and downvotes, but by public comments. Every vote is directly tied to a username. Then you either use automod or some other tool to ignore new accounts, accounts that have never posted here before, or whatever other system you can come up with. It'd be pretty hard to manipulate that except for someone who has a bunch of well-used alt accounts standing by.

Rather than just a straight vote, mount evidence upon evidence of poor decisions from the mod log. If there's countless examples of a mod approving, banning etc inappropriately then they should be questioned.Can't provide a sufficient answer? Get out. That way there's a clear reason for their removal rather than just 51 votes VS 49 or whatever. If the evidence is compelling I'm sure most regular users would see reason.  

Likely because they're a member of /r/conspiracy_conclave. A private sub dedicated to deciding how to run this one. Yes, banned users are tasked with aiding in the decision making behind running this sub. 

> I'd like to expand on this and ask why some users are given so much more leeway than others? My favorite example is /u/rmfn Here are the subs that Ambiguous modshttps://imgur.com/QXM7S1MAnd the subs that rmfn mods https://imgur.com/rfS3NmiI have no horse in this race but I have seen many people here get away with shit that others are insta banned permanently for. One of the primary reasons is they are all buddy buddy, many mods work multiple subs which does 2 things. Gives friends free passes and lowers their ability to be active in a large sub conspiracy when you have a dozen subs to keep an eye on. 

>why some users are given so much more leeway than others?I can only speak for myself on this issue, but every person is different, so for me it really is on a case by case basis.For the most part, I consider two different factors:1. Are they a conspiracy theorist?2. Do they have a history of posting original/quality content on /r/conspiracy?The second one is a bit easier, especially because original content is one of the many things I think makes this sub great. We all can get emotional and lose our cool, so it stands to reason that those who have a consistent track record of positive contributions to the sub should be given more chances than those that don't.As for the notion of "giving preference" to conspiracy theorists, I recognize that might be considered controversial. This does *not* mean that skeptics and debunkers aren't welcome here, quite the contrary, as the conspiracy community *needs* these individuals to keep us grounded and focused. It truly is a team effort.However, diehard debunkers who *also* break the rules are not treated with as much sympathy as diehard conspiracy theorists who do the same.Yes, in some instances this may have all the appearances of impartiality. But the way I see it, the *vast* majority of reddit is a "safe space" to essentially demean and belittle conspiracies (as was the intention of the CIA in popularizing the term in the first place).Ironically, this targeted demonization of the mere *consideration* of conspiracy theories is one of this sub's greatest defenses, since pretty much every thing that gets discussed here can be dismissed as mere "conspiracy" theory, which in many ways can be quite liberating.I hope this addresses some of your concerns!

It depends on how drunk they are at the time.

Axol seems to be the voice of reason for mods out of control. 

Doesn't seem to violate any sidebar rules.Does it?

Im way too lazy for that but going forward I will. So please explain how conspiracy gets around this term and condition? How does this sub give redditors the chance to change or remove their comments while at the same time providing a resource to look up deleted or removed comments? You see the problem here right?

I'd like to add to your write up one other weird piece of evidence. As we've not gotten an official response from the mods about Aleister.... [this image](https://i.imgur.com/3RWCsPU.jpg) was included in a post over at top minds in the immediate aftermath of the Aleister removal. There is no confirmation of it being legit so far, but it fits the little pieces mods have unofficially dropped.If I follow correctly, the only way to have the ability to make that image, is as a mod of this subreddit, or an Admin. Its disturbing and raises a lot of questions I had hoped a mod would have an official response about.

u/IntellisaurDinoAlien deleted his account after u/Aleister replied to himself in modmail, leading to suspicions that he was another mod's alt. Or rather, he leaked the modmail where Aleister did it to TMoR and then deleted his account because he was frustrated that nobody was concerned about the possibility that a bunch of the /conspiracy mod accounts are run by one guy. The official statement by the mod team was that Aleistsr was drunk and made a mistake (fair enough), but they've since tried to retcon it as some sort of sting operation.But yeah, the mod vetting process here doesn't seem to be very succesful.

You've said it. Personally I would do it myself, but I don't want to get involved in modding just yet since I want to improve my skills first. Although I would like to measure myself in mod elections if they eventually happen!

 

To clarify, the SS is meant to demonstrate why OP thinks the post is suitable for /r/conspiracy.However, *there is no stated requirement that every single post has to have a uniquely identifiable and universally agreed upon conspiracy*.The logistics of enforcing such arbitrary and subjective conditions on the entire sub would cripple the mod team and devolve a good portion of the discussions into debates over whether a post is a "conspiracy theory" or not.The guidelines on the sidebar are a great place to start:>This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public‚Äôs imagination. Please respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind. Our goals are a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone.Try to keep this in mind: *This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues.* Censoring content based on whether or not something can be unanimously identified as a "conspiracy" (a nebulous concept) would be entirety antithetical to everything this sub stands for.

So would it be impossible for a mod to add a very brief ‚Äúmod-stamp‚Äù basically agreeing that the post has an acceptable conspiracy as its focus?Also we need to shut down the repeats - we have 50 pipe bomb posts - that‚Äôs ridiculous and highly counterproductive imho

Just sticking my nose in to repeat my theory that two very different conversations are happening here:1. There is a prepackaged and mod-approved discussion about how mods treat individual problem-users. This is essentially a question of reddiquette - most users ignore or downvote or move on from these encounters if they feel uncomfortable.2. There is a much more complex discussion that has to do with how mods might or ought to exercise whatever powers are at their disposal to return the sub to a state of balanced open minded discussion between redditors who genuinely want to talk about conspiracy theory. I can‚Äôt determine why the first dominates and the second goes unaddressed.

That's the only way I can see this sub moving forward. Have the no meta rule and one meta thread per day/week for shit slinging. 

What about alts that are other mods? 

>This sub has been a joke since the election. And it warrants the ostracism it receives.>Then why are you here?Because i enjoyed the sub immensely prior to the extreme shift to one side of the political spectrum. Is there a rule prohibiting me from being here? Do i have to agree with the group think of one side of the other in order to participate here? There are clearly issues that users are commenting on and doing so in good faith. Why post a round table thread if there is no intent to discuss things?Im commenting in the hopes that just maybe there may be some modifications to the current status quo here as users make their feelings known, yet again.*the TOR node connection seems to be extremely interesting considering the sheer number of people who use reddit in a similar fashion and have never had an issue. A_P was suspended for multiple days, if memory serves at least 4 or 5 days, possibly more. Thats not a TOR issue, admins dont care about using TOR on the site, they do care about people vote manipulating running multiple accounts, doxxing, etc. 

Don't be such a scaredy cat.  There's strength in social capital.

Denver

Not disagreeing...but there's a dynamic in play that pretty much dictates how this is going to go.One group has to follow the rules...and one group doesn't...and this is enforced by the admins of reddit..it's not some whacked out conspiracy theory. It's a fact.And the interpretation of those rules is constantly being adjusted to favor the group that doesn't have to follow the rules.

True enough! If you joined a geology club and the drillers ruined it, would that be ok either?

Icy?I have nothing to be icy about.  I've won and won and just when I thought I was about to lose the American people who had lost my confidence for being so easily manipulated proved me wrong.  The sun came up and they flat rejected the political hit jobs and now fake ass mail bombs.  Shit that just 4 or 5 years ago they would have guzzled down without question.The difference with the pendulum swing on this pass is that the MSM and deep state failed to secure control of the swing so they jumped off the ride.Look at us, we're the captain now.We can hear it coming. The low rumble growing in the bowels of the Patriots, we're about to take a huge shit on your parade.Enjoy.

Thank you very much for the honest answer to my questions. They were both more than expected and less than what is needed in this discussion:Do mods and those who influence and consult with them intentionally shape discussions where critical decisions or information are at stake?If any other players of any disposition chose to do that using such methods, would the mods be able to detect that manipulation and would they intervene to halt it?

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:- [/r/topmindsofreddit] [Toppest of Mods r\/Antacid\_Painintheass (getting closer every time) claims to be a ‚Äúpolitical atheist‚Äù which is an odd way to say Russian Shill](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/9rp0va/toppest_of_mods_rantacid_painintheass_getting/)&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*

Being considered an employee would mean you'd be held to a higher standard for your moderation.Can't have employed mods banning inappropriately.You sure you want that? 

I was thinking more along the lines of new rules/new mods/new coexisting website. But good luck with that legal attack.

Im not advocating "backing down and running" I think the part were I said how millions of positive things have rippled through humanity because of reddit shows that. The problem is corporate influence/intelligence agency acronyms/private entities/trolls manipulating reddit and more specificly /r/conspiracy . The solution is not a simple one. I agree a new platform would face the same problems. The idea is they already own and control this one. Better to start fresh. And by no means do I want the new platform to overthrow reddit or /r/conspiracy the internet is big enough for them to coexist.

>Why are mods responsible or in control?Mods are the first line of defense - they do not make the problems but they are the ‚Äúgraspable mediators‚Äù between users and those problems and their true source. It feels like we‚Äôre grasping at straws.> due respectRespect is earned. You have earned a great deal of it with your vast patience, insight and acumen.

Dude, YOU posted that this was a false flag well before there was information and stickied it. You're kidding, right?

This is the problem exactly. Organic users will be discussing a conspiracy -- and not everyone necessarily believing it, but folks honestly, openly discussing the evidence and possible explanations -- and then a bunch of other folks come along and say, nope, not a conspiracy, debunked, etc. Any attempt to discuss factthat they won't even acknowledge a conspiracy theory is a *possibility* or that their comments and downvote patterns appear inorganic, is met with the retort that "why is anyone who disagrees with you automatically a shill?" This happens very frequently on certain topics. On a conspiracy forum, I have no problem with people saying "I'm not convinced" or "I'm skeptical" but this obvious, repeated pattern of complete denial followed by mass downvotes and whining about shill accusations needs to be dealt with. 

Thanks. I hope you will carry one with /r/conspiracy. Just plug the holes...

Regarding your first point, I think if people want 100% unfiltered discussion they are free to go to VOAT. I would prefer curated content here to maximize waking people up. I think it's easy to set logical lines. For example, you can say Zionism is bad, but you can't say judiasm is bad. Regarding the second point, I am a little confused. Do you believe we live in a democracy?

Do you mean have it be optional?

We don't have to even get along but we don't have to be shitty to each other either.Fingers crossed*

We'll do the best we can.

x,y are points in time for users A and B respectively. Linear regression and reporting of R^2 would be great. Then do this for all combinations of users and report where R^2 is > 0.75. As I write this, it sounds like a lot of work.

> Probably for editing their comments after being banned or for spamming.This was definitely the case for DwarvesAreForCuddles. I think I remember poor Celine having to go through and spend a solid chunk of time removing all of their posts. (There were a LOT.)

 

How does one get perma banned multiple times?

>*modlogs*can't unthink.

Ok you convinced me.How to navigate the system to bring this measure into reality - will support.

>How do I allow users to see the mod log? I'm probably the worst mod on the team to ask.  You may want to hit up mod mail with that question, and mention I said so.  Have a good one!

This is actually a great idea.

Exactly. How many times have you been banned and reinstated? Five? 

That's definitely part of it, but there is more to it than that. I used to whine about the conclave a lot so one of the mods ended up adding me as a member. The sub is dead. There are hardly any new posts there and even when there are the mods usually don't respond to anything. I agree that there seems to be a bit of a "Good ol boys" club, but the conclave is a very, very small part of it. 

Aren't you in the conclave? We invite you.

You just sound butthurt because you have been shitting where we eat all these years, and they picked PLC over you to represent the trollish contingent of regulars.

He's one of the specific ones I was thinking of, but I didn't want to name any names. There were some leaked screenshots from the conclave back around the time the new mods were added where he outright admitted to intentionally trolling and trying to break the rules in clever ways (like calling someone "rabbi" instead of "jew", or saying "brrr it's chilly" instead of "shill").There are a few other users as well, including one who also moderates a lot of the same subs as mods here. He even tried to become a mod here but had a temper tantrum when he didn't get it. I believe that's what got him banned, but he was just recently unbanned. If he ends up getting added as a mod now that there are openings, we'll know why. 

I see CelineHagbard cross moderates a lot of those too, interesting.

Thanks for the response! I think your reasons are fine, I just have the feeling that we might disagree on who those descriptions apply to. There are some users who seem to spend more time trolling than posting (or debunking) conspiracies. The kind of users who intentionally post controversial topics just to bait people into arguing with them. The kind of users who will post borderline racist comments one day and then go around accusing everyone else of being racists the next day, just to stir up drama. 

How much ass kissing is required to get unbanned? Is it a lot or a whole lot?

We know people commit crimes. We know people have friends and allies. Yet saying people planned crimes in secret is somehow impossible. That's the level of cognitive dissonance in this country, a criminal charge you could literally go to jail for is considered fantasy. The idea that anyone in power would abuse that power is paranoia? I don't think so.

Interesting. Thanks for being honest 

Lol

Rule 5. 

>Im way too lazy for that but going forward I will. They are all removed now. >So please explain how conspiracy gets around this term and condition? As far as this goes - the modlog just shows a comment was approved/removed. It doesn't link their username to anything.>How does this sub give redditors the chance to change or remove their comments while at the same time providing a resource to look up deleted or removed comments? How does any subreddit?>You see the problem here right?Not really.

>As we've not gotten an official responseIt's my understanding that we're still waiting for some clarification from the admins before making an "official" announcement.Perhaps someone else on the team with a better sense of the timeline can chime in here, but it's my understanding that aleister approved a post that linked to an image that contained Blasey Ford's address, as stated in the screenshotted message.FTR, doxxing is not even remotely tolerated on /r/conspiracy and we take this issue *very* seriously. At the time, aleister was doing the lion's share of the moderation duties, and tbh I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt that of the hundreds of posts he was moderating on a daily basis that he approved this one by mistake.As it was, to my knowledge, his first infraction, I did petition the admins to restore his account with a warning, but as the severity of this issue is indisputable, I won't be holding my breath, and I certainly don't fault the admins for not budging.Ultimately, as this sub continues to grow, we're going to need to bulk up the mod team so we can make sure every post and comment here follow the sub's--and reddit's--rules.

[removed]

I'd say pretty good, considering we offer a modlog of all of our actions.  Could you imagine if a sub this large, with groups who are out to get it, offered the same?

Thanks for the clarification! I've always thought the following justified the need for a statement in regards to *why* it belongs in the conspiracy sub:>Should explain or elaborate on why the link is being posted to /r/conspiracy and why the userbase should care about it.Regardless, it's helpful to have a mod chime in!

Thanks! So let me repeat back what I‚Äôm picking up:The SS forces the OP to justify the content of their post as suitable for conspiracyThe mod is tasked with ensuring each post has a SSHowever, while checking the SS the mod cannot undertake the additional ‚Äúsuitability‚Äù that the post is about a reasonably valid conspiracy bacause1. It would be too onerous,And 2. It might interfere with free thinking Do I have it right?

Regarding 2 - I agree it is very complex.I'm hoping when this thread is done we rework all the Rules on the sidebar, elminate some and consolidate some others.

I think the [Meta] theads will eventually consolidate themselves and their frequency will dip over time (but should always be available).And this way users can toggle to hide those so only those who care will see them - improving the page for those users immediately.

What? Probably a fail safe.

Ah so that explains the downvotes!

>Being considered an employee would mean you'd be held to a higher standard for your moderation.>Can't have employed mods banning inappropriately.Yeah, it probably would be a good idea.  It would be nice to know someone who held power over my actions at least had some kind of background check... >You sure you want that? Haha, this isn't about what I want.  It's literally the federal labor laws they are in violation of.  I didn't make the laws, nor did I create reddit's business model.

Out of curiosity, are you a libertarian?

I still believe there is a special middle road that goes through the sub. We are negotiating the unwinding of our parents and grandparents secrets and mistakes, like jfk and Vietnam, and gwb and ghwb and their wars. It‚Äôs not about mere politics, it‚Äôs a way of penance and respect as well as fully informing the next generation

> It feels like we‚Äôre grasping at straws.I don't blame you. Honestly, the mod team has very similar frustrations with respect to our relationship with the admins.Sometimes they are there when we *really* need them...and, well, sometimes they very noticeably aren't.Again, I don't fault them, as I'm sure they have a monstrously difficult job, but it often leaves us high and dry and as a result much of the discontent gets directed at *us* when TBH it should be directed up the food chain.>why are you lending your talents to the manipulations and deceptions all of us can sense in the very bits being exchanged here?That's a really good question that I've been struggling with for quite a number of years now.One of the things that *got* me elected mod in the first place was my dedication to producing original content solely for the benefit of /r/conspiracy. I'm really proud of some of the material I've put together over the last decade or so.However, when I became mod, I found myself occupied with moderation duties much more resulting in less time for this research.You're right...I should lead by example.As an aside, I'm finally putting the finishing touches on the next installment in my "research" and I should be posting it soon! (Spoiler Alert: It concerns a mysterious prisoner and an even more mysterious flight during WWII)>If the admins did that then a new and healthier branch of this tree would be able to reconstitute quickly.

Why can't I say Judaism is bad when people say Christianity is bad and Islam is bad?We live in a democratic republic.  On the state level it's a representative direct democracy (for most states) and on the federal level it's a republic.

 

Great idea.

Ups, looks like he knew too much.

 

 

Maybe think of "permanent" as "indefinite". Bans can be appealed and overturned. 

[removed]

But what about the person with the well-used alts? 

Two temp bans. First mod that banned me got removed. 

I'm sure 4 of those are for arguing with a certain someone who likes to brag about his bans.Which is like bragging about getting detentions. "Wow, it's so cool you can't follow rules..."

orrr, like most other big sub mods, they have a discord channel they set up

No. Someone's been telling you fibs. 

I like reading the leaks. I would love to read the whole thing. 

[removed]

Yup, you've fairly accurately summarized the general clusterfuck that is moderating a sub like /r/conspiracy =D

How is it stalking or trolling?

>As far as this goes - the modlog just shows a comment was approved/removed. It doesn't link their username to anything.Are you saying the mod log doesn't show the name of the user who had their comment removed/approved/etc? It does name the commenter and the mod who took the action.

>Ultimately, as this sub continues to grow, we're going to need to bulk up the mod team so we can make sure every post and comment here follow the sub's--and reddit's--rules.Will new mods be chosen by the larger sub or will they also be chosen in conspiracy_conclave like the last group? Will the nomination/selection process be transparent, or will it all take place in a private sub again?

Thanks! I feel that would be/would have been a great response to issue to the community. ---Since my observation seems to keep getting sidestepped I'll ask my question directly:Is it possible there is a mod in conspiracy who is passing nonpublic information on to the users at top minds? I ask because the screenshot I posted in a earlier reply seems to imply that they have screenshots from a mod/admin thread. Is there another way for that info to be revealed? 

>Indicating that you‚Äôve visited TopMinds is enough to be banned here. I don't agree based on personal experience. 

 

Since I think  you are the only mod in this thread so far could you comment about how you ensure the mods who work here are held accountable for approves, removes, bans mutes etc?I posted several links to your mod log, which is wonderful, showing more than a few abuses. How does this sub handle a mod who is acting out or not performing their duties correctly?

>The SS forces the OP to justify the content of their post as suitable for conspiracyYes, but it also eliminates posts from bots, spam and low-effort content from those with minimal interest in the sub.>The mod is tasked with ensuring each post has a SSWe have a bot that removes the thread if OP doesn't post a comment after 20 minutes.When folks abuse the SS it almost always gets reported by the users, and at that point the mods can deal with it directly.In these instances, the mods can use their own judgment to determine whether or not OP is posting in good faith.If the SS is simply something like: "this is fascinating, check it out!!" I will issue a warning to that user, explain the purpose of the SS, and usually that's that.It really just needs to give a respectable summary of the content being presented to the community.At most the SS is an inconvenient extra step to help ensure the "humanity" and integrity of OP.

LMAO how is that acceptable?Imagine that, a 3 mod consensus where all 3 mods are the same person. 

> 240 comments so far with 4 mods that I saw. Seems to be a solid discussion.there have been similar discussions in the past and nothing changed. I wont hold my breath on this resulting in anything meaningful either.I wont hold

That's the problem with your platform, you guys think you can define what everyone is actually saying.Trump says he's a nationalist and the MSM says he really meant "white nationalist".Nobody gives a shit about your ftfy nonsense anymore.  Obviously my original message wasn't intended for you although you're welcome to join minds.com and gab.ai, they won't ban you for being a leftist.  But we all know that you'll be more comfortable where the information monitors roam the halls mopping away all the wrong think and banning all the conservatives, nationalist and Patriots.

How indeed.With your conspiratards and your c_s_ts and tmors and conclaves, your offshores in chans and voats ... your corporate masters and political thralldomsThis web is a veritable model of a digital instance of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny - spook theorists mimicking spook realities in the relative safety of a new cyber-universe where we are the known unknowns.

 

Not really.I don't like being shoed into labels because then people will assume you carry ALL the traits. I like some bits. 

Assuredly that sardonic jab was meant as a high compliment 

I get what you are saying. The context of this specific view is that we are already post-freespeech in this forum because of manipulation from TMOR and other groups. It is close to impossible in this forums current state for quality posts to get a spotlight. That is why I would shift into curated content. The goal would not be to respect everyone's view but to promote the most thorough, informative content.Now, I admit this is all a little egocentric because I consider myself to be a top theorist globally and think I would be able to shift this forum into being the premier and best organized truth repository on the net, and wouldn't really trust anyone else to do it (that being said, shout-out to our top mods whom i support).So to respond to your specific inquiry I would say, you can criticize religion in general. But if someone is constantly criticising judiasm but not the jesuits, for example, then I would call them out on having an incomplete worldview and tell them to inform themselves more.

Yes - if implemented you would be able to filter out certain topics (or only see them) I think.If it can be done - I would want it this way for sure.

Oh good catch. And sidenote, I really do find your analyses fascinating. Thanks for sticking around and giving insight into this stuff!

Glad to hear it!  

I get a tattoo to remember each one. 

Yeah, I figured they probably have one. Seems most subs do.

Did you ever ask to be invited? 

So I went digging thru my old saved links and I found the archive of when he admitted to trying to break the rules.https://archive.is/A84E2The relevant quote from about halfway down the page:>What compelled me to return to con was flytapes constant bitching about how dead it was. When I was "trolling" I was experimenting with the limits of this now unfamiliar sub. After a long thread in the inside many months ago I got the idea to attack rule ten. I went around posting very controversial subjects, the main one being that the Nazi Party was inspired by left wing totalitarianism. When tmor instantly attacked the posts i was able to label the attackers tmor, or chilly, or any other veiled name for shill. I wanted to protest rule ten by going around it. Needless to say a nameless mod really didn't like this. So hammer. I think the ban your talking about was from a thread about the health risks of anal sex, someone posted that they had their girlfriend on a leash or something like that. And I said something like have fun when she leaves you for Tyrone. Which was meant to be a joke but admittedly in bad taste. Everyone's personal fetish is their business. God knows we all have them..>I think humor is the most important weapon in breaking down cognitive dissonance. Many of my posts are (yes I tell myself this) a complex form of satire that my post, Confessions of a Monarchist Pagan, outline. To some my humor may be trolling, but to me conspiracy would be dead if we couldn't have a laugh.

Unfortunately, your comment contains images that violate reddit's [TOS](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-may-25-2018).>Intentionally negate any user's actions to delete or edit their Content on the Services; orIt will be reinstated when you scratch out the usernames.

Why do you want users calling each other delusional? I thought we werent supposed to call each other names? Check the mod log people get removed for name calling constantly. 

But not their content.

Maybe the mods can do an open enrollment period where people can request admittance to the conclave and be vetted. Then the election can be held there without bot, shill and brigade interference. Voter registration as it were. 

/u/Th3_Admiral has a [nice suggestion](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9rb012/rconspiracy_round_table_18_the_past_present/e8fv55q/):>You could just have public voting. Don't base it on upvotes and downvotes, but by public comments. Every vote is directly tied to a username. >Then you either use automod or some other tool to ignore new accounts, accounts that have never posted here before, or whatever other system you can come up with. >It'd be pretty hard to manipulate that except for someone who has a bunch of well-used alt accounts standing by.

>Is it possible there is a mod in conspiracy who is passing nonpublic information on to the users at top minds?From my understanding, a mod shared the screenshot with the "conclave" sub and it leaked from there. It's long been known that someone in the conclave leaks to TMOR, so nothing truly sensitive is shared there anyway.I wasn't personally involved in any of that so I can't really say much more.

[removed]

HAHA, I see! You might want to buy a lottery ticket.... Damn, a couple days late!

It sends you a private message saying to was removed.

>could you comment about how you ensure the mods who work here are held accountable for approves, removes, bans mutes etc?Sure!  I personally don't feel it's my responsibility as an individual to explain other mods actions.  I may disagree with some of them, and even offer my point of view in mod mail.  But that doesn't mean I can explain their personal point of view on their actions.  With that said, the issue isn't with the mods per say, but the way Reddit has structured how they allow mods to manage users content.  It's been an issue since day one and have personally spoken out against it.  >How does this sub handle a mod who is acting out or **not performing their duties correctly**?And this is the question that brought me to realize reddit is out of compliance with federal and state labor laws.  Reddit, as a for-profit company, enlists "Volenteers" (according to them) to manage the subs.  This creates the issue, since if you look at the laws for Volenteers, non-profits are limited to how they can manage the people who volunteer for them... reddit is in a gray area, since they are breaking the law and no one has called them on their bullshit... yet.

Thank you for your patience and the steady way you work and explain. It will not help my urge to reclaim a subreddit I remember when nearly every post was interesting and topical, I know

Most subs arent exactly democracy's. 

Can you back *any* if the things you said above?

"information monitors roam the halls mopping away all the wrong think and banning..."You mean like they do over at r/thedonald?  Hypocrite much?

So do you think going one going all means tossing the women and children and the stokers and the stewards off the deck? We all count. That‚Äôs the human position.

>With your conspiratards and your c_s_ts and tmors and conclaves, your offshores in chans and voats ... your corporate masters and political thralldomsI don't chan or voat and don't really conclave. What you see is what you get.>This web is a veritable model of a digital instance of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny - spook theorists mimicking spook realities in the relative safety of a new cyber-universe where we are the known unknowns.I'm sure some movements or groups have congealed in the places you mention and are organizing. At this point I am of the belief that they use /r/conspiracy as a battleground of sorts and we are all spectators (and sometimes the focus of the Show, unfortunately).

Nope, it was another one, where they tried to misconstrue what I said.

>don't tag my nameI won't anymore, but I hope you recognize I couldn't give a fuck less at this point.  

So you have a minimum of 5 tattoos

You just said you invited me... 

*thanks for being the adult in this conversation.

We really don't need any more bullshitters and cruel trolling remarks on here, so good riddance (hopefully)

Not creepy at all that you have a "file" dedicated to my wrong think.

So that means you'd need to consider banning all archive links. As they are likely to contain content that has since been edited or deleted. And you'd need to remove the mod log as that now is hosting the content which you removed for TOS violations.

Check the mod log people get removed for name calling constantly. That comment specifically did not.

Are we talking about the mod log in general? I'm referring to what we, as users, can see when we open the mod log link. You can see the user, the content of the comment/post, and the mod that took the action.

> where people can request admittance to the conclave and be vetted.This is basically already the process for anyone who wants to join the conclave and as far as I understand it, the second to last wave of moderators was done exactly like this but public even (done on this sub and not a private one).

Pretty much anyone who asks is let in. They make such a big deal out of nothing.  

>It'd be pretty hard to manipulate that except for someone who has a bunch of well-used alt accounts standing by.Like when the sub announced the implementation of the minimum age account rule to participate and suddenly multiple perfectly aged accounts appeared within the following day?or how we have that rule but certain sub mods will manually approve account posts/comments for accounts that are below the threshold?

You are ban evading?

 

>With that said, the issue isn't with the mods per say, but the way Reddit has structured how they allow mods to manage users content.So as of right now there is no accountability once a person has been granted mod status? They can basically run wild?Lets say you have a mod who is ban happy and dramatically overstepping their duties at what point do the other mods step in, how does that process work and have you ever seen it in action? >This creates the issue, since if you look at the laws for Volenteers, non-profits are limited to how they can manage the people who volunteer for them... reddit is in a gray area, since they are breaking the law and no one has called them on their bullshit... yet.I would actually be curious to see this as its own post. 

>my urge to reclaim a subreddit I remember when nearly every post was interesting and topicalIt seems to me that you are more longing for a different era of the *internet* than /r/conspiracy. There is a literal generational shift occurring before our very eyes, and it's had a noticeable impact on the content and atmosphere of reddit as a whole, and it's been quite the ride, as you clearly can attest to.The clickbaitization of the internet (and real life!) started to take its worst toll on /r/conspiracy around this time last year. If you recall, the sub was flooded with absolute drivel, and it was relentless. tbh, although the mod team had some reservations about being overly restrictive, the eventual implementation of the submission statement and the minimum 2-month requirement for accounts has significantly cleaned up the board, and I actually feel like we're closer than ever to the feel of /r/conspiracy from around 5 or 6 years ago.Granted, there's much more political content, but that's largely due to how many political conspiracy theories have now gone mainstream.

Well youre a mod...

Like you do following me all over Reddit downvoting and complaining about my opinions.Seriously everyone look at this guys comment history. Everywhere I comment on Reddit Zir shows up and whines about whatever I'm saying.  This is why Reddit will die, fucking opinion management teams like this correcting the record.

Yes we all count, that's the human position.  I agree 100%.This is exactly why venues like Reddit and YouTube are dying.  That's why I said what I said above.  You you care about fairness and everyone counting then there are better venues that aren't hell bent on deplatforming conservatives, blaming white people for everything and using collective punishment to gloss over certain people's civil rights.3 or 4 years ago, before the left needed the Russia conspiracy to explain away their unpopularity, that was /conspiracy on Reddit.  Conspiracy was constantly being collectively punished, the butt of every joke.  Even the admins mocked us openly but now you can honestly have this place.  We used it for many years to spread the truth and we have turned the culture war in our favor.  Nobody trusts the FBI, CIA or MSM.  And that's how it should be since these three letter agencies decided to use their various powers to prop up the ruling elites instead serving the people.  There is only so much you can lie to people before they look at your latest bomb hoax story and change the channel without even considering it.  "By any means necessary" they said...  And we answered "actually, go fuck yourselves.". And we changed the channel.  No need to reply with another subject change like you just attempted, I said my piece in the original comment I made here and I have no obligation to answer a stack of loaded questions.

 

What rule did that break?

Banning is an act of "giving a fuck".So no more bans? :D

I can't invite. I'm not a mod.

Not a file, it's in my saved comments on Reddit along with a few other things I refer back to occasionally. Like the "persona non grata" list you guys put together a [while back](https://ibb.co/fApBcx). Now that I'm looking at it again, I notice that /u/f_k_a_g_n even made it on that list, which is really shocking. That's the user who has provided a lot of really good analysis on suspicious accounts, posting histories, and stuff like that.Edit: Here's the actual comment I had saved in case you are curious. It's from the announcement thread for the new mods.https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/841qs8/announcing_the_newest_members_of_the_rconspiracy/dvmtdky?context=1

Creepier even more that you comment to yourselves when you‚Äôre the same person.Can I get banned for that? Even if my guess is true?

And if they ever want to edit or delete them, they can.The **content** of their *comment* is what we are talking about.

> Your unredacted screenshots each violate this and can jeapordize your account as well as the Subreddit as a whole.So let me get this straight, making reference of the modlog violates the terms of service for reddit as a whole? I am not allowed to reference the mod log on reddit itself? >One hour should be enough time. If they remain as is any comments by you in this thread in a similar manner will be removed.So you are going to remove all of my comments in this thread? 

[removed]

If you take a screenshot of a user's content,  and the name is not redacted, it violates reddit's TOS.

What happened  to your biscotti?

> Pretty much anyone who asks is let inNot true. At the very least, you have to have an established record of participation in /r/conspiracy.

Which is one of the reasons (IMO), *it's a failed idea, now*. People should have to earn their way in (via contributions over time), and that was case the for the original approved submitters. And, just so people know, no... I'm no longer a member there, nor have I for a while.

>Like when the sub announced the implementation of the minimum age account rule to participate and suddenly multiple perfectly aged accounts appeared within the following day?I'm actually not quite sure I follow...From the mod's perspectives, when we established the two month rule it was *two months* later that we all of the sudden had to deal with an influx of 2-month old accounts.Since then, things have pretty much leveled out.I think this minimum account age requirement has done wonders to clean this place up.

In that case, I hope you're that winner from NC!

>I would actually be curious to see this as its own post.https://saidit.net/s/SaidIt/comments/4hn/could_reddit_moderators_be_considered_employees/You can also follow this TMOR thread, it's pretty funny.https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/9ojgad/the_mod_team_in_rconspiracy_continues_to_be_a/e7uj4u1/

Again, and as always, you make perfect sense.But only in respect to ‚Äútrends‚Äù and ‚Äúaudience‚Äù. You must see that much much less conspiracy is being discussed than in years past. And the younger users are being encouraged in their ignorance to start from scratch rather than educating themselves.New eyes and more clicks - is that really the underlying goal? Are we monetizing this damn thing called conspiracy, or are we fighting for our country and our planet to survive as a place we would want for the futures we see coming at us?

And you're late.

Dude, relax, don't get hysterical.  This is a public forum.  You are free to post your opinions, and I am free to call out your bullshit and hypocracy. If you can't handle heat, you can always go back to r/thedonald where the thought police roam the halls banning everyone who doesn't tow the fascist line worshiping the "GEOTUS".

That's the comment! And if I was trying to end the dispute I would have perm banned them an deleted the comments.  I don't appreciate anyone taking one comment out of context to smear me, you or any other user.  And it was a slap on the wrist frankly.  factyou are even taking issue with it is surprising.

Pointing out contradictions is naughty. 

Rule 5... And if you want to go there, rule 10.

Great question. Read the post for yourself, pointing out contradictions... Very naughty. 

As long as you don't play stupid games! :-)

How misleading. (given you said "WE" invited...) 

Yep. Totally normal.

What do you mean? I'm you pheephee

Unfortunately, your comment contains images that violate reddit's [TOS](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-may-25-2018).Intentionally negate any user's actions to delete or edit their Content on the Services; orYou have been adequately warnes and continue to do this. That is unfortunate.

Can you point out what part of the TOS states this?

I know you think you're being clever (you're not), but Puzzleheaded is just [one of the words used](https://i.imgur.com/ZOXBhWv.png) in Reddit's autogenerated username system.(For those not in the loop, RMFN thinks I'm former user PuzzleheadedBiscotti simply because everyone knows all accounts with the same word in them are owned by the same person.)

[lol.](https://media2.giphy.com/media/qiMbLh4WHEZyw/giphy.gif?cid=3640f6095bd273336352397732e9b0bb)

Is your alt approved for the conclave?

it was not two months later. I reported them when i saw them, sure there was an increased influx later.But you are neglecting to respond about the approval of accounts actions that DONT meet the age requirement.

 

>Are we monetizing this damn thing called conspiracyNot on our watch! I personally think the reason the /r/conspiracy mod team is attacked so frequently is precisely because we've shown that we *can't* be bought.In addition, we are all individuals who have our own unique perspectives and personalities. >You must see that much much less conspiracy is being discussed than in years past. Yes, that's why I've implemented the Round Table feature, as well as the SS which *somewhat* requires OP to stay in the realm of "conspiracy" theory.

Well did anything come out of this round table?Other than mods stickying their own posts to ‚Äútry something new‚Äù to combat ‚Äúbrigading‚Äù?

So why do you follow me around all over Reddit?  Just be honest no need to pretend like you're not doing it intentionally.

 

Did you or did you not ever ask to be let in?You can't get invited into a sub and reject that invitation and go back and talk like you were excluded. It's pretty pathetic honestly. 

Would you care to address the actual quote, or are you more concerned with factI saved a link to it? 

Never mind I must have mistaken you for a different person with the same user name? Do you think that‚Äôs just a coincidence?

I've said it enough times today.

Honestly I think this is just bullshit to keep users from posting screenshots. If you actually cared about that rule you wouldnt link to the mod logJust saying

> Any that have screenshots that violate reddit's TOS - yes.How does this subreddit get around that rule?Since you brought it up... Isnt conspiracy breaking this very rule by linking to deleted comments via the modlog? >Intentionally negate any user's actions to delete or edit their Content on the ServicesHave you run this one by the admins? I only found that log because of the mod team here and their links to it. So please explain how I violate it by posting snippets of what is provided. https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/#section_moderator_guidelines_for_healthy_communities_effective_april_17.2C_2017

I have linked it numerous times in this thread. 

If you're not them and you showed up after they died why do you know about  them?

While not required, you are requested to use the NP (No Participation) domain of reddit when crossposting. This helps to protect both your account, and the accounts of other users, from administrative shadowbans. The NP domain can be accessed by replacing the "www" in your reddit link with "np".*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/conspiracy) if you have any questions or concerns.*

You know 

>But you are neglecting to respond about the approval of accounts actions that DONT meet the age requirement.Which instances are you referring to?When I browse through popular threads on /r/conspiracy, I frequently see and approve comments from newer users, especially if they are constructive.Similarly, I always approve comments from shadowbanned users when I see them, and I then will inform them of their predicament.New users that want to *continue* to post conspiratorial content generally have to "do their time" at /r/conspiracy_commons first.

Thank you!  Out of curiosity, why did my comment/comments make you think of it? No worries if you don't feel like sharing.  Have a good evening!

Nothing yet. It's only been 4 days.What's the rush?

Sport.  

Sure, I agree with one.  Still stand by my 3 day ban.  And if you see someone pull the same shit, let me know.  I couldn't care less about anyones point of view here.  But if you're going to mischaracterize what one user said in order to smear them, then I'll ban that user.  Don't play games! 

I would like to be invited

I was never invited :(Didn't ask, maybe I should? 

Why should I explain myself when everything is all out in the open? You have already laid out your conspiracy theory. Thet just about covered it.If you're the kind of person that gets hung up on a out of context comment from well over a year ago then you're probably perfect for the community. We always welcome anyone skilled at hermeutics. 

Must have. Because we've never met.

Just scratch out the usernames.

What are you even talking about?

> Similarly, I always approve comments from shadowbanned users when I see them, and I then will inform them of their predicament.Could you clarify why you do this? You frequently criticize the admins for not properly moderating this website, but on the rare occasion that they do take action on something you actively undermine them. You rightfully criticize the admins for not taking action on hostile sub members using alts to bypass your bans, but the entire point of a shadowban is to keep the recipient in the dark so they don't make an alt, right?You don't seem to actually base it off the quality of their post since I've seen more than one occasion where you  [approve comments from obvious spambots posting suspicious links that have nothing to do with the topic](https://archive.is/EfrHO), so I'd like to hear your thought process behind this.

Don't you find it somewhat ironic that the "transparency mission" of this sub now means there are at least two offshoot subs where users have to "prove themselves" and then another tier for users who have "proven themselves"?Like, there are shills on reddit, that's a given, so your reaction with these sister subs, while ostensibly appearing to crack down on shills, really only has the effect of making it more difficult for legitimate new users to join the discussion.If paid actors are being used to infiltrate/slide discussions, they wouldn't have a problem either 1)paying for aged accounts 2)playing along for the 2 or 3 months to get "in".The whole setup just seems counter intuitive to the free flow of information in my opinion. 

 

I wont hold my breath then.  These have never produced anything or value before imho. 

Message the mods.

I think you should  be! You belong here just as much as i do.

Maybe you are so busy you forgot.

Wait so everyone can pull up the mod log and look at the names directly, but if anyone takes a screenshot of the thing we‚Äôre all already looking at, it‚Äôs a violation? Why? It‚Äôs the same information that you already make publicly available... 

Shadowbanning is an extremely controversial practice, and you'd be hard pressed to find *anyone* on /r/conspiracy that truly thinks shadowbanning is anything but a sketchy and underhanded way to deal with users that ostensibly break the rules.Some folks have commented for *years* without knowing they're shadowbanned, and tbh that's fucked up.>but on the rare occasion that they do take actionThe admins take action on stuff *all the time*...shadowbanning is one of many things they do, but it's definitely one of the most unscrupulous and unfair.>but the entire point of a shadowban is to keep the recipient in the dark.Is it? Shadowbanning is done based off the user's IP address, so creating alts isn't possible without masking it (which ban evaders would do anyway).Shadowbanning as it exists now is simply lazy moderation. I'm of the opinion that the admins should extend the courtesy to these individuals of at least informing them that they've been banned.Also, you are assuming that the admins are *infallible* when they choose to shadowban. They're not.>you actively undermine them.Undermining them would be reversing the shadowban (which I can't do) or approving content that breaks the rules of reddit (which I don't do).I don't see any problem with approving these comments and extending this courtesy to these individuals. In fact, I'm often lauded for doing so. This is the first time anyone has ever raised concerns over this practice (which I appreciate and it's why I'm addressing your concerns!).>where you approve comments from obvious spambots You've posted the archive link on this...I checked the actual thread and my comment isn't even there and that user's comment has been removed.This was about a month ago...it looks like I mistakenly approved their comment and then when I followed the link and realized it was spam I deleted my comment.>I've seen more than one occasionWhat's the other occasion? This one doesn't really count because I fixed the mistake right away.I'm *extremely* careful in the current environment to never approve anything that breaks reddit's TOS.AFAIK, the reddit admins have no stated policy on the approval of comments from shadowbanned users, and TBH, as long as they follow the rules, I really don't think they even care.

Maybe! I haven't seen any... Maybe some minimum wage would be nice for some of these mods.... I'll be straight up with you!  The amount of shit/work these guys do is a full time job... And I don't Include myself in that category.  When I see back biters harassing them, my anger goes to a full on for-profit company that is owned by the 4th largest conglomerate in NY in 2012 (Advance Publications):>[ Crain's ranked Advance Publications the 4th largest private company in the New York area in 2012.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications).

>Can you back *any* if the things you said above?

Done. Now we wait

I must have misunderstood. 

>Wait so everyone can pull up the mod log and look at the names directly, Nothing wrong with that.>but if anyone takes a screenshot of the thing we‚Äôre all already looking at, it‚Äôs a violation? It is when you screenshot the comment with the username attached. The modlog doesn't disclose anything about any contribution a user may have made. Just that they did something, and then *we* did something.  Do you see the difference?>Why? Because they are different. I hope I cleared it up for you above.>It‚Äôs the same information that you already make publicly available... No, it's not.

Can you disprove any of them?Im not gonna waste my time to go dig through my saved history and share them when you and people like you on mod team will either ignore it or use it for some nefarious action like banning me for criticizing the sub. The new mod additions were done out of site and extremely suspect. Theres one right there.  And over time the sub has become extremely political and over represents the castoffs of certain banned subs. You have yet to ban the account that posts the same mein kempf post multiples in a day and every few days. How about just that to start? 

How could a screenshot of a mod log disclose *more* info than the log itself? That‚Äôs impossible... 

>Can you disprove any of them?Not how this works. >Im not gonna waste my time to go dig through my saved history and share them when you and people like you on mod team will either ignore it or use it for some nefarious action like banning me for criticizing the sub. I move to dismiss based on lack of evidence.>The new mod additions were done out of site and extremely suspect. Theres one right there.  Mods were added in a way we saw fit. Some were great.

But the good news is this year's class is looking great, too.>And over time the sub has become extremely political and over represents the castoffs of certain banned subs. So because we don't ban them too? Just start reporting the accounts you don't like and I'll be sure to take care of it for ya. Give me a break.>You have yet to ban the account that posts the same mein kempf post multiples in a day and every few days. Use the report feature. >How about just that to start? So far so good.

The modlog doesn't show the comment in question.Honestly - how hard is this to grasp?

Fine we‚Äôll keep it simple to help not waste time on more condescending snark. I personally have reported that users and their mein kempf spam posts multiple times. Yet they are still allowed to persist. Meanwhile users with way less of an agenda are banned for single comments. How are the reports concerning the blatant spam posts allowed to continue?

Hey JCP, different dude here reading up on this thread. Are the comments in the screenshots different than the ones in the modlog?  Just curious. 

>Fine we‚Äôll keep it simple to help not waste time on more condescending snark. I'm not wasting time. I'm workin'. In more ways than one.>I personally have reported that users and their mein kempf spam posts multiple times.What rule does it break? Did it ever occur to you that it was actually not against the rules? Again - it's tough for me to make a ruling without you being able to link it.>Yet they are still allowed to persist. Meanwhile users with way less of an agenda are banned for single comments. How are the reports concerning the blatant spam posts allowed to continue?Perhaps they aren't that blatant?

The act of a user screenshotting a user's comment without redacting their name is against reddit's TOS linked in this thread.Pointing to the modlog is immaterial as the the modlog is not a user, but a reddit-based service, and a dead end.

Repeat posts of the same exact posts multiple times within a day. 

Okay but did you see his question? It was >Are the comments in the screenshots **different** than the ones in the modlog?

Yeah that shouldn't last. Feel free to shout me next time too.

He answered it.  

A book that really broke this concept open for me was Lynn Mctaggart's, "The Field".https://www.amazon.com/Field-Quest-Secret-Force-Universe/dp/006143518XIt really blew my mind. She gets into the P.E.A.R research at Stanford utilizing the manipulation of a random event generator by people.This also leads into the topic of consciousness research through the installation of REG machines around the world, recording data 24/7 and correlating to events the world pays attention to. The research is honestly incredible to look into.Global Consciousness Project - http://noosphere.princeton.edu/

I've been hacking away at the book [Real Magic](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Magic-Ancient-Science-Universe/dp/1524758825/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1549472252&sr=8-1&keywords=real+magic+dean) and it examines many phenomena from a scientific perspective. It starts to examine the history and suppression of beliefs in Magic, and concludes with the findings of experiments that have been done to study it. While we are likely not able to fly, teleport or move things with our mind, it is very possible that we are able to connect with the universe at a conscious level and influence it to some degree. 

It can't all be bullshit, the CIA and project Stargate, I mean the government payed thousands of taxpayer dollars to research this stuff; Astral projection, remote viewing ect. Part and parcel of reaching to obtain "full spectrum dominance".

Wow, really pumped this was the selection! My whole goal with sharing that video around here lately was just so that as many people as possible could hear about Chang and from there allow a discussion to occur, which we just got!Let me give some additional context on the topic from a more scientific point of view: *(Thanks to some dedicated researchers for putting this together)*______________________________________________________________https://vimeo.com/269359104The researchers included:Gregory V. Simpson, Ph.D. is a neuroscientist, formerly the Director of the Dynamic Neuroimaging Laboratory at UCSF, Co-Director, Dynamic Brain Activity Imaging Laboratory at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a Senior Scientist at the Brain Plasticity Institute.Also present were a Medical Doctor and the head of the Mind Science Foundation.The subject was stripped to his underwear, and an undershirt and searched with a metal detector. He then gave a demonstration inside his home. After that, he gave another demonstration outside his home. Then the researchers took him to a random location they chose for a final demonstration.Some things to keep in mind John never charged any patient, or student anything. He also did not accept donations of any kind. After this video aired he retired and left his top student in charge.More importantly than that, this isn't a faith based practice. Students are able to practice and see directly for themselves.______________________________________________________________________A more well studied practice, known as Tummo and practiced by Tibetan buddhists, is quite similar to the foundations of Chang's practice.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WajTafbG7IIhttps://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2002/04/meditation-changes-temperatures/https://www.nature.com/articles/295234a0"During visits to remote monasteries in the 1980s, Benson and his team studied monks living in the Himalayan Mountains who could, by g Tum-mo meditation, raise the temperatures of their fingers and toes by as much as 17 degrees. It has yet to be determined how the monks are able to generate such heat."Dr. Herbert Benson of Harvard Medical, also published in the journal nature.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130408084858.htmhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058244"The researchers collected data during the unique ceremony in Tibet, where nuns were able to raise their core body temperature and dry up wet sheets wrapped around their bodies in the cold Himalayan weather (-25 degree Celsius) while meditating."___________________________________________________________A similar, but more modern and well studied case is that of Wim Hof. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqsvJedwUyghttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110422090203.htmhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22685240"Pickkers said: "We administer endotoxin, a dead cell-wall component of bacteria, to healthy volunteers. The immune system reacts as if real live bacteria have entered the body and mounts an immune response characterized by the production of inflammatory mediators and flu-like symptoms like fever, chills and headache. These experiments are completely safe and have been performed on more than 240 subjects in our centre."...Wim Hof is well known for his remarkable activities in extremely low temperatures. Hof claims that he can influence his autonomic nervous system and thereby suppress his immune response through concentration and meditation.To investigate this, Hof was administered endotoxin while practicing his concentration and meditation technique. During this experiment, various measurements were performed, including brain activity, autonomic nervous system activity and inflammatory mediators in the blood."Wim is one of the few westerners to have learned tum mo, holds all the cold endurance world records, and has been packed in ice for hours, run marathons above the arctic circle barefoot, and lots of other amazing demonstrations.

I'm currently reading "Stalking the Wild Pendulum" which presents a stunning thesis including the idea that our brain doesn't generate consciousness, but amplifies it. First thing that popped in my head from that was the dangers of 5g. Which is relevant to the discussion at large, because if all this stuff is real, then of course we should be saying no to 5g (it is, we should).  I frequently think about the evolution of consciousness itself. Maybe we can direct the spin of our mental matter into higher dimensions by visualizing quaternions and stuff like that.

It's not really that fun being an empath..Lots of strange random emotions that dont make sense until you realize what's happening.

Awesome suggestion u/MansplainingToDo! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wYVdhKVb9WEhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TdYM0vNufwcThe two above links are John Chang, a master of qigong, which focuses on the manipulation of the energy field that is allegedly produced by the human body. Below, please find a "debunking" article associated with Chang (Devils Advocate)https://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/forum/topic/116478-john-chang-debunked/Separate from the above yet still related to the topic of uncovering untapped potential, Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Technique (NAET) is a form of acupuncture/kinesiology that integrates homeopathy in an effort to eliminate individual allergies and sensitivities the body has. The idea is to reduce your body's inflammatory response to various foods and environmental conditions as a means of strengthening the immune system. https://www.naet.com/That's a link to the site for background. They don't sell anything, but they help you find NAET certified practitioners near you. There are multiple levels of NAET certification that extend beyond the base requirement of being a certified acupuncturist. There's so many directions this topic can lead. Happy to explore any and all! 

aw man i missed the peak so this wont get much attention. but i think u/MansplainingToDo might like some more links so i'll ping him. too long, im not gonna read : im in this group that can do some weird thing that feels like adrenaline, at will, wherever/whenever in the body. looks like people whove gotten familiar with it can focus the "adrenaline" in certain parts instead of the whole body if they choose. **"adrenaline" is in quotes because we cant confirm its actually adrenaline** . a urine test disproved adrenal metabs-or whatever- were absent. and a secondary feeling stemming from the brain/spine is different, which makes me lean towards calling this source "dopamine". it feels like when you listen to a really good part of a song; that "tingle" feeling. sometimes the activity makes my neck/spine crackle. ive messaged a redditor who felt the same response, and is the only other confirmation that this "secondary" dope rush exists- possibly from the "adrenaline" rushand there is a third and fourth "thing ". the fourth is [this post](https://i.imgur.com/F7DmcP4.jpg). i gotta tell you im not super comfortable talking about these because they border fantasy hahain case anybody old sees this,i made r/forcedadrenalinerush but i deleted my old account. i dunno i just got frustrated, but i kept the old links and scrapped Post Text with them. i have to point out nothing supernatural happens. no slo-motion like the pdf on "[lentation](http://www.saltcube.com/img/lent.pdf)".its something i found very early on. i dont think it's exactly the same, but there were aspects i identified withand the rest of the links below are pretty much personal stories on a spiritual&medical board, about mainly the ("(adrenaline rush)") and one or two authors on possible "((dope))" releases. i havent updated since i killed my last account. i kinda wish i had kept in contact with those other redditors i found who could do this hahahttp://www.medhelp.org/posts/Commentsshow/263491http://www.dreamviews.com/fitness-health/88482-adrenaline-rush-will-8.htmlhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_responsehttps://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdfhttp://ehealthforum.com/health/making-body-tingle-at-will-t252192.htmlhttp://www.mysticbanana.com/i-can-control-my-adrenaline.htmlhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R8uKG-_386ksome people pointed me to r/kundailani or however you spell that yoga practice. but a mod advised it might not be it, because there seems to be an emotional part of this as well,anger, that can flare up the "adrenaline" part. flares up so much, it causes EXTREME physical stomach pain for a few minutes. theres a more extreme part to the "dope" release too. but the worst ive done is panic, because my brain pulsed/throbbed 2-3 times in a period of about 1-2 minutes. its happened a few times. but i havent cranked it up to 10/10 on either because im a bit scared of finding out if "too much" exists lol. on adrenaline, keep in mind from earlier that i can focus on whatever body parts,even "all"my body. why did i do either? it started in 2003 in my third grade; i did it because it felt good. now im doing it because im trying to see what comes next 

Cool topic! Here are some links I've found about psychic research and the unlocking of human potential in China and Russia during the Cold War. &#x200B;[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000300420017-1.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000300420017-1.pdf)[https://www.stufftheydontwantyoutoknow.com/podcasts/does-china-have-psychic-child-soldiers.htm](https://www.stufftheydontwantyoutoknow.com/podcasts/does-china-have-psychic-child-soldiers.htm)[http://avalonlibrary.net/ebooks/Sheila%20Ostrander,%20Lynn%20Schroeder%20-%20Psychic%20Discoveries%20Behind%20the%20Iron%20Curtain.pdf](http://avalonlibrary.net/ebooks/Sheila%20Ostrander,%20Lynn%20Schroeder%20-%20Psychic%20Discoveries%20Behind%20the%20Iron%20Curtain.pdf)&#x200B;

One of my favorite books that kind of explores this is Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein. The basic premise is sometime in the future we travel to Mars and that expedition dies. 20 or so years later we try again and when human beings land they find a martian civilization as well as one human who was a baby when the last Expedition died off. Michael Valentine Smith was then raised by the Martians and when he returns to earth he had what seemed like Supernatural powers. The reason he can do these things is he was raised by Martians, using Martian ideas /language and he goes on to teach many of the other characters how to do these things once they "learn how to think in Martian". It's kind of the same idea as if you were a civilization that had never seen War (or whatever) you never would have developed the word for it, because you had no concept of it. And if you don't have the basic concept of something, there's absolutely no way you can do it. You grok?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x4VTjbZtKcIm skeptical of these people. The above video is of a Chinese MMA fighter who challenges masters of various mystic arts, and absolutely man handles them every single time. So right off the bat no amount of chakra or kung fu will stop a grown man who has trained at regular martial arts from kicking your ass. As for the video in OPs link. Those are most likely parlor tricks. There are reasons that all mysticism goes away under controlled testing. The fire aspect is a well known scam run in China frequently. The best and only example I can think of people doing insane inhuman acts is Wim Hoff the Iceman. Seriously the guy can do amazing things but I dont think its supernatural

A lot of these phenomena are explained with Bill Gaede's theory of Light. "Every atom is connected to every other atom via electromagnetic 'ropes', the 'rope' unwinds at the "electron shell" and one *thread* goes through the center and one stays at the shell.It is the accumulation of all the countless threads that make the "proton" so dense. The friction of the winding-and-unwinding threads at the atom's surface as it pulses ("quantum jumps") is "Energy".Light travels fast, straight and retraces its path. *Everything is actually connected*. Gaede explains Gravity with these same connections, are you being pushed down by Spacetime, or are you being pulled down to Earth?This is not "string theory".Easy three minute video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NPZsUoEgVo Two minutes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE-ZunMoGpY

I don't even know where to start... There's so much. Things I've stumbled upon that could change everything. Key elements include dream interaction, willpower generation, third eye skeptical evidence, physical feats that shouldn't be possible, visualization of thought and premonition, amplification of conscious thought, high oxidation of the body paired with a more permeable mucus membrane to allow for higher level thought process, bodily manipulation (on a certain level), channeling of pain as an energy source, improved communication with animals, connection with a higher power, dissociative identity, increase in connections between left and right brain (that one is very important) . Questions, please, shall we begin

[Joy Milne claimed to identify Parkinson's patients by smell. On testing, out of 50 patients, she had 98% accuracy.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/heal-the-mind-heal-the-body/201802/musky-smell-and-parkinsons-disease) She did her latest trials at Manchester University. How many of us walk around with the ability to do something special like this, and we don't even know we can?

Sounds like John of God type claims.

Search for the book Chinese super psychics by Paul dong. Half the world's psychic population lives in China allegedly. Lots of research and historical context about people with powers. Also YouTube videos of chi gong masters. Setting shut on fire and moving things with the  mind on video.

I would love to speak to some more on Wim Hoff methods. He has been tested in a medical setting and can be proven. As for myself, I think people should start with practical applications and then move up from there. I listen to a lot of Tony Robbins and I am a huge fan of Earl Nightingale. I am a follower of Earl Nightingale's protege and it has helped me a ton in my daily life. I think that these type teachings can be used in more of a practical, daily life type help. They aren't earth shattering teachings but it is something that will change your life by teaching you to be more accountable in your daily life. That last part is something that I think people have lost in modern society. They take the easy way out, they find a boogey man to blame for their own shortcomings and have lost all drive because it is just easier to do that. They hear all of these people telling them, "YOU CAN'T DO IT" "The Govt has ruined everything!!!" "The American Dream is DEAD!!!" yadda yadda. When you take personal accountability for your *own* life, you lose the ability to find a boogey-man or someone to blame. You take the broad perspective, data sets, socio-economic indicators, etc... out of it and realize you alone are responsible for where you end up. It is very empowering when you realize these things. It is also hard but anything that has any true value, takes work to get it.

JoeyNoyola I request the utmost haste in your reply (through pm of course) and warn you to proceed with caution; but if you would like to see the goldmine of data I've collected on what you are hypothesizing and possibly be a key factor in tremendously helping the snowball down the hill...inquiries within.Edit: I also urge anyone and everyone to immediately screenshot this entire trail of debate involving "something missing" and seemingly metaphysical factors that seem to be repressed. Then, save those screenshots to a separate physical location that Isn't connected to the internet. I will also be looking forward to more responses and questions and information regarding this subject, should anyone else care to cast fear aside and step out into the light.

Human potential movements funded by sub-projects or foundations or through private wealth all mkultra. Important university research departments have ties with DOD and agencies. Alll cults if allowed to exist fall under mkultra. It hasn't ended, it's ongoing and works well, just look around. If any group actually helps people they'll cease to exist, like the Manson song. 

Help!!! Please help me share this story with the planet!! They have been trying to censor me!!!!The FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM is a PONZI scheme.The FED essentially loans the treasury $100 and expects $110 back. How do you pay that extra $10?Correct... you borrow an extra $100 from the FED and I'll expect $110 back. Which brings your economy to a grand total of $90 with a $20 national debt.How fun is that?We are DEBT SLAVES!!Wake up!!!<3

Have you read Koestler's *The Roots of Coincidence*?Amazing book that covers all of the early and (in the 70s) recent "psy" research, including Ganzfeld experiments, card/number/shape guess influencing, etc.Paints quite a convincing case, a shame and a mystery why this field has been so neglected.

The Field by Mctaggart is fantastic. A must read for anyone wanting to connect and ground spirituality and science (as well as many things considered "paranormal" or "supernatural" - which is simply the word to describe something that is completely natural but not yet understood and fully integrated into and by mainstream science).Another book that attempts this, but does so from a different, more philosophical angle, is The Science Delusion by Rupert Sheldrake (definitely not an anti science book despite the title [which he made in answer to Dawkins's God Delusion] since the author himself is a scientist, a researcher and holds a PhD in biochemistry - just a book that questions modern materialistic assumption of science and shows how most of them are entirely based on assumption and not on reality or hard evidence).A more physics-centered book connecting science and spirit is David Bohm's (Nobel laureate and famously acclaimed physicist) Chaos and The Implicate Order. Another perspective on bridging mysticism and science is brought forth by Robert Lanza PhD M.D. in his book Biocentrism.And yet another physicist tackling this connection is Nassim Haramein who also has a subreddit on Reddit made by his supporters r/holofractal , one of the better subs on Reddit to discuss the science-spirit connection and grounding metaphysics into physics. 

If we can connect with the universe to some degree why would it exclude flying and telepathy?

> it is very possible that we are able to connect with the universe at a conscious level and influence it to some degree.How do they examine that scientifically?

This reminds me of all the environmental factors that people think cause humans to see ghosts. Low-frequency vibrations, etc. Absolutely fascinating - and the most interesting thing I read on this is there are certain frequencies that can cause people to see these weird gray blobs in your field of vision.When I was in high school, one of my teachers told a story about how he saw a ghost once - and his description of the ghost is precisely the "grey blob" description I read regarding this phenomenon. Wild.

On this, here's a direct link to the declassified CIA document "Analysis and Assessment of the Gateway Process" which goes into biofeedback, transcendental meditation, out-of-body-expereiences, astral projection, remote viewing, etc.  https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf

It is entirely not bullshit, you are correct that is not all bullshit. Makes you wonder the reasons behind rank denial and hyper skepticism. Some of it is perhaps rooted in fear, some of it, rooted in some nefarious shit.

thousands of dollars? more like billions! have you seen the list of CIA research topics that came out recently? it goes way deeper than remote viewing (which is already off the wall nuts to your average middle American)   [https://gizadeathstar.com/2019/01/foia-request-reveals-bizarre-secret-projects-world/](https://gizadeathstar.com/2019/01/foia-request-reveals-bizarre-secret-projects-world/) 

The new documentary, Third-Eye Spy, is all about those programs.

Out of body experiences are a real phenomenon, and the idea that some people can use it for astral projection is a fascinating subject. I've had the opportunity to try [DMT](https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/dimethyltryptamine-dmt/) and had some very eye opening experiences. Just to recount some, I first tried it at a very miniscule dose. Much lower than the "breakthrough dose". When I approach a new drug, I like to research as much as possible and always start very small. In the smallest doses I tested, I had amazing experiences. The first was when I was outside and tried just barely a grain or two of DMT on a bowl. My vision became enhanced to the point where I could see individual grains of sand 50 yards away with a clarity that was shocking to say the least. My thought process wasn't impaired whatsoever, and I had full control of all my faculties.The second experience I had, I tried a slightly higher dose, but still nowhere close to the breakthrough dose resulting in ego death. I once again put a small amount of DMT on a bowl while in my bedroom and took a rip. Several moments after exhaling the smoke, I experienced one of my most clear headed out of body experiences I've ever had. My sense of self seemed to leave my body and rise above my body. I now had a visual point of view from above and behind myself. I could see 360 degrees from this point of view, and had full clarity of mind. I didn't feel high or muddled as I do when smoking weed. I was very clear headed. After several moments of this, I willed myself back to my body and was completely normal again with no side affects whatsoever. This changed my whole idea of consciousness and reality in general. Very cool stuff.

Ummm, have you ever considered that all of that is declassified because it was all actual *intended* as counterintelligence!?As in the CIA pretends to be pouring billions of dollars into this stuff by making a few bullshit documents that are then ‚Äúintercepted‚Äù by spies prompting the Soviets to *actually* waste a ton of time and money playing catch up to a technology that was all bullshit from the start?(Meanwhile all that money is actually poured into drug smuggling, black projects, and buying out the USSR with the Black Eagle fund which *never* actually had any Nazi gold).I mean, when you stop using wishful thinking about psychic powers, and remember that the stated goal of the CIA is ‚Äúfor everything you know to be a lie‚Äù doesn‚Äôt this make much more sense!?

I would like to further the discussion on Wim Hof as I am an occasional practitioner of the Wim Hof Method and I am convinced that he has rediscovered an innate human ability to create body heat and influence other physiological processes on command, and he is able to teach the average person how to do so. The Wim Hof Method is essentially a breathing and meditation exercise combined with gradually increasing cold exposure. The magic of it is in the breathing exercise itself, as this method of breathing enables your body to do some pretty wild things due to what Wim describes as super-oxygenation of the blood, which then supposedly sets off a cascade of other physiological phenomena. The breathing exercise itself is done either sitting or lying down and it is a very large diaphragmatic inhale to the point where your lungs are completely filled with air, followed by a natural exhale to the point where your lungs still have approx. 20% air volume remaining. This cycle is repeated for three to five sets of 30 breaths. At the last rep of each 30 breath set you take a full inhale followed by a full and complete exhale to where there is no air in your lungs. You then hold your breath until you feel the first natural impulse to breath, during which time you rely on the oxygen in your blood stream. Once you feel the need to breath you take a full inhale and then hold your breath for as long as you can. When you feel the need to breath again, you restart the continuous breathing cycle and go for another 30 or so breaths. &#x200B;I will endeavor to explain the subjective experience one will have during a Wim Hof Method session, but it is a lot of woo-woo and is different from person to person so YMMV. Subjectively, as you reach the end of your first cycle of breathing, you will begin to experience a tingling energy sensation in your extremities, sometimes it extends to your face and scalp. You will generally begin to feel what can best be described as an energized looseness in your body, as well as a clarity of mind similar to deep meditative states. At the complete exhale on the end of a cycle you will not feel the need to breath for much longer than you would expect. Instead of feeling the panicked neck and chest spasms of oxygen deprivation, you are just relaxed and feel at peace, yoga style. Then the following full inhalation and hold brings a rush of oxygen and you will create surges of energy throughout your body. These feelings grow and grow during each successive cycle of the exercise. At the end of a session you feel a relaxed calmness but paradoxically are also full of energy and determination. Its difficult to explain and is one of those things that has to be experienced to be understood. The second phase of training is combining the breathing exercises with cold exposure, preferably with cold water, so like a shower set to 55 F. When doing the exercises in the cold, you will just gradually not feel cold anymore. It's nuts. &#x200B;Wim Hof himself is not an especially academically inclined person so its difficult to get a fully scientific explanation of what is happening from him, he prefers to say stuff like 'the breath will CHARGE YOU UP', so finding a good scientific explanation is difficult. But people postulate that the successive hyperoxygenation and oxygen deprivation cycles causes an alkalization of the blood, which dampens pain receptor signaling and causes the brain to secrete serotonin, adrenaline, and dopamine, as it perceives danger, and its all these chemicals that make you feel good. Further the cycles of oxygenation create osmotic pressure in each cell of the body to absorb oxygen, so your blood oxygen saturation goes to the next level. There are videos of people doing the exercises while wearing one of the blood saturation finger monitors and you can watch it in real time. Supposedly this is responsible for the increase in energy one feels. I don't know the full explanation of it, but subjectively it works. You breath like Wim and expose yourself to the cold and think about being warm and your body will do it for you. &#x200B;I encourage everyone to research the Wim Hof Method some more. r/BecomingTheIceman is a great place to start.

Just an anecdote of how Wim Hof changed my life:For 4 years I have been struggling with nasal inflamation due to deformation, making me ill every 3 months. Didn't have time for surgery to fix it. I had fever, inflamed nasal cavities, a lot of  pain, etc. It made my life miserable, being sick every 3 months. Then, ~1.5-2 years ago I started doing the Wim Hof Method. I stopped doing it after 10-12 weeks (I don't even know why, I'm a lazy fuck). Haven't had an issue with nasal inflamation ever since. If I feel like I'm coming down with it, I just to the 3-4 rounds of breathing exercises. For me, it is a testament for its benefits. Nothing else changed in my life. It might be a coincidence, but I don't think so.

For anyone interested in how to harness consciousness, metaphysics, and science, is like to suggest checking out [Consciousness Hacking](https://www.cohack.life). There are lots of people working to understand, demonstrate, and share these phenomena, and put them to work for good. https://www.cohack.life/

Holy shit

I would not be surprised in the slightest to learn that the extreme pervasiveness of electrical fields (radio, wifi, 3/4/5g cell towers, the electric field generated from operating 2 TVs and 4 computers in every home, etc., etc.) has a detrimental effect on this "ability" or facet of human experience.And to your point about us being "receivers" more-so than "broadcasters", I totally agree. We are the universe experiencing itself. And I believe that goes further than just a common material origin (aka the whole "we are stardust" line). Thanks for the post!

It helps if you work in a job that provides a service to fellow humans. Medical field is good. Learn to isolate, process, and assimilate strong emotions you feel.

I can relate. I certainly have some empathic ability. I was like it as a kid, but then I sorta cut myself off from my emotions as a teenager so I was quite robotic/hard-line atheist, but then several years ago something happened in my life which forced me to get back in touch with my emotions (thankfully) and sent me down a spiritual path and now I'm pretty aware of my empathic capabilities. It's useful in the sense that you can understand how someone's feeling before they even say anything, but I have a habit of trying to fix things so it can be awkward when I'm trying to give people advice on their emotions before I even know the details of their material circumstances haha. But friends naturally come to me for advice so I think it's good in that respect. Also, my first impressions of other people tend to be very accurate, so it's very useful in that regard! I know who's good good intentions and who's got bad ones. But because it's not "psychic," per se, I don't know *why* people have those intentions specifically. I can feel if someone doesn't mean well but it's hard to work out specifically if they intend harm, if they want to steal, if they're gonna lie about something, etc.  Anyway, enough about me. Here's a great video resource (lecture/presentation) that addresses this concept from a scientific standpoint:  ["Rupert Sheldrake: The Extended Mind"]( https://youtu.be/9UvQwr9CscQ)  Sheldrake coined the terms "morphogenetic fields" and "morphogenetic resonance" in regards to the electromagnetic fields that surround the body and the way that they interact with one another when in close proximity. These fields contain information, and when two or more of these fields are overlapping they can communicate information with each other faster than you could with words, and if you're in tune with this and know how to interpret the signal then you can interpret the information. This is the essence of psychic phenomena. 

Can you describe this for yourself?

When asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, ‚ÄúThe kingdom of God will not come with observable signs. Nor will people say, ‚ÄòLook, here it is,‚Äô or ‚ÄòThere it is.‚Äô For you see, the kingdom of God is in your midst.‚Äù 

thanks for this bud, just finished the magus of java, reading through the end notes now. would you happen to know where to find more info on training for level one?

Yes.The act of observation can be moving, no pun intended. Observation does not require visual or audible sensory input, although those are the obvious ones.

Thank you! And thanks for getting that debunking article posted asap, as its a *very* common refrain from people who see this video, that the footage is "fake" or the demonstrations are "tricks" or the scientists determined to find a fraud are "actors in on the scam".I'd just like to address some of these and hopefully keep them from attempting to derail the conversation:-"Pyrokinesis demonstration was just "glycerin and potassium permanganate capsules mixed to start a fire" in the paper"first of all, this is what that reaction looks like (note the unnatural colour of the fire): https://youtu.be/kA12Y-B-U08And this is what it looks like when Chang does it: https://youtu.be/TdYM0vNufwc?t=159______________________________________________________-"Generating electricity - this is normally done with the use of a small high-frequency, high-voltage, low-amperage device taped to the performer's body. James Randi mentions this device here, regarding others who have done this"There are literally 3 scientists who suspect this, strip search search his entire body with a metal detector, THEN they make him do the demonstration at a randomly chosen hotel room miles away just in case he had some kind of "device" on his property that allowed his "tricks". They find nothing and he performs the demonstration at the hotel flawlessly.______________________________________________________-"Catching a "rifle bullet" - what is shown is the firing of a very low-speed pellet that can pierce the wall of an empty soda can. Then, Chang puts his hand in front of the gun. He is in no danger, and there does not appear to be anything extraordinary about what he is doing."The "debunking" seems to miss factthat he stopped this 700+fps metal pellet *WITHOUT DEFORMING IT*. Go shoot a pump pellet gun at any surface that it won't penetrate. Is the pellet deformed or not when it impacts that surface?_____________________________________________________- ""Fooling the experts" - they have a CEO, a doctor, and a physicist. They really needed an electrical engineer."I mean what? I'm pretty certain a medic, a neuroscientist, and a physicist understand how electrical impulses work. Attacks on the scientists are unfounded and don't hold up to scrutiny when you find out all 3 have continued on with their careers without attempting to make a cent off of appearing in this documentary.

Hey, thanks for the post. This does sound like bio-energy or chi or honestly whatever you want to call it, but maybe your approach to it is affecting your experience?If you think its adrenaline, it will feel like adrenaline, if you get what I'm trying to say. And to your point about "too much", what I've read really does point to this being a "muscle" that needs work and attention, as opposed to some innate potential that just needs to be pushed. I've heard many stories of disastrous consequences.I would point you and anyone feeling similar to a book like Robert Bruce's *Energy Work*. It presents a quite neutral, but most importantly *tactile* means of developing (to some extent atleast) this "muscle", without any religious trappings or non-useful ritual.Also, I'd look into the ancient conceptions of the body, learn the major chakra centers/meridians, see if they coincide with places you feel tension or pain. If so, you can narrow your search to practices that might help with your specific issue.edit: this appears to be a pdf of the book I mentioned, give it a quick browse and see if anything resonates.http://www.academia.edu/34692952/Robert_Bruce-_Energy_Work_The_Secrets_of_Healing_and_Spiritual_Growth_x_Robert_Bruce.pdf

> and a secondary feeling stemming from the brain/spine is different, which makes me lean towards calling this source "dopamine". it feels like when you listen to a really good part of a song; that "tingle" feeling. sometimes the activity makes my neck/spine crackle.Have you ever heard of [Autonomous sensory meridian response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response) (ASMR)??It sounds a lot like what you're talking about, and is quite popular.

No one who wants to have a real discussion thinks it's supernatural. By definition if it appears in nature it isn't.Wim practices a tradition quite similar (at its foundation) to Mo Pai (Chang's lineage), known as Tummo.You mention "regular" martial arts as if it's somehow wholly divorced from the internal arts. If you look into the history of martial arts, you will understand that at its inception, there was no separation between the two.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LkhVeW7VV0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvrID6ZlQnA

Videos are a bit funky but I can see there's something beneath the cartoon graphics...does he have a subreddit or forum or anything where he goes in depth? The link on the video to his group is dead. Edit: just found his quora page: https://www.quora.com/profile/Bill-GaedeHave you read about r/holofractal? I think you might find some interesting overlap in the ideas there.

Astral projection is very real. It can be used for remote viewiewing. Here is a class that teaches how to develop remote viewing skills. https://youtu.be/uij1clj9FzY the class is taught by a remote viewer that connects to her astral body for police to either find bodies or where people hide money during laundering/embezzlement. One may also access the Akashic records if they can connect to the astral plane. https://youtu.be/sQ7is6SCW3c

I've astrally projected once. I used to lucid dream a lot, and I can tell you that it felt much different. There's this hyper lucidity that came with my projecting that I'd liken to lucid dreaming if "real life" is the dream state. Similar mechanics between the two, but where dreams are an internal projection of conscious astral projection is an external one. But when you do it you just know from the feel that it's different.  

I've seen you post around here since before I made my first reddit account 8+ years ago. Kinda disappointed you of all posters would take the easy, non-critical way out of the discussion. Not only is it plain silly to try and paint Chang in this light (He's been happily married to the same woman since 19 with 7 children, he never once charged or accepted donations from **any** patient or student, beyond a one time healing or course of treatment he had no established "following" (i.e. harem) unless you count an extremely small group of male students, ended all further video appearance because of personal reservations about "showing off" with his abilities, etc.) but its a disingenuous dismissal of an entire topic because you happened to recently read a story that paints enigmatic "healers" in a horrible light. And misses the rest of the topic which is so much broader than one man.IDK...I guess I just expected better from someone with your prolific post history.

Don't gatekeep. Share what you got! 

Make a new post for this. You're currently breaking rules and derailing the conversation.

No I haven't, but I will definitely check it out! Looks really interesting.Thanks for the suggestion.

I'm glad you mentioned the books by Rupert Sheldrake. After reading The Field, I bought a copy of Sheldrake's book, "Morphic Resonance". That book was incredible and I feel like it leads to a lot of questions about the nature of reality.I also got into Stanislaw Grof's book, [Beyond the Brain: Birth, Death, and Transendence in Psychotherapy](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Brain-Transendence-Psychotherapy-Transpersonal/dp/0873958993) This book is a little more difficult in terms of easy reading, but pretty interesting as he tackles subjects along the lines of hallucinogenics and the brain.

> r/holofractalFor those who aren't too blown away by this, try also considering this material....[The Law of One](http://www.llresearch.org/library/the_law_of_one_pdf/the_law_of_one_book_1.pdf)

Perhaps there's something about the laws of physics that prevents it or something.  Idk.  Maybe we have more control over the natural world than we thought, but not complete mastery over it... Food for thought

Also interested in this...

Precisely. Goverments, agencies, and various other groups have been researching this stuff and employing certain individuals with various talents, specifically relating to these topics.I know this as fact, and things like the link youve sent, add more to the pile of evidence that this is a legitimate thing in the eyes of the militaries, goverments, businesses, and much more.The implications, both good bad and all of the area in between, well, some have already gotten to know first hand some of those implications, for better or worse.It aint all fairy tales, but its also no walk in the park.Id be remiss, if i didnt mention that my general perception, based off the information ive attained and experiences, those of my own and others, make these phenomena somewhat if not very close in voracity and profundity to non terrestrial life, other forms of intelligent life, and what many simply deem "supernatural."

Or maybe human brains are actually more digital than AI, because everything has to be one way or the other.

Hmm

Hear hear, it is a life changing experience.I got my hands on some after keeping an ear out for years (hard to get in my area) and tried a light dose the first time and everything was beautiful patterns - with only enough left to experience a true breakthrough the second time, i went all in.Nothing can ever prepare you for what you see when you break through - i can see how it would break some people mentally but for me it was the most enlightening experience of my life, one thousand fold more so than anything i have ever experienced. After a few days of feeling mild anxiety when recalling parts of the trip, i have now never been more mentally stable in my life.

Poisoning the well fallacy- The CIA lies - everything that the CIA declassifies that I do not understand or does not fit into my worldview is a lie.Quoting a CIA Director circa 1981 does not prove a stated goal for an entire agency, CIA declassified docs may be falsified, quotes can be falsified as well.   

In the FOIA archvies theres hundreds of pages discussion how the US felt it was playing catch up to the soviets who were vastly outspending them in "paranormal research" &#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B; 

Or just smoke weed 

> I can relate. I certainly have some empathic ability. This confuses me.....who doesn't?  Is this not just reasoning?  How can someone not be able to put themselves in anothers shoes...

I can relate I have similar experiences sometimes i even get a thought from someone its really strange.

I can. If I'm on my own then I'm only feeling what I'm feeling. But if I'm around someone else then there's a high chance that I'll be feeling their feelings over/on top of my own. The more time I spend close with someone the more time I have to tune in with their emotions and feel them better/more accurately. I'm I'm spending ages with someone then I can really tune in and even influence how someone else feels. I can't hear what someone's thinking, so it's not psychic in that respect, but I can feel their emotions without knowing their thoughts. If I meet someone for the first time, then so long as I'm aware in my own emotional state I can get a great first impression from feeling how feel. Knowing my own emotional state just establishes a baseline to compare the difference to.  To give an example, at my last job there was this new supervisor being hired. The day I met him I was having a great day and was calm as ever. As soon as I met him, introduced myself and gave a handshake, I had this strong feeling of sneaky/subversiveness/exploitation and as soon as I felt that I knew I couldn't trust this guy. Had no physical reason to, he'd done nothing wrong, but I could feel that he wanted to and that was enough for me. Over the next two weeks the boss heard complaints about how the supervisor had been walking around places he shouldn't be, eventually a coworker had ¬£50 stolen from her purse, then then he was never seen again. Called in sick and never came back. The guy had clearly been stealing stuff from all across the site, but it'd already been done at that point.  

Amen, the Kingdom of Heaven is within you.  Then he said to his disciples, ‚ÄúThe time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. People will tell you, ‚ÄòThere he is!‚Äô or ‚ÄòHere he is!‚Äô Do not go running off after them. For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other. But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.‚ÄúJust as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.‚Äù

Are you saying the monk was doing it through the act of observation rather than 'directly' controlling/influencing it?

Dude, I didn't even watch the video yet.  I'm not taking it too seriously true.  But Wim Hof is a bad ass and I've benefited from listening to his interviews.  Deservedly called out for uninformed comment.  And have been taking Reddit much less seriously as the censorship and control seems to be more prevalent as the years go by.

I need to check out Grof sometime, I've heard plenty of good things about him.

I've always been a huge Ra fan. I am not very fond of channeled material in general, but I definitely make an exception for the LoO material.

> but not complete mastery over itWell that much we know!  The possibilities are potentially endless.

I think you will find this article intriguinghttps://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/09/27/is-the-human-brain-analog-or-digital/#7d9f1f967106It goes into similarities in how our neural network has aspects of both analog and digital in a sense, but:"The bottom line is that the brain processes information using a representation strategy that is neither analog nor digital. It is a different type of computation, involving circuits and networks composed of spiking neurons. One of the central tasks of neuroscience is to figure out how this information processing paradigm works."

Mind elaborating on what happened during your breakthrough trip?

Just remember, everything the CIA does outside and beyond US borders, besides simply flying in international airspace or crossing international waters is by definition "a criminal activity". That's why they're forbidden to operate within US borders, not that they don't do that when they know they can get away with it.It's a criminal and clandestine organisation with a long track record of assassinations, sabotage, gun-running, drug and human trafficking, and wanton acts of terrorism and there's nothing that they wouldn't lie about to cover-up anything of that nature.

It isn‚Äôt a fallacy, it is *logical deduction* something severely lacking here.  Why would they be interested in google, amazon or Facebook if they can just use psychic power!?Are you at all familiar with Reagan‚Äôs ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù program?The CIA deals in subterfuge and disinformation.

Nah, substances shouldn‚Äôt be used as a coping mechanism. You need to find a way to process it normally. Otherwise it becomes a crutch then easily an addiction.Every once in a while is fine but definitely consumption shouldn‚Äôt be the primary way to process emotions.

Really the best advice for many of lifes annoyances...

Not exactly. Being "an empath" is basically like being psychic but with emotions. I don't like using labels like someone "is" or "isn't" an empath, because I think it's just latent potential within humans. A muscle you need to exercise. 

I am in this boat as well.  I can feel the intention (not emotion) of the individuals I'm close to.  The closer/more I know an individual the more I am bound to them as well.  I can literally read the mind of my spouse, but with strangers I can only "feel" what they're really implying behind the words.It's very hard to explain to others, but disingenuous, inauthentic, deceptive are the words I'd use for a lot of the people in the world.  They say one thing, but their intent is far from their words.  The person will literally say what they think, masquerading it by placing the sentence in the negative or in a humorous light.I can't stress this enough but from my experience, **every single thing a person says is for a reason** (or what they're really thinking).  There is no meaningless small talk or chit-chat.  If you listen/feel close enough, the person is saying exactly what is on their mind - without completely saying it most of the time.It gets disturbing at parties and large groups - it makes me want to stay home most of the time.  My wife can tell when I'm uneasy and helps me by disengaging with individuals who are "vampyric" or duplicitous in public environments.  The good thing about it is, although it seems the overwhelming majority of people I meet are not who they appear to be, there is even a greater majority of authentic real people out there who wish you nothing but the best (you just need to be in spaces where people like that congregate).&#x200B;

>But if I'm around someone else then there's a high chance that I'll be feeling their feelings over/on top of my own.Don't most people do that? Studies have shown that even dogs have that ability.

John 2:24-25

couldn't it be argued that they're pretty closely connected (with the difference being the exertion of will)

Alrighty, for context the only other hallucinogenics I've tried are acid (once) and mushies a few times plus the rare nitrous oxide canisters here and there - none have given me any full on immersive visuals or at least nothing close to this. So after hearing about DMT and reading about it being an enlightening experience, "mechanical elves" and all that shit i was very interested in trying some, i also avoided reading too many trip reports or anything that might influence my experience furthermore.I'll cut to the point.Basically i had a small cone (of weed) with maybe just under a point of DMT sprinkled on top and smoked it up. As the spinning lights and everything began to intensify i had to simply give in, so i let go and everything sort of sucked in and came to one tiny focal point with audio that sounded like something crawling to a stop and then there was silence and darkness for a fraction of a second before it all exploded out again, me with it. As i approached whatever it was (i was flying up a tube towards a light) i felt fearful and in pure awe. Then i saw whatever it was, something that could not be described as we don't have the words to describe it, it was made of shapes that i could immediately after not comprehend but at the time were amazing to me - i felt that 'I've finally got it!' feeling, like i had finally just completely got the whole point of it all - life that is.I remember seeing all these objects clear as day that i could never have imagined, they were incomprehensible, something that i could never ever have even imagined to exist because whatever they looked like or were doing makes no sense to my Earthly mind (however at the time it did ofcourse.) I remember feeling all emotions at peak levels but mostly the feeling of betrayal due to factthat 'everyone' had kept this from me for so long and embarrassment (mixed with idiocy) because it had taken me this long to "get it" when it had been so simple and obvious the whole time... These bad feelings only lasted for a few seconds before the entire experience sort of overwhelmed any bad feelings and I was filled with the feeling of pure joy and warmth as i just tried to take in everything whilst in a state of pure awe. God knows hold long this lasted or felt like it lasted, my memory after the above can not be recalled. This was followed by the fast paced, confusing and headfucky revert back to conciousness (or my body rather) which felt like i was jumping between various life events (most of which did not appear to be my own) and finally it ended with a small loop of me trying to speak to my friend where i would frantically try and explain something to him and then it would restart, which felt very similar to a nitrous oxide finish - As i opened my eyes i could see what looked like the imprint of peacocks wallpapered along my vision and i shook my head a few times as they faded all the while repeating "WTF" over and over and attempting to explain what just happened to my friend however not having the words to describe what i had just experienced, i remember initially forgetting i had even had any DMT and thinking i had just had a mental break or something - which passed very shortly after ofcourse.My friend said i had taken the hit, closed my eyes and sat still for 5 minutes (he said my breathing was so shallow he thought i had stopped.)Minutes after coming back i couldn't exactly recall what i'd seen, neither could i today - however i will always remember the absolute extreme feeling of epiphany, understanding and knowing that of the like of which i have never, ever experienced before... And there we have it.

Which is more reliable AI or humans? Which requires more upkeep and training? Its a lot easier to condition a populous to give away their information for free to a screen than it is to go inside their head and take it from them one would think.I don't know where the strategic defense initiative fits into this, but I'll bite, what does the star wars program have to do with unrecognized and underutilized human potential?

You are assuming the reach of this new power they might have or wish to obtain would be to the extent it would fulfill all their wishes...

Damn, that third paragraph... Well, actually you've nailed it on the whole thing, but that third paragraph specifically! I hear you on that! Someone doesn't have to be using any particular words to not still be *saying something*, you just gotta know how to listen. 

I believe that these abilities are inherent within everyone, but it just takes exercising/training the body & mind in the right way to unlock them I believe that our current society has been designed to suppress these abilities via the food we eat, the information we're sold, the jobs we're convinced to work, and the overload of emotional & physical stimulus that prevents us from tuning into these abilities in the first place. It took me a hard and fast trip down the spiritual rabbit hole to awaken what I so fat have in myself. Yeah definitely dogs are very perceptive on that level!  If you look into the work of Rupert Sheldrake (I left a link to one of his lectures on "the extended mind" in another comment of mine here) he talks about dogs and their highly perceptive abilities, and even factthat most dogs have a psychic connection with their owners and get excited when their owner has left work and are heading home, despite not being able to know this via their usual senses.  Emotions and thoughts exist at a certain frequency and don't necessarily remain within the head. The chemical action that denotes which emotional/thought centres within the brain are active and interacting remain in the brain, but the effects, the thoughts and emotions themselves, act like ripples on the surface of the pond. They radiate out in every direction, but getting weaker the further they travel. The mind exists around the body, though centred within the brain. A localised field, like a biomagnetic field. It's possible to tune your body to respond to stimulus of that frequency and read emotion/thought without the need for the other person to "physically" express it, but it usually takes time and effort. 

John 15:15I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.

I'd accept that argument if he could force the outcome by exertion of will yes, like the 2 slit experiment, not just guessing the correct result but actually making x or y happen by choice..

Wow, thanks so much for sharing.

It seems more likely to me that pack animals like dogs and humans evolved the ability to recognise the emotions of those around them because it increases survivability.I can't think of any specific environmental pressure that would cause humans to evolve telepathic abilities.

that's the implication! who knows if it's true though. earlier in the thread i posted a link about chinese psychic spy-children...in that article it says that the chinese gov't had recruited a team of kids who were capable of doing such things. 

No problem, sorry for the wall of text :)

Efficient communication. Humans and dogs are social animals, as you rightly pointed out, so this example fits well here. If you can communicate information mind field to mind field then you can, in theory, communicate large amounts of information to either an individual or a group of individuals without the need to process that information via the brain-body machine. There'd be no need to put it into words of a language and communicate it vocally. The information would be communicated practically immediately and bypass that function entirely.  I don't think it's just humans and dogs, but literally every conscious being that has this capability. Whether or not they utilise it is another matter dependent on local variables, but the capability is inherent to anything that is consciousness. From the smallest scale to the largest. There's information being processed and communicated on every scale and frequency simultaneously; on the atomic scale, the molecular, the cellular, the organismal, the emotional, and the mental. Psychology is applied biology, biology is applied chemistry, chemistry is applied physics, physics is applied maths, and from geometry - which is fundamental to the universe - all mathematical principles can be derived. Information transfer (aka communication) on any scale or frequency has its respective counterparts on the other frequencies. A chemical interaction in the brain has its emotional counterpart. A physical interaction as light enters the eye has its biological counterpart in the interpretation of that light. The physical action of speaking has its mental counterpart in the thinking of the thought which preceded the putting of said thought into words. If you train your body to respond to the physical senses it will do so. If you train it to respond to mental and emotional stimulus it will do so. If you neglect either you will lose that ability.  Having physical bodies its easy for us to exercise our physical muscles and respond on that scale. Thoughts and emotions aren't "physical," so to be more sensitive to communication on that scale requires the exercising of our mental and emotional "muscles." Mindful/vipassana meditation and yoga can help this. Even a psychedelic experience can help widen the limits of your perception. 

Ever heard of Joint Synchronized Attention before???Summoning u/Juxtapozed...

Honestly reading a lot of these just come of as wannabe superheroes. They claim telepathic abilities but downplay it, then offer up a story that illustrates how they just KNEW something bad was going to happen, and instead of acting on that feeling, regretfully watched it happen, confirming their belief in their superpowers yet never giving them the courage to don the suits and act upon them.

I've heard about it but never read an article, you got the link?I reckon we'll all be psychic one day; maybe not organically but by way of symbiosis/integrating with bio-technology, **cyborgs,**our humanity either diluted or dynamised, depends how you see it..?

I feel like this would be a really easy theory to test in a laboratory environment. Has there ever been a double blind study done?

if you google 'chinese psychic children' you'll find what i'm talking about but here's one of the links i posted: https://www.stufftheydontwantyoutoknow.com/podcasts/does-china-have-psychic-child-soldiers.htmand i'll move out to the woods before i let myself be implanted with proprietary technology. 

I referenced Rupert Sheldrake in one of my previous comments. He's been part of teams who've done scientific studies into psychic phenomenon with dogs, alongside other experiments. I suggest starting with researching into his material. To get a quick background on him I'd recommend his hour long lecture "the extended mind" which you can find on YouTube. 

I wonder which way I'd go; natural biology or supernatural cyborg, do you think society will split into sects like vaccine/antivaxxers and be totally polarised or just coexist peacefully?

I see he's written books on the subject, but has he carried out any peer reviewed studies?

i am no seer but it seems like division is increasing. either we'll go full-on 1984/brave new world unified top-down society or neo-feudalism. my gut instinct is that there will be another large 9/11 type event that sparks off a period of instability and war, and then whatever emerges from the ashes will be the paradigm that defines the next century or so 

Yes, but I'm currently lying in bed and replying on my phone so don't expect me to find a link for you. Shouldn't be hard to find one though. 

I tend to agree, but will it be an event that divides us globally (like 9/11) or one that unifies all of humanity, like climate change or disclosure of ET?I reckon another false flag, one that'll either make or break the NWO..

So I just read through Sheldrake's "The 'Psychic Pet' Phenomenon" and found it extremely unscientific. Is that a bad example or is that the standard for his research?

We're living in interesting times! 

Ah, cryptids. My kind of conspiracy. Curious to see which one is deemed most likely to exist. Im going with bigfoot, as he exists(?) across the globe, and across a wide spectrum of cultures. factthat giant squids are real makes me happy; i was so excited when they first found a live one.

Back in the '90s/2000s a couple huge topics among conspiracy circles was human cloning and human-animal hybrids. With dolly the sheep and all the sorts of advancements going on at the time in genetic engineering it was just all the rage. Then it got pushed to the wayside as a real fringe topic.  There were all sorts of stories and reports (no doubt loads of them were fake and made up for tabloid newspapers and the like, such as the famous [bat child who was found in a cave](https://i.imgur.com/wDr2Kal.jpg)), but some in particular that I remember were about secret military operations in which soldiers were being cloned and genetically enhanced. It's not too much of a stretch from soldiers being given performance enhancing drugs, which has practically been common practice for hundreds, if not thousands, of years across many cultures. Getting a bit more fringe, I remember stories of the US/Russian/Chinese militaries creating [chimpanzee-human](https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2018/01/scientist-claims-story-of-humanzee-human-chimp-hybrid-was-true/) and pig-human hybrids. For what reasons? I can't particularly remember, and I find it hard to imagine why. But interesting to think about.  Another angle on human cloning goes on into the elite bloodline/immortal rulers side of things. I mean, even today you have billionaires like Peter Thiel talking openly about how [transfusions of young blood makes you live longer](https://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/peter-thiel-young-blood.html), so who really knows what the hyper-rich (like, "own the banks"/royalty rich) people are doing behind the scenes to keep them younger. This angle could get off topic a bit if I carry on, so for this comment I'll just leave it here.

With the sheer volume of uncharted water on earth, I would say we can guarantee that any unknown cryptid would be in the sea.

I think the Kraken isn‚Äôt unlikely and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just a giant squid. At the end of the day I think it is a very very large octopus. Octopi are incredibly intelligent creatures and very adept predators. It‚Äôs not surprising that giant ones would start to stay hidden after encountering violent humans at the surface.

[The Sasquatch Genome Project](http://sasquatchgenomeproject.org/index.html)The scientific name for sasquatch is Homo Sapiens Cognatus. Genomic research indicates the species is around 15,000 years old. Sasquatch are indigenous aboriginal people. Their maternal lineage is human and their paternal lineage is an unknown hominin. The Sasquatch Genome Project was funded $500,000 and tested over 100 purported sasquatch samples. The study used standard forensic protocols and cutting-edge genotyping technology to determine the sasquatch DNA samples came from a human-hybrid source previously unknown to science."It has been a long and tedious battle to prove that Sasquatch exists. We have had the proof for 8 years now, but building enough data to convince mainstream science has taken a lot of time. Trying to publish took almost two years. It seems mainstream science just can‚Äôt seem to tolerate something controversial, especially from a group of primarily forensic scientists and not ‚Äúfamous academians‚Äù aligned with large universities, even though most of our sequencing and analysis was performed at just such facilities. We encountered the worst scientific bias in the peer review process in recent history. I am calling it the ‚ÄúGalileo Effect‚Äù. Several journals wouldn‚Äôt even read our manuscript when we sent them a pre-submission inquiry." - Dr. Melba S.Ketchum.

I'll just put this here; [https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/bfl39g/historical\_accounts\_of\_dog\_headed\_men/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/bfl39g/historical_accounts_of_dog_headed_men/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Does the Mothman count?

Skinwalker Ranch is a good Cryptid Rabbit Hole to jump down.

The real cryptids are those you cannot see.Known examples, the walking stick, the chameleons, squid, big cats fur patterns. All efforts to conceal themselves from danger and their prey.What preys on humanity? Other humans? Of course. The occasional wild animal? Occasionally. But what don't we see because it has evolved to be unseen? Lurking in wait and snatching people as it needs. How would we even know or notice? Even in America, considered to be a first world country, we have thousands of unsolved disappearances. Would we even notice the feeding patterns of that which has evolved to elude our eye?Perhaps. Perhaps we might. When it's too late.

I reckon Unicorns could have existed for sure. I mean we live in a world where dolphins with horns on their heads exist, why not a horse. I recently came up with a good point for anyone who throws shade towards the possibility of anything pre historic surviving to modern day. The Dodo bird lived into the 1700s and the main cause of its extinction was us hunting them. Clearly not all of them died out because turtles and other animals that lived then are alive now. I find it easy to see that dragons were misidentified dinosaurs that were hunted to extinction. The Panda was looked at 100 years ago like Bigfoot is today. It wasnt until Teddy Roosevelt's son killed one that they were taken seriously. With the size of Mammoth Cave, I'd reckon if you knew your way around those tunnels, you could move across the entire state unseen.

I missed these round tables thanks for bringing it back

Me and a friend once saw two "fairies" at a beach in the pacific northwest.  They were insect sized and monocolour with wings, one was crimson red and the other a light cream yellow like the meat of a banana.  I'd have written it off as me hallucinating but my friend confirmed it.

I love the Bill Gimlan videos suggesting Sasquatch has the ability to release scents that send off signals. Like the infamous smell accompanying them. This being a way to make people flee and also cause the subject to feel terror. Apes can do this apparently. The MK Davis videos suggesting Sasquatch has hair that can act as camouflage is intriguing. I challenge anyone to create a suit on a reasonable budget using 1960s materials with the level of detail and articulation that the Patterson gimlin film shows, until then I'm going on that every piece of evidence that emerges or enhancements that happen, only more signs of a real cryptid emerge. My out there theory is that they are a species of creature that live in the hollow center of the Earth and come up from deep caves systems. I think it's most likely an offshoot of man maybe between man and ape.]

the conspiracy behind the concept of cryptids is the propaganda of mainstream science offering the layperson a version of evolution theory thats restricted to the "tree of life" dogma, re: darwinism (but not exclusivly).  The temptation to perch Bigfoot onto one of those branches is one of my personal ways to judge the merits of a cryptid researcher. The limits of 17th century taxonomy are carried into 21st century and along with it the dominant politics of that awful era, the racism, the "vertical myopia", the classism, and most importantly "the grand design" dogma that the secularized religions of the deist movement promote.  Nothing to do with science as we use it today, and everything to do with today's politicization of science...https://web.archive.org/web/20181130104906/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/books/review/david-quammen-tangled-tree.html...article shows how theories of horizontal evolution render the "tree of life" dogma obsolete.   Get vaxxed and get evolved!

The Jersey Devil sightings have always fascinated me.Spotted and reported by multiple people within hours, across multiple state lines, and shot at by one police officer.All in a time when information passage was far from rapid and reliable.

I want to see the stats on these round table nominations!

i saw one of those big black cats once. Me and a friend saw it and looked away for a second to see if our other friend had climbed this small hill up to us yet then looked back and it had disappeared. No way it could have ran fast enough to dissapear before we looked back.

When hunting Rakes, or near one. Watch out for the Guttural Noise they make which will indicate how near they are or close in Proximity.Older/Elder Rakes posses Cloaking Technology and capabilities while younger ones do not.  They are hairless and can move faster than humans, so best to use Shotgun to wound when exploring Tunnels or National Parks around 411 disappearances. Many often confuse Rakes with Hyper-Dimensional Beings (Ghost) but they do not posses Hyper-Dimensional abilities.

Dogman are real.

hey guys, what's your take on the Chupacabra?

It's better than politcal conspiracies, which are just depressing and anger-inducing. &#x200B;I'd rather watch a documentary on spirits or bigfoot than watch a documentary on how Dow contributed to the Bhopal disaster.

Cryptids? What ones do I think exist? Well one is definitely bigfoot, chupacabras, and merpeople, the ladder of which if they are hiding somewhere then I prefer they stay hidden.

What if Cryptids in general all came from stories told in the past to cover up mysterious disappearances or murders. Sorta like how Jack the Ripper was likely a bunch of different people, likely lords, potentially some kind of occult relation.People seemed to have been much more gullible in the past. Tell enough people that there‚Äôs a scary monster killing other people, and eventually some will start to believe it.

When did this sub become /r/paranormal? Is the paranormal a conspiracy? I mean its definitely not mainstream but is it really a conspiracy? I just dont see how the blanket topic of "criptids" is a conspiracy theory. Maybe the treatment of criptids by academia is a conspiracy but not just criptids... Imho they are a form of modern mythology closer to faire folklore than the critical cultural analysis we see here. Does something like bigfoot really even belong in a conspiracy forum? It should be in a folklore forum.. but idk I'm sure someone can change my mind.. Does criptid just mean unidentifiable animal or does it mean some kind of paranormal animal that isnt necessarily tangible.Edit,https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/bhpv1g/top_mind_rmfn_is_furious_about_the_topic_of_theTop minds on the case.

Why do shills insist that we talk about bigfoot and UFOs instead of usury and corruption? Why do they want us staring at our navel instead of challenging the real conspiracies in this world? I see it all the time. "Omg I miss when we used to talk about aliens here." Aliens are science fiction. Why do they want us to spend all of our time on science fiction?

Science fiction is not a conspiracy theory..Prove me wrong.

It's clear the shills want us wasting our time talking about mythology and science fiction.. how is the one word "criptids" a conspiracy theory? How is this topic even relevant to this sub?Can anyone answer that? Top minds of reddit want us talking about things that do not matter. They dont want us talling about corruption and usury.. no that's no fun. Talk about bigfoot goyim! That's the important conspiracy.

>My kind of conspiracyRecently this has been a common sentiment when these sorts of topics are discussed, as opposed to political conspiracy, which many are sick of seeing.  There are at several categories of conspiracy narratives:* Political/power conspiracies, which can often be sourced and verified as factual* Mystical/fantastical conspiracies, which frame the world as a place bounding with hidden magic (such as this post)* Dark/obfuscatory conspiracies, where the world is a lie or simulation, and malicious beings are hiding the true reality* Historical conspiracy, where the truth about the past is much more interesting than the mainstream narrativeAll of these are valid topics, but are often completely unrelated and I could almost see separate subs for each of them.

For me the first footprints found in the Himalayans are big evidence because of how much harder they'd be to fake than in other locations.

Moth man is real for sure

We have known giant squids have existed since the 1700's whaling ships. Herman Melville knew about them...

Take a look at the lusca. Its belived to be a giant octipus that lives in the blue holes and limestone cave networks

The Jersey Devil sightings have always fascinated me.Spotted and reported by multiple people within hours, across multiple state lines, and shot at by one police officer.All in a time when information passage was far from rapid and reliable.

Only yesterday I was talking about Les Stroud and his big foot episode.

What's the conspiracy?  A systemic cover up?  Or a conspiracy to fake evidence of cryptids? Cui bono?

It‚Äôs absolutely crazy to think that someone hasn‚Äôt tried human cloning. The benefits from even just being able to clone an organ or two would be hugely beneficial. This work has almost certainly taken place even if it happened in secret.

I can see some prehistoric stuff still hidden since in the ocean because of the safety it provided.

Godzilla confirmed

Theres a lot of giant shark stories around that are pretty interesting.

Doesn't it have to be reported and considered rumor for a long time to be a cryptid? Like would you consider some new species of beetle from the rain forest a cryptid?

I've combed the seas on Google maps. There aren't city-looking structures anywhere that I've come across. I'd say if **merfolk** are real, they don't live in giant dick-shaped towers on the ocean floor as Disney would have you believe.

Those tentacles would certainly look different enough from a squid. Im reluctantly hopeful we discover a giant octo...itd be so boss. Octos are pretty smart too, so it makes you wonder how intelligent a big daddy would be.

Giant = eats a lot. Hidden giant = starved to death giant.

I believe most if not all female octopi die after giving birth, just something to contribute to this thought... They may not live enough to get as colossal as the/a kraken.

That's a very interesting one! Really bizarre!

Many bothans died to bring us this information

Yeah mothman has the most witnesses in such a short time frame - all recorded testimonies too. Kinda freaky

If frogman counts, mothman counts

Yeah, I think so.

For sure! VERY interesting. I like when conspiracies intersect. Cryptids, gov't spooks, possible interdimensional gateways...whats not to love?

when does the movie come out?!

For real, a horn on a horse isnt that crazy at all, its not like it has to be magical.

Serious question: Has there ever been any Form of scientific evidence or notion towards the existence of unicorns?

That name has me dying

What were they doing?

I don't understand this post at all but it sure sounds confident

One of the better posts I‚Äôve seen here in a longTime. Excellent prose. Concise. To the point. Post more.

Yeah, I didn't even see this one, let alone get a chance to vote in it. Don't get me wrong, I love the topic! But I just wish I'd been able to contribute in the nomination post. I feel like normally the nomination post is up for several days.

your young rakes links are to debunked videos just so you knowlove nukes channel though

I think people being more gullible in the past is a misconception that is actually the source of many conspiracies and also results in like everything this sub discusses being relegated to "conspiracy theories"

This sub had plenty of /r/paranormal-like posts before your time (aka before a lot of the political shitposting started).

I guess it ties into history being hidden from us and rewritten multiple times.

Way to ruin a round table...

You aren't here for conspiracies you are here for politics. The worst kind of user in this sub.

/r/gatekeeping

https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/bhpv1g/top_mind_rmfn_is_furious_about_the_topic_of_theMy point exactly.

Stop spamming this thread. The topic of discussion is about cryptids. Get over it. Join in the discussion or don't, but either way stop whining about it.

The discussion about aliens/cryptids/ufos/etc isn't science fiction.  the discussions center around those things being suppressed science fact.the conspiracy aspect is that these things are being supressed by those who know more than we do.  why would they do this? and heres a post for us to share what we know that you wont find elsewhere due to that supression

[This user does so remarkably well](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/bhmi6g/rconspiracy_round_table_20_cryptids/elugu2t/).RMFN, I *started* these round tables *precisely* to focus on the esoteric and "high octane" stuff. It was during a time when the board was inundated with political content, and it was drowning out our ability to discuss these fringe theories without being ridiculed and buried for our efforts.The Round Table circumvents this "mainstreamification" of conspiracy theories that TPTB are desperately pushing for...they want people to be conspiracy theorists, but only regarding *their* brand of conspiracy theories.The Round Table doesn't have to solve the world's problem in each iteration. It's meant to keep us true to our conspiratorial and speculative roots.

Its certainly not to say that those conspiracies are less important! Really cryptids dont matter that much. Its just a thing ive always been into. Its fun.I love learning new things, i want to know the truth about the world, thats why i come here. But it gets depressing...you can get into a dark place, focusing on all the evil in the world. Cryptids, aliens, ancient civilizations, are very interesting, and are a nice break from all the gov't stuff we usually get. There are a ton of mysteries about the earth that are still not understood. I want to understand, i want to know. Russia gate is a super valid subject, but its been beaten to death here...i made up my mind about it years ago. Know what i havent made my mind up about? Bigfoot, how the pyramids were made, were vimanas real? Its all equally relevant to me.

People are sick of seeing political conspiracy because it is often extremely sickening . They are looking for a fantasy instead of those unfortunate (real or feigned) realities.I totally agree all these could possibly have their own subreddit and we all might be more happy for it

Well I could see a separate sub for cryptids too, are these being covered up for some reason? is it a conspiracy that they actually exist? why?

Even post flairs for each category on this sub would serve us well

Sadly (but interestingly), the yeti is likely a himalyan bear-polar bear hybrid. Apparently ancient myths even called the yeti a type of bear...

I'm a big fan of the Dyatlov Pass incident!

Also check out the Flatwoods Monster from 1952. There were like 7 witnesses to the being on the ground in Flatwoods, another witness who saw it right in front of his car, and at least hundreds of people who saw it's craft flying around. Another one was spotted in another city within the same day. It was basically an alien in a very small auxiliary craft flying around with sparks coming out of it and stuff falling off while it flew over several cities and eventually landed. It left a trail of a strange oily substance. Later on it went into the woods to another craft that picked it up and they zoomed off. One of the AirForce pilots who was involved had his history erased after he died until a researcher found his brother and later the pilot's grave stone. Really crazy story.

Meet my friend [George](https://images.app.goo.gl/USyi7tH6m63EotiHA). Also known as Magnapinnidae squid.

 

For sure, we had just never encountered a live one in modern times or gotten footage like we have now. It was a legendary creature. Scars on whales was evidence already, but it was nice to get some real confirmation.

My friend is from jersey. He hasnt seen the devil, but he says the barrens are creepy AF

[I found this article from 2001](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cloning-and-the-law/). Obviously it might be a little dated now but it's basically from the exact period when cloning was all the rage. Legal repercussions for cloning human embryos - at least in 2001 - were from a $1 million fine to 10 years in prison...  Considering that the people who'd be most interested in this would be super wealthy and super secret naturally, and facttheir wealth could give them sway over the legal system... That's really not that much to risk for a potentially insane reward...

It can still be the last thing you see if you‚Äôre not careful in warm costal waters. You go in the cage. Cage goes in the water. You go in the water. Shark‚Äôs in the water. Our shark. 450 million years old, not evolving. Because perfection eats evolution and Darwin for breakfast.

Most of the ocean is just filled in on Google maps.

Dick shaped towers üòÇüòÇüò≠

Duh they vagina shaped lol

Not necesarily if they live very deep and are incredibly rare. We only recently proved a giant squid exists, the ocean is a huge place and we really havent spent much time in the deepest parts. Theres plenty of food down there.

Six gill sharks are massive and can survive on only one meal a year. They are on the ocean floor. Source: Blue Planet episode.

And they aren‚Äôt known to teach their young either. But one can hope... haha!

It gets weirder. I started listening to modern accounts of 'dog men' encounters and there were some recounted by the witnesses themselves which just seemed extremely difficult to disbelieve the honesty of their stories.Listen to this woman's  account and tell me if you can see through her act; [https://youtu.be/V\_etU8Stpo0?t=6160](https://youtu.be/V_etU8Stpo0?t=6160)

Yeah I remember looking at that story before.. like thousands of reports in one day if I‚Äôm not mistaken

Mimic

A conjecture, maybe. Seahorse-> narwhal-> horse -> unicorn.

I've heard theories that unicorns were misidentified rhinos

Are you in Africa?

Gotta nuke something

just flying around.

Essentially, an alternate theory of evolution allows for a little more [horizontal movement and tangling of genetic lines](https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/helenair.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/09/00984a2b-9f29-577d-8680-bb39c19dd51d/5c760966a2db9.image.png) than the clean splits of standard Darwinian evolution models propose. This could allow for a much wider range of genetic diversity.

It was up for 2 days, which is the normal length for these...also cryptids won hands down (2nd choice wasn't close).

Show debunking

Seeing how gullible a large portion of the popoulace can be currently is all the evidence you need.What makes you think otherwise?

Six years ago?

Yeah there is nothing wrong with talking about cover ups or academia denying evidence, but the entire field of "ghosts" for example is not a conspiracy

But that's not the topic. The topic could have been something like covered up biological discoveries. It could have been something that makes sense in the context of this community but it's not. It's one word, criptids. That's not a conspiracy...

I dont post about politics. I post about new speak and the tyranny of censorship. The JQ isn't politics. Its life or death.

How is the one word "criptids" a conspiracy theory?

... not in the slightest.

[removed]

Not even going to try to prove me wrong?

Why isn't that clarified in the OP?

It never hurts to put it out there...always an off chance that someone could post something relevant or insightful. Hearing user's personal experience is still valuable, whether or not there are pictures or hard proof. Im grateful for these round tables...its a little harsh to call it shilling. People have wide interests, its good to cover all the bases. Keep it up!

>[This user does so remarkably well](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/bhmi6g/rconspiracy_round_table_20_cryptids/elugu2t/).>I agree. They actually present a conspiracy theory. They arent saying omg cool freaking squids right on!!!! Maybe the topic should be more fleshed out so that people are compelled to engage with the topic. Idk pretty tough to have a discussion when the topic is presented as one word. Why arent there examples of criptids? Why isnt there evidence. My problem isn't the topic. I love the topic. My problem is how it was presented as one word... idk. >RMFN, I *started* these round tables *precisely* to focus on the esoteric and "high octane" stuff.

I care about this community. That is why I go about things the way I do. I want people to think for themselves.. idk I guess I should loosen up and have a beer. But seeing people sqeal over UFOs and aliens when there is no connection to the two phenomena just pisses me off..Imho this topic was not presented appropriately for this community. One word like "ghosts" isn't a conspiracy. I think next time we need to get together and we can put a small presentation together to get people thinking about the topic. Thst would be a good round table. We need to foster discussion. Not say "bigfoot, go!"

Well it has been pretty much proven that something like 80% of the pyramids were made by Geo-polymer casting, basically it's a form of concrete. Material scientists examined the stones and it was  also verified by examining the magnetic alignment in the stones. magnetism in natural stone would be all over the place, but for the pyramids they are perfectly lined up.[https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=geopolymer+pyramid](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=geopolymer+pyramid)[https://www.geopolymer.org/archaeology/pyramids/](https://www.geopolymer.org/archaeology/pyramids/)This was done like over 20 years ago but the information has been suppressedI guess it might not be considered a wonder of the world and hurt tourism and Egypt, Egyptologists, travel agencies etc might not like that.

There are already plenty of cryptid subreddits and some cross traffic. Everyone with an open mind is welcome here.

The definition of a "conspiracy" is when people work together to plan an illegal event.

I think it's possibly another hominid/great ape species. Like gigantopithecus or something.  Or alternatively, going down a more fringe theory route, it's also possible that the sasquatch could be a generic experiment. If humans were genetically created or modified (think annunaki-style) then it's possible that sasquatch are too!

I respect your opinion but disagree

Agreed. Misidientified critters and their tracks.Higher up in elevation snow pack is semi permanent. Tracks in snow are longer lived, slowly eroding over time, becoming larger and less defined, looking like they were made by a much larger specimen.

https://www.npr.org/2019/05/01/718729011/denisovans-a-mysterious-form-of-ancient-humans-are-traced-to-tibet maybe denisovans?

Not what I was referring to me I am too actually that one is so weird!

From Wiki.Nearly fifty years later, investigators concluded that the light was a meteor and the creature was a barn owl perched in a tree, with shadows making it appear to be a large humanoid.

I guess so. Whatever those japanese guys found about 8 years ago...i thought that was the first documented proof, aside from rotting corpses. I could totally be wrong though. I dont mind being corrected.

Are you telling me the ancient Greek people hadn't known of a "kraken". These entities are enshrined in folklore. Just because we find them today doesn't mean they were undiscovered...

I specifically mean the original sighting, way back in the day.Though I don't doubt other accounts of high strangeness, a la Moth Man.

The giant squid also used to be just a conspiracy theory.

Still would be pretty neat!

That particular story you linked, I dunno, I *could* believe that. It's a lot harder to tell if someone's lying from voice alone, but despite how her storytelling ability was utterly pisspoor the way she was describing everything sounded very real. The chronological recounting of the events, the way she said she could feel the sounds in her chest, details like that make it very believable.  I do honestly think there's something like that out there. I don't think stories of werewolves and dogmen were born purely out of thin air. But I won't be able to fully believe it until I see something myself that truly convinces me beyond a doubt. I was like that with ufos. So yeah, interesting story! Makes me wanna listen to more haha

I guess that's a way of thinking but it's still not a scientific approach to a unicorn.I just wondered whether there's any other source than myths and legends.

well... I dunno, horses didn't look like rhinos at any given time in evolution, if you can believe what is being taught as such.Anything close to a rhino would be a percheron nowadays :p

It would help with global warming...

I thought they were normally up for like 4 or 5 days. Or Is that how long the round table itself is up?

she posted about it on Reddit and was exposed, i didn't save the link.  also no one goes outside to investigate something theyre so scared of they can barely breath unless its a movie

Exactly I don't think it's changed I don't think we are currently any different than any Homo sapiens sapiens have been since whenever

If you'd actually been on this sub six years ago, you would know that.

Back when it was good and hadn't been infiltrated.

> but the entire field of "ghosts" for example is not a conspiracyNeither is "wahh this shitty subreddit got banned because *commies or something*" but that doesn't stop those topics from getting posted here.

>The topic could have been something like covered up biological discoveries.But that's precisely what this is about.

Ahuh and how exactly is censorship and tyranny not political you absolute tool. Your post history is strait cringe.

It both directly & tangentially relates to a broad range of conspiracy theories regarding the existence & subsequent coverup of certain particular non-human animals/creatures/entities like bigfoot, mothman, human-animal hybrids, chimeras etc.

Removed. Rule 2.

For me its a bigger question of not just the pyramids, but all megalithic structures from antiquity...other sites do have blocks that appear to have been poured in to place, made from a mold to achieve uniformity. But giant multi-hundred ton blocks at many sites still pose the question of how they were to be moved. I wouldnt say its completely solved...that website didnt have a ton of info. In fact it says it was done with advanced technology that was lost...so we still dont know how they did it. Not exactly a smoking gun there.

Not what I meant but yea. I like allllll kinds of conspiracies. I was just saying it might be easier for some to sift through when looking for whatever they want to look for.

That's very astute of you to notice

Highly unlikely. The remains/bones have never been seen or found.

Yeah I know you weren't, I was just throwing in my two cents haha!

Wikipedia is notorious for downplaying UFO stories. Look into the stories yourself, look at the witness testimony, the second and third sighting of the creature that took place, how some of it was covered up at the time, and all of the surrounding facts. It doesn't matter if some paid off debunker concluded something. That doesn't change what happened.You will be severely misinformed if you rely on wikipedia for UFO stories. Trust me. You can get the facts and the testimony yourself without relying on them. If you want to learn how a UFO coverup works, a classic example that will teach you everything you need to know is the Westall UFO incident.

And the sighting in Roswell was a weather balloon.

Ye Olde Barn Owl ü¶â

I had one of those Time Life Mysteries of the Unknown books, I used to stare at that pic as a kid like Arnold in Predator...what the hell are you? I know they say it's a rotting whale or shark but since they threw it away who knows.

Yeah, that's apparently what a cryptid is. Something that we have accounts of from folklore, but no firsthand sightings. The city of Troy was believed to be fake until they found it. And they still believe Atlantis to be fake. Prob not much different with other things like the kraken.

Interestingly enough the kraken has nothing to do with Greece. They did have a see monster called the Scylla which is more of a water dragon thingy, but they never had a giant octopus or squid in their folklore.Scandinavia does and so does Japan though.

So did the giant human...

That's the whole point. Her story telling ability is shit. She tangents off and tells all this BS about things that aren't relevant. But you hear the emotion in her voice when she talks about how she didn't think she could protect her kids. And all the random info after that.2 things; 1. the V shape, like body builders. And the popping sound, like cracking knuckles when they stand full height. I've heard these things repeated almost verbatim in a lot accounts now.I don't know, the guy that runs the channel is doing it for money so it's not impossible the whole thing could be an elaborate scam. Would be good to have people look at diverse accounts to see what commonalities there are.

2 days for voting, and usually 7-8 days for the actual thread.

interesting. I was not aware. What do you know about Cryptids during wartime? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEXDOv3Nfm0

I was.. I've been here since 2013.

>Neither is "wahh this shitty subreddit got banned because *commies or something*" but that doesn't stop those topics from getting posted here.Censorship brought about by the coordinated effort of organizations like the adl and splc who are colluding with admins of this website to silence specific types of political speech is literally the definition of a conspiracy...

But it isn't. The topic is "criptids". Not the coverup of criptids. There is a difference.. isn't there? I have seen three UFOs in my life. I have seen strange animals in the woods. I have seen 300lb snapping turtles that have 5 ft necks. But that isnt a conspiracy. That's my experience. If I went to talk about my experiences and somone wearing a black suit came to me and said if you talk about that we will have to silence you. Or you'll be sorry now that is a conspiracy... Idk. I think its important for topics to be fleshed out onto a presentation before being used as a round table. One word isnt enough to start a discussion. In college or something analogous have you ever been to a speaking event that was described with one word.. We should treat this like a symposium. :"Criptids coverup how urban academics deny the evidence of rare unidentified animals." Now that is a round table topic.

Are you pro censorship?

There can be corporate tyranny.. tyranny can by in any form.

How so?

huh? it kind of is a smoking gun .... to the pyramids ....which was the point.Your extrapolating it different structures and sad that it dosen't explain them all??? And no it's not completely solved that's also why I said 80% or so, it's not the humongous mystery egyptologists make it out to be.And WHERE does it say advanced technology that was lost in regard's to moving big stones?? you sure they aren't talking about their geopolymer process?

You messin' with me?!

True that. But to entertain the possibility, reports of bigfoot/sasquatch/yeti have been that they at least have some degree of intelligence. Assuming that, then it would be possible they have burial rituals.  But obviously that's just speculation.

Uh yeah, because they're immortal.

Haha ok just got confused for a sec.

They know Atlantis isn‚Äôt fake, they get their fucking ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù from the remnants of the knowledge of this very civilization. That‚Äôs just what us undesirables are told to keep us disconnected from our actual identity/potential.

You're saying the Greeks thought Troy was a myth? Just because authority figures from a different culture don't think folklore is real doenst mean the people from whose culture that originated didnt..

 

Reasonable points. It could be made up entirely. I guess we'll never know for certain until we know. Thanks for sharing the link though!

So then go back further [when this sub talked about UFOs and shit](http://web.archive.org/web/20110420010037/http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/).

Banning a subreddit for doxxing and harassment is not censorship, unless you also agree that banning CNN from this sub for "almost doxxing" is also unjustified censorship. And either way, that's not a conspiracy lmao.

Not when it's technically not illegal

Of course I am. And that's where this conversation ends.

[removed]

Bigfoot is an alien. There have been plenty of reports of Bigfoot sightings where UFOs are present. There have even been waves of tiny hairy beings coming from UFOs as well. They are just another alien species. That's why they can walk around in the woods anywhere on earth and be gone quickly.

Immortality is not a thing amongst mammals. Crustaceans and some jellyfish. And some trees. That‚Äôs all.

Modern scholars thought Troy was a myth until they found it

It's not about "different culture" it's about being verified in modern history with modern tools ie photography. You are trying to start an argument over nothing.

That was 2 sentences of nothing. Thanks for your contribution to the round table.If you let people tell stories in their owns words without coaching they usually tangent and ramble. Her story sounded completely organic to me. If someone with expertise in this field had some input that would be great.

How is seeing a UFO a conspiracy?

Why not go to /r/ufos?

Who did they doxx?

A group colluding to censor a specific political opinion isn't a conspiracy?

Conspiracy theory and the crime "conspiracy" are not the same thing.

Typical kosher response

Removed, rule 2; please focus on the argument rather than other users.

>How fucking autistic are you? If you can't figure out how it relates to conspiracies *after I just explained exactly how it relates to conspiracies* then I'm not gonna continue this conversation. You're either trolling at this point, or you're literally too stupid to converse with. I'm gonna assume the prior because I'm an optimist and don't think you're actually that stupid. But seriously, either way stop whining and either contribute to the conversation or don't.Wow. Just wow.

Maybe aliens are interested in these species as well? Maybe sasquatch is getting anal probed as we speak.

Is there anything to go on besides eyewitness claims?

This just confirms my theory that Bigfoot is a crustacean.

>Modern scholars thought Your problem starts right there.

It's not nothing. It's a false analogy.

What's your problem, dude? You're coming off way too hostile. Chill out, this is an open discussion. I've put in far more than just two sentences elsewhere in the thread (not like it even matters if I hadn't anyway).  But more on topic, are you trying to make a specific point here or are your comments moreso on the "simply contributing with information" side of things? Because you're contradicting yourself in your comments and it reads awkwardly. In your first it sounds like you believe her, the second is incredibly critical and dismissive, and then the third you're back to sounding like you believe her.

So then we're at the main flaw in your reasoning. That's great you don't like UFOs or paranormal topics, so just leave this thread and wait for the next round table.This is the same logic as me saying "go back to /r/conservative if you just want to shitpost about the right-wing's victim complex".

Cause it would (if real) serve as possible evidence for conspiracies about aliens, such as why the sighting was not widely reported (if confirmable)? Not everything on a conspiracy reddit is going to literally be a conspiracy theory from start to middle to end by the strict definition. There are conspiracy tidbits and conspiracy-related topics that can generate conspiracy-relevant discussion. Shit ain't binary, I'm sorry

Because this sub is bigger and the topic ties into this sub.

In the last few days? One of their newer mods. An entire album of personal photos and their name. And that's AFTER getting warning after warning for that kind of content.

I guess we'll have to agree to disagree if you think they were only banned for a political opinion. However, that's clearly disproven by fact/r/the_donald, /r/conservative, /r/C_S_T, and more are still allowed to exist without so much as even being quarantined.

*noun*1.  a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.

Maybe they're highly sought after for alien zoos and are snatched up rather quickly, hence why we dont see many...or rather the aliens need them for some kind of medicine or w/e

Possibly related to Lenin. Vladimir Ulianovitch Lenin. If you don‚Äôt agree, you‚Äôre out of your element.

And your problem starts about 2 comments back. The two of you are on the same page.

>I started listening to modern accounts of 'dog men' encounters and there were some recounted by the witnesses themselves which just seemed extremely difficult to disbelieve the honesty of their stories.  >  >Listen to this woman's  account and tell me if you can see through her actHere I indicate that I could not readily disbelieve her account.>That's the whole point. Her story telling ability is shit. She tangents  off and tells all this BS about things that aren't relevant. But you  hear the emotion in her voice when she talks about how she didn't think  she could protect her kids.This is a supporting statement. Well rehearsed liars tell good \*stories\* (you said her storytelling ability was piss poor..= not a well rehearsed story). factshe rambled and went on tangents was, to me, indicative she was being honest.Then you followed up with wishy washy maybe, maybe not.If this roundtable isn't full of shit then it's for intelligent and inquisitive minded people to really investigate the phenomena.My stance on this particular account was: I can't tell shes lying.

Cute how you can't answer.

UFO's have what to do with aliens? Just because you see a light in the sky doesn't mean you saw a space man.

How so?

Ah one of the new mods? So a false flag then.

/r/c_s_t?

Free speech subs are not the same as alt right subs.. being conservative is bad? What? Liking the elected president is enough to be physically removed?

Or harmful..

If you wish to report other users, you're welcome to do so. Also, discussion of other users is appropriate within the meta sticky comment (not elsewhere in a given thread).

What are we talking about, Walter?

Shut the fuck up, Donny

You said folklore isnt a first hand sighting. That's just false.

>If you let people tell stories in their owns words without coaching they usually tangent and ramble. Her story sounded completely organic to me.   But then you said that, which went against what you first said. You said that she rambled, said that's normal, said it sounds organic. Some people are just bad storytellers; doesn't mean they're liars.  And yes, I'll freely admit that I don't know if it's true or not, because I'm not so arrogant to believe that I know everything based on incomplete information. That's just the smart way of approaching things like that.  Stop trying to gatekeep this thread though. You don't have to be all-in, balls to the wall believer or absolute vehement denier. To be either of those is dogmatic (pun not intended lol) and idiotic. To take the middle ground is just wise.

Here I'll answer it since you can't seem to come to this on your own. Let's say a UFO is seen that belongs to an ET race and the government knows about it and hasn't told us about it then although it may not technically be a conspiracy because it may not be illegal it can definitely be argued it's immortal which is a core position of this sub that just because something isn't illegal doesn't make it any less of a conspiracy and it should still be discussed here.

Because we've talked about these things for over a decade. Don't like it? Then leave.

Oooo so then you can't deny that it'd be harmful to humanity to either not be told the truth of ETs or to not have advanced government technology disclosed that could help us therefore not being told the truth about UFOs is a conspiracy. Glad we agree finally

I have reported him multiple times but his comments are still up. And there is no sticky comment in this thread to discuss users. It's a catch-22. One user gets preferential treatment, then other users get their comments removed for calling him out on it.  Can you explain why this is the case? It's a clear abuse of power.

Haha, what are you talking about? That completely supports all of my previous statements.People who aren't coached, who aren't telling rehearsed stories will often ramble and tangent. Everything I've said supports everything I've said.I apologize if I offended you. I'll let someone else pick up the thread of logic.

Okay now that is a conspiracy theory. Just UFOs and just criptids isnt. Academia and the government working together to keep those things secret or hidden is. Do you see the difference?

In what context? Just the topic or the coverup? Which is a conspiracy?

Got him XD

UFOs =/= aliens. That's the conspiracy..

Every user has comments removed if they break the rules; I've issued multiple warnings to multiple users in this thread and else where, as an example.Beyond that, again, if you see a rule breaking comment you're welcome to report it or send us a modmail but replying by attempting to discuss the user themselves is also a violation (and will thus result in warnings for all parties).

Do you know what organic means? It means natural. To say that her speech sounded organic is to say that what she said sounded genuine and real, at least from her perspective. She *did* ramble and tangent.  Maybe you meant say "inorganic" or "artificial" if your point was that you didn't believe what she was saying?  You didn't offend me because I don't know you and therefore don't value your personal opinion. But your arrogance is seeping into your comments and lowering the quality of them, and by extension lowering the quality of the thread. Just trying to help you out here. I'm interested in hearing out and contributing to a quality discussion, not in creating a dogmatic echo chamber.

Nope seems pretty similar to me. Good try though. Was that really that hard to come up with by the way? Seems like pretty simple and obvious.

Many different contexts. You're free to go back and search but I'm not going to link to the separate thousands of times. Both. I literally just explained it to you in another response but here I will again since you seem to be struggling with the basics of Reddit. "Here I'll answer it since you can't seem to come to this on your own. Let's say a UFO is seen that belongs to an ET race and the government knows about it and hasn't told us about it then although it may not technically be a conspiracy because it may not be illegal it can definitely be argued it's immortal which is a core position of this sub that just because something isn't illegal doesn't make it any less of a conspiracy and it should still be discussed here." Also just so you know not everything has to be a conspiracy to be discussed here. This sub has become a place that people can discuss things not accepted by the mainstream. You'd know that if you were a genuine user here for more than a couple years.

How do you know that for a fact? Or is that YOUR OPINION?

I think the bigger conspiracy is that UFOs are always attacked when discussed :)

Wait how's that a conspiracy? How is that illegal? Learn the definition of a word before using it.

Evidently that's just a lie.

Yeah, I know exactly what organic means. I've repeatedly stated, with referential citations to my own previous statements, that what she said appeared to be true (at least from her perspective), i.e organic.Whatever you're doing is blatantly obvious to anyone that reads this thread.I wish you all the best, into that dark night you plumb.

Yeah it's a simple distinction but a very important one.

You'd know that if you were a genuine user here for more than a couple years.Replace UFO with literally any other word and its still a conspiracy. Just because you can hypothetically say this doesnt have any bearing in reality like all of the other topics here.

No ots not. There is no tangible evidence of aliens being pilots of UFOs.

.... I'm not attacking UFOs. I'm attaching the unsubstantiated proposition that UFOs are piloted by aliens.

Conspiracy theories are not the same thing as the crime of conspiracy. Flow that logic how is the word "criptid" illegal.

Well, we have an open mod log (and I also issue comment warnings on my profile), so you're more than welcome to look more into my claims.

I agree. Your behaviour speaks louder than your words.

Whatever you say. I'm done wasting my time on you.

So you're claiming UFOs don't exist?

"Have you looked into it? Do you know of the Betty and Barny Hill Case? Do you know of the abduction cases that left objects that defy modern medicine? Do you know of the many credibile members of the police, military, NASA etc that claim ETs are connected to them? Also where in the rules of this sub does it say things discussed here absolutely must be technically a conspiracy?"

That's I've substantiated many times now. "Have you looked into it? Do you know of the Betty and Barny Hill Case? Do you know of the abduction cases that left objects that defy modern medicine? Do you know of the many credibile members of the police, military, NASA etc that claim ETs are connected to them? Also where in the rules of this sub does it say things discussed here absolutely must be technically a conspiracy?"

What's the definition then? Link to an official one.

Fact remains that RMFN's rule-breaking comments are still up, but several comments from several users who've pointed this out have been removed. No clever word play on how you apply and enforce the rules can mask that fact.
